       "{\"SENDING AMERICAN TROOPS TO BOSNIA Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I feel compelled today to make a couple of statements about the President's message last night. I am very disturbed at what is happening, and I think all of America needs to know what is going on. I commend the President on giving a beautiful, persuasive speech, as he is very good at doing. However, I suggest, Mr. President, that as we are speaking now and as time is creeping by, our troops are on their way to Bosnia. It is my understanding that the distinguished Senator from Colorado, who will be here in just a moment, made a trip over Thanksgiving, which is essentially the same trip I made the week before, into the northeast sector of Bosnia, which is the area where our troops are going to be. A number of people have gone over to Bosnia but have not gone beyond Sarajevo and do not really have a feel for the environment in which our President has this obsession of sending our American troops. Mr. President, last night he talked about morality and about what our moral obligation is in Bosnia, and the fact that we have a moral obligation to see how many people we are going to be able to save from the brutality that could be taking place there. He talked about our commitment to NATO. And I would like to throw out a couple of ideas, a couple of thoughts. Mr. President, when I went to Sarajevo it was the middle of a blizzard, a snowstorm. We had a hard time getting up there. There were not any Americans up there. There were not any Americans going to the northeast sector, that area around the Posavina corridor and Tuzla, and south of Hungary, which is an area where our troops are going to be deployed from the lst Armored Division where they are being trained for this kind of deployment. And that may be happening and is happening, I suggest, as we speak. I heard several people say that we need to wait until we have hearings and let some time go by. But each hour that goes by, the American people need to know the President has a strategy to get our troops over there, to put us in a position where we are going to have to, by denying the authorization of sending troops into Bosnia on the ground, we are turning our backs on troops who are already there. And this is a position that we are now getting into. And each hour that goes by we are getting in deeper and deeper. I can recall not being able to get up there until General Rupert Smith, who is the successor of Michael Rose as the commander there of the U.N. forces in Bosnia, he agreed to take me up. And as we went up we went over almost every square mile of that area that is called the northeast sector, where our troops are going to be deployed, not more than 100 feet off the ground--because I have a background in aviation, [[Page S 17591]] I know we were not anywhere higher than that--we were in the middle of a blizzard. Mr. President, this is not the Rocky Mountains we are talking about. This is an area of cliffs and caves. For the first time I could see why during the Second World War that they were able to withstand the very best that Hitler had to offer on a ratio of 1 to 8 because of the very unique geography we are dealing with. As I looked down I thought, there are not any roads down there, there are not any valleys, not the traditional valleys that you would have in the terrain that we think of as being mountainous terrain. And so all these tanks and all these armored vehicles would not really have any way to maneuver in that area. And, Mr. President, I think the President of the United States is putting us in a position where it is going to be too late. You know, we could come back and talk about whether or not we should send troops over, whether or not there are strategic interests as far as our Nation's security is concerned. And by that time, we are going to have our troops over there. I think the President is looking at--he has been talking about 20,000 or 25,000 troops for so long now, for 2 years, I think it is an obsession with him. He is no longer thinking of them as being faces of real human beings. I think it is a faceless gesture when he says, we want to send 20,000 American troops into Bosnia. But I went up to where the lst Armored Division was training these young men and women who will be the first to go, who I suggest--I had breakfast with many of them in the mess hall. And they are on their way to Bosnia right now as we speak. And those individuals all asked me, ``What is our mission? We don't understand what our mission is.'' Of course, I tried to be as optimistic as possible. I said, ``We're always behind our troops. Whatever happens, we're going to be supporting our troops.'' But as far as the mission is concerned, I do not know what the mission is. In the speech last night the President kept using the term over and over again--he said, ``The mission is clear and limited.'' But he never said what the mission was. It is a humanitarian mission. And I think we have about half the world that is covered with problems, with ethnic cleansing, with human rights violations. I am not sure whether we feel that we--or the President feels that we--have the resources and the military assets to go out and take care of all these problems. Obviously, we do not. We are operating on a defense budget now that is down comparable to what it was in 1980 when it could not afford spare parts. Yet we are taking on all these humanitarian problems around the world. I had occasion to talk to James Tayrien. James Tayrien is from Poteau, OK. He would be one of the first ones to go. I came home and talked to his mother, Estella, down in Poteau. She asked me the same question. I cannot answer it. It is very easy to get engaged in these things and send troops in, but it is hard to bring them out. Look at Vietnam. It was very easy to send them in. Look at the other cases that we have. Mission creep. If there was ever a classical environment for mission creep, that is it over in Bosnia. In fact, we have already crept. The mission was to be peacekeeping. Now it is peace implementation. There is a big difference, Mr. President, between peacekeeping and peace implementation. Peace implementation is the recognition there is no peace to keep right now. The President last night said, of course, the war is over. The war is not over. We went up there. We were in Tuzla. We could hear the firing, the firepower that was going on. It has not stopped. And we are dealing with three major factions over there. And I suggest to you that one of the factions was not in Dayton, OH. Milosevic does not speak for the Bosnian Serbs. It was my experience--and I see the distinguished Senator from Colorado is here. He is the only other Senator or House Member, to my knowledge, who has been in the northeast sector, in the Tuzla area. The point I am trying to get across here is that those people who are around that peace table are not speaking for the factions that were firing guns as we were up there just a couple weeks ago. I mean, they are up there. They could be Croats. They could be Serbs. They could be Bosnian Serbs. They could be Moslems. We do not know who they are. They could be any of these rogue factions. We hear a lot about the major factions that are over there. We know that three major factions have fired on their own troops just to blame the other side for sympathy. Anyone with that mentality is going to be firing on American troops. But we do not say anything about the other rogue factions, such as the Black Swans, the Arkan Tigers. We have Iranians. We have all kinds of factions up there, more than just three major factions. I would like to ask the Senator from Colorado, if that is the same environment as I have just explained that he experienced just this past week? I am sure he would have rather been doing something else on Thanksgiving. But it is my understanding he was up in that northeast sector during Thanksgiving. Is that correct? Mr. BROWN. I did. We had taken a plane, U.N. plane into Sarajevo and got a U.N. crew, a Norwegian helicopter crew, to take us in that region. And we did a flyover over much of that area. I must say the Senator's description is right on. What I found was in that area that is absolutely ideal in terms of guerrilla warfare. What I was surprised to find, and I think Members may be surprised to find, is that the plan is not to set up a border and patrol of that border. In other words, in fact, they indicated many of these areas where the line has been drawn, it simply does not even correspond to things on the ground. It is not the peak of a hill or the depth of a valley or the flow of a river. It is a line on the map that has not been translated on the ground. And their plan is not to erect a fence or even to check people coming across. There would be free flow of people across it. But I found very rugged terrain, and I found the roads that were there were very narrow, and very heavy timber cover so that it would be very difficult to spot things from the air. And it would be almost impossible to get our armored personnel carriers and our armored vehicles, tanks, into full play in that region. It is as difficult a situation from a terrain point of view as I have seen almost anywhere. Mr. INHOFE. Let me ask the Senator from Colorado, since this was about a 10-day period between the time I was in the northeast sector of Bosnia, south of the Posavina pass and south of Hungary and north of Tuzla, if he did have occasion to speak to any of those who were in command up in Tuzla, such as General Haukland? Mr. BROWN. I did talk to the Norwegian general. He said he would be relieved when the U.S. troops came in. I also talked to Gen. Rupert Smith in charge of the U.N. forces there, as well as a discussion at the Embassy with all the U.S. forces. As the Senator knows, there is a number of U.S. military personnel who are stationed in Sarajevo. They indicated a couple of things. One, none of them expected this to be wound up within a year. Mr. INHOFE. This is the question I was going to ask the Senator. Even last night we talked about 12 months. When the Senator and I sat next to each other at the Senate Armed Services Committee, when we had Secretary Perry and General Shalikashvili, and we asked the question that they had written up, ``Are you going to commit yourself to 12 months, to a time period after which we withdraw and we come back?'' they said, ``Yes, we are absolutely committed to that.'' Did you find anyone, who were the military people, either with NATO, the United Nations, with any of our NATO partners, or anyone up there in the Tuzla area who felt there is even a remote idea or notion we could be out of there in a 12-month period as far as achieving peace? Mr. BROWN. I talked to Norwegian personnel, military personnel from Iceland. There were doctors there from Sweden. I talked to a general from Great Britain. I talked to U.S. military personnel. I talked to Embassy personnel. I talked to Bosnian officials. Nobody, not anyone, none of them thought this mission could be achieved or completed within a year. [[Page S 17592]] Mr. INHOFE. That is exactly what they thought 10 days prior to that time. I have these horrible visions of what happened with Somalia. I can remember when we were trying to bring our troops back from Somalia, and we sent resolutions to President Clinton month after month to bring our troops back from there. It was not until 18 of our Rangers were murdered and the mutilated corpses were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu that the American people finally woke up and said, ``We want them back. We don't have strategic interests there that are worth this kind of a sacrifice.'' I see similar things like this are happening over there. When you talk about the morality of the issue and the fact that we are, in a sense, rewarding those individuals who are guilty of the most serious war crimes, because we are now saying we are on their side and we are doing this, this is something that I think we need to talk about before a decision is made that we are going to go along with this, because I see that happening. I see discussions taking place in this Chamber and outside the Chamber, ``Well, let's wait until we have some hearings. Let's wait until this,'' and as this is happening, our troops are being deployed over there. Mr. BROWN. Let me say to the Senator, if I can, in response, I think it is very analogous to what happened in Somalia in this respect: There is not a clear military plan. There is not a clear plan as to what we are going to do once we are there. For example, one of the things you could do is put up a fence and man a border. That is not what they plan to do. One of the things you can do is you can stop people from moving from one side of a border to another, stemming terrorism, guns, ammunition. That is not what they plan to do. When I asked what they do plan to do with the troops there, there was no clear answer by anyone. The reality is, the President is committing troops to that area for show. There is no clear military plan, and there is no clear, effective way to defend or protect those troops. I might say, it is cold as can be right now in Bosnia. There is no structure there for our troops to stay in. There is no structure there for our troops to stay in. There is no supply of clean, healthful water. There are no normal sanitary conditions. There is no established supply line at this point. I suspect there will be at some point in the future. But this is a catastrophe in the making, and I believe it shows a reckless disregard for those who serve our country. I think we have an obligation to people who put on the uniform of this Nation. You can agree or disagree with the mission, you can agree or disagree with the personalities, but we have an obligation when someone comes and puts on the uniform of the United States to make sure that we do not endanger their life without a real purpose. Some will say we should not endanger their life. If you are not willing to put your life on the line, you should not be in the military. I understand how these men and women would risk their lives, and our freedom is important enough to do that. But, Mr. President, and I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, keeping our prestige high or avoiding an embarrassment because someone made a commitment they should not have is not a reason to commit American troops to a situation where they cannot defend themselves or cost American lives. We have an obligation to people who put on that uniform to stand beside them and do all we can to protect them, and it is very clear--it is very clear--that we are not able to do that in this circumstance, and, moreover, we have not even supplied them with a purpose or a reason for them to sacrifice their lives. If they were there to defend freedom, I think the Senator from Oklahoma and I would be right there with them to stand behind them and support them and to encourage this action to stand up for freedom. But this is not that effort. This is an effort to save face in the world community, and I think it is much more important to stand behind our troops. Mr. INHOFE. Let me ask the Senator from Colorado---- Mr. PRESSLER. If my friends will yield for a split moment, we are trying to get a vote ordered at 5:15, and I have to make a unanimous consent request. If I can do that, then you can go back into your mode, because they are going to hotline this. Mr. INHOFE. I yield to the Senator. \": 'target_text',\n",
       " \"PRESIDENT CLINTON'S VISIT TO ENGLAND, NORTHERN IRELAND, AND IRELAND Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join Senator Kennedy in congratulating President Clinton on his successful trip to the United Kingdom and Ireland. Although I was not able to accept the President's invitation to accompany him on that historic visit due to other commitments I had in Vermont, like millions of Americans I followed his travels closely in the press. One of the most memorable events was the President's speech to the workers at the Mackie Metal Plant in Belfast. Mackie's is located on the Peace Line which has historically divided Catholics from Protestants. People from both communities come together at Mackie's to an integrated work force where they work side by side. At Mackie's, President Clinton spoke of those who helped bring about the peace process--the political leaders, and more importantly, the people of Northern Ireland ``who have shown the world in concrete ways that here the will for peace is now stronger than the weapons for war.'' The President called for an end to punishment beatings as well as for the full participation in the democratic process of those who have renounced violence. He said that the United States will stand with those who take risks for peace. The President spoke for all of us that day and I ask unanimous consent that his remarks be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Remarks by the President to Employees and Community of the Mackie Metal Plant [Belfast, Northern Ireland, Nov. 30, 1995] This is one of those occasions where I really feel that all that needs to be said has already been said. I thank Catherine and David for introducing me, for all the school children of Northern Ireland who are here today, and for all whom they represent. A big part of peace is children growing up safely, learning together and growing together. I thank Patrick Dougan and Ronnie Lewis for their remarks, for their work here, for all the members of the Mackie team who are with us today in welcoming us to this factory. I was hoping we could have an event like this in Northern Ireland at a place where people work and reach out to the rest of the world in a positive way, because a big part of peace is working together for family and community and for the welfare of the common enterprise. It is good to be among the people of Northern Ireland who have given so much to America and the world, and good to be here with such a large delegation of my fellow Americans, including, of course, my wife, and I see the Secretary of Commerce here and the Ambassador to Great Britain, and a number of others. But we have quite a large delegation from both parties in the United States Congress, so we've sort of got a truce of our own going on here today. (Laughter.) And I'd like to ask the members of Congress who have come all the way from Washington, D.C. to stand up and be recognized. Would you all stand? (Applause.) Many of you perhaps know that one in four of America's Presidents trace their roots to Ireland's shores, beginning with Andrew Jackson, the son of immigrants from Carrickfergus, to John Fitzgerald Kennedy whose forebears came from County Wexford. I know I am only the latest in this time-honored tradition, but I'm proud to be the first sitting American President to make it back to Belfast. (Applause.) At this holiday season all around the world, the promise of peace is in the air. The barriers of the Cold War are giving way to a global village where communication and cooperation are the order of the day. From South Africa to the Middle East, and now to troubled Bosnia, conflicts long thought impossible to solve are moving along the road to resolution. Once-bitter foes are clasping hands and changing history. And long-suffering people are moving closer to normal lives. Here in Northern Ireland, you are making a miracle--a miracle symbolized by those two children who held hands and told us what this whole thing is all about. In the land of the harp and the fiddle, the fife and the lambeg drum, two proud traditions are coming together in the harmonies of peace. The cease-fire and negotiations have sparked a powerful transformation. [[Page S 18091]] Mackie's Plant is a symbol of Northern Ireland's rebirth. It has long been a symbol of world-class engineering. The textile machines you make permit people to weave disparate threads into remarkable fabrics. That is now what you must do here with the people of Northern Ireland. Here we lie along the peace line, the wall of steel and stone separating Protestant from Catholic. But today, under the leadership of Pat Dougan, you are bridging the divide, overcoming a legacy of discrimination where fair employment and integration are the watchwords of the future. On this shop floor men and women of both traditions are working together to achieve common goals. Peace, once a distant dream, is now making a difference in everyday life in this land. Soldiers have left the streets of Belfast; many have gone home. People can go to the pub or the store without the burden of the search or the threat of a bomb. As barriers disappear along the border, families and communities divided for decades are becoming whole once more. This year in Armagh on St. Patrick's Day, Protestant and Catholic children led the parade together for the first time since The Troubles began. A bystander's words marked the wonder of the occasion when he said, ``Even the normal is beginning to seem normal.'' The economic rewards of peace are evident as well. Unemployment has fallen here to its lowest level in 14 years, while retail sales and investment are surging. Far from the gleaming city center, to the new shop fronts of Belfast, to the Enterprise Center in East Belfast, business is thriving and opportunities are expanding. With every extra day that the guns are still, business confidence grows stronger and the promise of prosperity grows as well. As the shroud of terror melts away, Northern Ireland's beauty has been revealed again to all the world--the castles and coasts, the Giants Causeway, the lush green hills, the high white cliffs--a magical backdrop to your greatest asset which I saw all along the way from the airport here today, the warmth and good feeling of your people. Visitors are now coming in record numbers. Indeed, today, the air route between Belfast and London is the second busiest in all of Europe. I want to honor those whose courage and vision have brought us to this point: Prime Minister Major, Prime Minister Bruton, and before him, Prime Minister Reynolds, laid the background and the basis for this era of reconciliation. From the Downing Street Declaration to the joint framework document, they altered the course of history. Now, just in the last few days, by launching the twin-track initiative, they have opened a promising new gateway to a just and lasting peace. Foreign Minister Spring, Sir Patrick Mayhew, David Trimble and John Hume all have labored to realize the promise of peace. And Gerry Adams, along with Loyalist leaders such as David Irvine and Gary McMichael, helped to silence the guns on the streets and to bring about the first peace in a generation. But most of all, America salutes all the people of Northern Ireland who have shown the world in concrete ways that here the will for peace is now stronger than the weapons of war. With mixed sporting events encouraging competition on the playing field, not the battlefield; with women's support groups, literacy programs, job training centers that served both communities--these and countless other initiatives bolster the foundations of peace as well. Last year's cease-fire of the Irish Republican Army, joined by the combined Loyalist Military Command, marked a turning point in the history of Northern Ireland. Now is the time to sustain that momentum and lock in the gains of peace. Neither community wants to go back to the violence of the past. The children told of that today. Both parties must do their part to move this process forward now. Let me begin by saying that the search for common ground demands the courage of an open mind. This twin-track initiative gives the parties a chance to begin preliminary talks in ways in which all views will be represented and all voices will be heard. It also establishes an international body to address the issue of arms decommissioning. I hope the parties will seize this opportunity. Engaging in honest dialogue is not an act of surrender, it is an act of strength and common sense. (Applause.) Moving from cease-fire to peace requires dialogue. For 25 years now the history of Northern Ireland has been written in the blood of its children and their parents. The cease-fire turned the page on that history; it must not be allowed to turn back. (Applause.) There must also be progress away from the negotiating table. Violence has lessened, but it has not disappeared. The leaders of the four main churches recently condemned the so- called punishment beatings and called for an end to such attacks. I add my voice to theirs. (Applause.) As the church leaders said, this is a time when the utmost efforts on all sides are needed to build a peaceful and confident community in the future. But true peace requires more than a treaty, even more than the absence of violence. Those who have suffered most in the fighting must share fairly in the fruits of renewal. The frustration that gave rise to violence must give way to faith in the future. The United States will help to secure the tangible benefits of peace. Ours is the first American administration ever to support in the Congress the International Fund for Ireland, which has become an engine for economic development and for reconciliation. We will continue to encourage trade and investment and to help end the cycle of unemployment. We are proud to support Northern Ireland. You have given America a very great deal. Irish Protestant and Irish Catholic together have added to America's strength. From our battle for independence down to the present day, the Irish have not only fought in our wars, they have built our nation, and we owe you a very great debt. (Applause.) Let me say that of all the gifts we can offer in return, perhaps the most enduring and the most precious is the example of what is possible when people find unity and strength in their diversity. We know from our own experience even today how hard that is to do. After all, we fought a great Civil War over the issue of race and slavery in which hundreds of thousands of our people were killed. Today, in one of our counties alone, in Los Angeles, there are over 150 different ethnic and racial groups represented. We know we can become stronger if we bridge our differences. But we learned in our own Civil War that that has to begin with a change of the heart. I grew up in the American South, in one of the states that tried to break from the American Union. My forebears on my father's side were soldiers in the Confederate Army. I was reading the other day a book about our first governor after the Civil War who fought for the Union Army, and who lost members of his own family. They lived the experience so many of you have lived. When this governor took office and looked out over a sea of his fellow citizens who fought on the other side, he said these words: ``We have all done wrong. No one can say his heart is altogether clean and his hands altogether pure. Thus, as we wish to be forgiven, let us forgive those who have sinned against us and ours.'' That was the beginning of America's reconciliation, and it must be the beginning of Northern Ireland's reconciliation. (Applause.) It is so much easier to believe that our differences matter more than what we have in common. It is easier, but it is wrong. We all cherish family and faith, work and community. We all strive to live lives that are free and honest and responsible. We all want our children to grow up in a world where their talents are matched by their opportunities. And I believe those values are just as strong in County Londonderry as they are in Londonderry, New Hampshire; in Belfast, Northern Ireland as in Belfast, Maine. I am proud to be of Ulster Scots stock. I am proud to be, also, of Irish stock. I share these roots with millions and millions of Americans, now over 40 million Americans. And we rejoice at things being various, as Louis MacNeice once wrote. It is one of the things that makes America special. Because our greatness flows from the wealth of our diversity as well as the strength of the ideals we share in common, we feel bound to support others around the world who seek to bridge their own divides. This is an important part of our country's mission on the eve of the 21st century, because we know that the chain of peace that protects us grows stronger with every new link that is forged. For the first time in half a century now, we can put our children to bed at night knowing that the nuclear weapons of the former Soviet Union are no longer pointed at those children. In South Africa, the long night of apartheid has given way to a new freedom for all peoples. In the Middle East, Arabs and Israelis are stepping beyond war to peace in an area where many believed peace would never come. In Haiti, a brutal dictatorship has given way to a fragile new democracy. In Europe, the dream of a stable, undivided free continent seems finally within reach as the people of Bosnia have the first real hope for peace since the terrible fighting began there nearly four years ago. The United States looks forward to working with our allies here in Europe and others to help the people in Bosnia--the Muslims, the Croats, the Serbs--to move beyond their divisions and their destructions to make the peace agreement they have made a reality in the lives of their people. Those who work for peace have got to support one another. We know that when leaders stand up for peace, they place their forces on the line, and sometimes their very lives on the line, as we learned so recently in the tragic murder of the brave Prime Minister of Israel. For, just as peace has its pioneers, peace will always have its rivals. Even when children stand up and say what these children said today, there will always be people who, deep down inside, will never be able to give up the past. Over the last three years I have had the privilege of meeting with and closely listening to both Nationalists and Unionists from Northern Ireland, and I believe that the greatest struggle you face now is not between opposing ideas or opposing interests. The greatest struggle you face is between those who, deep down inside, are inclined to be peacemakers, and those who, deep down inside, cannot yet embrace the cause of peace. Between those who are in the ship of peace and those who are trying to sink it, old habits die hard. There will always be those who define the worth of their lives not by who they are, but by who they aren't; not [[Page S 18092]] by what they're for, but by what they are against. They will never escape the dead-end street of violence. But you, the vast majority, Protestant and Catholic alike, must not allow the ship of peace to sink on the rocks of old habits and hard grudges. (Applause.) You must stand firm against terror. You must say to those who still would use violence for political objectives--you are the past; your day is over. Violence has no place at the table of democracy, and no role in the future of this land. By the same token, you must also be willing to say to those who renounce violence and who do take their own risks for peace that they are entitled to be full participants in the democratic process. Those who show the courage--(applause)-- those who do show the courage to break with the past are entitled to their stake in the future. As leaders for peace become invested in the process, as leaders make compromises and risk the backlash, people begin more and more--I have seen this all over the world--they begin more and more to develop a common interest in each other's success; in standing together rather than standing apart. They realize that the sooner they get to true peace, with all the rewards it brings, the sooner it will be easy to discredit and destroy the forces of destruction. We will stand with those who take risks for peace, in Northern Ireland and around the world. I pledge that we will do all we can, through the International Fund for Ireland and in many other ways, to ease your load. If you walk down this path continually, you will not walk alone. We are entering an era of possibility unparalleled in all of human history. If you enter that era determined to build a new age of peace, the United States of America will proudly stand with you. (Applause.) But at the end of the day, as with all free people, your future is for you to decide. Your destiny is for you to determine. Only you can decide between division and unity, between hard lives and high hopes. Only you can create a lasting peace. It takes courage to let go of familiar divisions. It takes faith to walk down a new road. But when we see the bright gaze of these children, we know the risk is worth the reward. I have been so touched by the thousands of letters I have received from schoolchildren here, telling me what peace means to them. One young girl from Ballymena wrote--and I quote--``It is not easy to forgive and forget, especially for those who have lost a family member or a close friend. However, if people could look to the future with hope instead of the past with fear, we can only be moving in the right direction.'' I couldn't have said it nearly as well. I believe you can summon the strength to keep moving forward. After all, you have come so far already. You have braved so many dangers, you have endured so many sacrifices. Surely, there can be no turning back. But peace must be waged with a warrior's resolve--bravely, proudly, and relentlessly--secure in the knowledge of the single, greatest difference between war and peace: In peace, everybody can win. (Applause.) I was overcome today when I landed in my plane and I drove with Hillary up the highway to come here by the phenomenal beauty of the place and the spirit and the goodwill of the people. Northern Ireland has a chance not only to begin anew, but to be a real inspiration to the rest of the world, a model of progress through tolerance. Let us join our efforts together as never before to make that dream a reality. Let us join our prayers in this season of peace for a future of peace in this good land. Thank you very much. (Applause.) \": 'target_text',\n",
       " \"SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER CALLS FOR U.N. REFORM Mr. PELL. Mr. President, yesterday Secretary of State Warren Christopher delivered an important address to the U.N. General Assembly. Secretary Christopher's speech, which was made at the initiation of the 50th session of the General Assembly, was remarkable not only for the milestone it commemorated, but for the forward- thinking approach it took to the issue of U.N. reform. Recent congressional debates have demonstrated that continued U.S. support for the United Nations hinges on the issue of reform. At a time when some members of Congress are questioning the fundamental utility of U.S. participation in the United Nations, it is imperative that the U.N. perform its duties effectively and in a cost-efficient manner. As Secretary Christopher said last night, It is time to recognize that the UN must direct its limited resources to the world's highest priorities, focusing on the tasks that it performs best. The UN's bureaucracy should be smaller, with a clear organizational structure and sharp lines of responsibility. Each program must be held to a simple standard--that is, it must make a tangible contribution to the freedom, security, and well-being of real people in the real world. Mr. President, as one who was present at the creation of the United Nations, I have tried very hard to see the U.N. live up to its potential and have seen the good works of which it is capable. I underscore and applaud the Secretary of State's call for reform. His initiative has my full support, and I hope it will receive the support of the Congress as well. The very future of the United Nations, and the success of many of our own national security objectives, depend upon it. Mr. President, I commend the Secretary's address to my colleagues and ask unanimous consent that the full text of his remarks be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. Department of State, Office of the Spokesman, New York, NY, September 25, 1995. Remarks by Secretary of State Warren Christopher to the 50th Session of the United Nations General Assembly Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Excellencies, Distinguished Guests: It is a privilege to speak to you today on behalf of the United States. A half-century ago, the General Assembly first met in New York--across the river in a converted skating rink at Flushing Meadows. In those modest surroundings, our predecessors began to put into place an ambitious framework they hoped would keep the peace as successfully as they had prosecuted the war. In the years since, the United Nations has helped to bring peace, prosperity and hope to countless people around the world. Technological change has brought nations closer together than the UN's founders could possibly have foreseen. The United Nations itself has been challenged in unforeseen ways. It has had to manage complex humanitarian emergencies, from civil wars to the mass movement of refugees to health epidemics. This evolution has placed great strains on the organization, and revealed the necessity for far-reaching change in how it is run. The Clinton Administration has vigorously made the case to our Congress and our people for continued American leadership at the UN. The United States made a commitment to the UN Charter 50 years ago. We are determined to keep our commitment, including our financial obligations. We will always remember that for millions of people around the world, the UN is far from a faceless institution: It is, as Harry Truman once said, ``a case of food or a box of school books; it is a doctor who vaccinates their children; it is an expert who shows them how to raise more rice, or more wheat.'' To millions more, it is the difference between peace and war. Economic and social development, as well as protection of human rights, remain central to the UN's mission. But the UN must change to meet these needs more effectively. When money is wasted in New York, Geneva, or Vienna, and when time is lost to bureaucratic inertia, the people who pay the price are those most vulnerable to famine, disease and violence. It is time to recognize that the UN must direct its limited resources to the world's highest priorities, focusing on the tasks that it performs best. The UN's bureaucracy should be smaller, with a clear organizational structure and sharp lines of responsibility. Each program must be held to a simple standard--that is, it must make a tangible contribution to the freedom, security, and well-being of real people in the real world. In the last two years, under the leadership of Secretary- General Boutros-Ghali, the groundwork for substantial change has been laid. The UN has an office with the functions of an inspector general, and a mandate to crack down on waste and fraud. Under-Secretary-General Joe Connor has embarked on an aggressive campaign to improve the UN's management culture, and we fully support his work. The UN Secretariat has moved in the right direction by submitting a budget that begins to restrain spending. Now the momentum for reform must accelerate. Let me propose a concrete agenda: First, we must end UN programs that have achieved their purpose, and consolidate programs that overlap, especially in the economic and social agencies. The UN has more than a dozen organizations responsible for development, emergency response, and statistical reporting. We should consider establishing a single agency for each of these functions. We should downsize the UN's regional economic commissions. We should ensure that the functions of the UN Conference on Trade and Development do not duplicate the new WTO. And we should adopt a moratorium on big UN conferences once the present series is completed, concentrating instead on meeting the commitments of those we have held. Second, we need to streamline the UN Secretariat to make it more efficient, accountable and transparent. Each part of the UN system should be subject to the scrutiny of an inspector general. The UN must not tolerate ethical or financial abuses and its managers should be appointed and promoted on the basis of merit. Third, we should rigorously scrutinize proposals for new and extended peacekeeping missions, and we should improve the UN's ability to respond rapidly when new missions are approved. We must agree on an equitable scale of peacekeeping assessments that reflects today's economic realities. And we should have a unified budget for peacekeeping operations. Finally, we must maintain the effectiveness of the Security Council. Germany and Japan should become permanent members. We should ensure that all the world's regions are fairly represented, without making the Council unwieldy. We welcome the formation of the high-level group on reform, initiated under the leadership of outgoing General Assembly President Essy. Our goal must be that a practical blueprint for UN reform will be adopted before the General Assembly's 50th Session finishes work next fall. The way forward is clear: We have already seen countless [[Page S 14280]] studies and reports. The time has come to act on the best proposals. As you know, in my country there have been serious efforts to curtail our support for the United Nations. The Clinton Administration believes it would be reckless to turn away from an organization that helps mobilize the support of other nations for goals that are consistent with American and global interests. But to sustain support for the UN among the American people and the people of other nations, it is not enough that we defend the institution. The best argument against retreat is further reform. Tangible progress will help us win the battle for UN support that we are waging in the United States. The United Nations must emerge from the reform process better able to meet its fundamental goals, including the preservation of peace and security. From Korea, to the Persian Gulf, to Haiti, the UN has provided a mandate to its members as they carried out this responsibility. The UN's own blue helmets have helped nations create the basic conditions of peace in some of the most difficult situations imaginable, even though they have not always fully achieved their intended purpose. Recently, a young Haitian father was asked what peacekeeping forces had achieved in his country. ``We walk freely,'' he answered. ``We sleep quietly. There are no men who come for us in the night.'' In Haiti, as for example in Cambodia, Mozambique and El Salvador, the UN has shown that peacekeeping, for all of its limitations, has been an enormously useful instrument. Our region where UN forces and the international community have played a critical role is the Middle East. Another historic milestone will be marked this Thursday in Washington when Israel and the Palestinians sign their agreement to implement phase two of the Declaration of Principles. That agreement will bring to life a goal first set in the Camp David accords--that is, to protect Israel's security and to give Palestinians throughout the West Bank control over their daily lives. The international community and the UN must continue to support this process politically and economically. Without a doubt, the UN has never undertaken a mission more difficult than the one in the former Yugoslavia. The limitations of that mission are well known. But we must also recognize that it has provided relief for hundreds of thousands of people and saved thousands of lives. Today, with diplomacy backed by force, the United States and the international community are moving forward on a track that is producing genuinely hopeful results. The United Nations and NATO are working together effectively to bring peace to the region. On September 8 in Geneva, the parties to the conflict accepted the fundamental goal the Security Council has often expressed--namely, the continuation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a single state within its current internationally recognized borders. When I meet with the foreign ministers of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia later today, I will urge them to maintain momentum toward peace and to establish constitutional structures for Bosnia. The framers of the UN Charter created this institution to meet threats to peace and security posed by aggression and armed conflict. These threats are still very much with us. But the world also faces a set of new security challenges, including proliferation, terrorism, international crime and narcotics, as well as the far-reaching consequences of damage to the environment. These have assumed a new and dangerous scope in a more interdependent world. As President Clinton said in San Francisco in June, the ``new forces of integration carry within them the seeds of disintegration and destruction.'' While new technologies have brought us closer together, they have also made it easier for terrorists, drug dealers, and other international criminals to acquire weapons of mass destruction, to set up cocaine cartels, and to hide their ill-gotten gains. The collapse of communism has shattered dictatorships. But it has also left the political and legal institutions of newly liberated nations even more vulnerable to those who seek to subvert them. Although these threats are sometimes sponsored by states, they increasingly follow no flag. Each of us must vigorously fight these enemies on our own. But we will never be truly secure until we effectively fight them together. That is the new security challenge for the global community. It must be the new security mission of the UN. There is no area where the UN can make a more significant contribution than in nonproliferation. Fifty years ago, the United States was the only country capable of making a nuclear bomb. Today, many countries have the technology that would enable them to turn a fist-sized chunk of plutonium into a bomb as small as a suitcase. That is one reason why more than 170 countries agreed to extend for all time the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty last May, at the conference chaired here by Ambassador Dhanapala. We must build on that achievement. First, we should have a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ready for signature by the time we meet here next year. As President Clinton announced last moth, the United States is committed to a true zero-yield test ban. We urge other nations to join us in that commitment. Second, we should immediately start negotiations on a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty. Those who have been most vocal in calling for nuclear disarmament should recognize that it is essential to ban future production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. Third, we should push forward with the historic reductions of the nuclear arsenals of the United States and the countries of the former Soviet Union. I call on the U.S. Senate, as well as the Russian Duma, to approve the START II Treaty so that we can lock in deep cuts in our strategic nuclear arsenals. In addition, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin are working together to ensure the safety, transparency and irreversibility of nuclear arms reductions. As part of this process, President Yeltsin will host a Nuclear Safety and Security Summit in Moscow next spring. The Summit should have an ambitious agenda, including a declaration of principles on nuclear reactor safety. We look to the summit to address the worldwide problem of nuclear waste management, including ocean dumping. The Summit should also promote a plan of action to Safeguard nuclear materials. That plan should include new measures to prevent criminals and terrorists from acquiring nuclear material for use in weapons. Finally, we should push for the earliest possible entry- into-force of the Chemical Weapons Convention. President Clinton has urged the U.S. Senate to act promptly on its ratification, and to stop holding it and the START II treaty hostage to unrelated issues. The world has witnessed the effect of poison gas too many times in this century--on European battlefields during World War I, in Ethiopia and Manchuria during the 1930s, and against Iranian soldiers and innocent Kurdish civilians in the 1980s. The Chemical Weapons Convention will make every nation safer, and we need it now. The UN is also playing an invaluable role in focusing attention on pressing regional poliferation problems. In Iraq UNSCOM and its chairman Rolf Ekeus continue to uncover horrific details about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. Under Saddam Hussein, Iraq developed a deadly biological weapons capacity hidden from view. It was conducting research to turn some of the most toxic substances known to man into weapons of war. We know Saddam succeeded in putting anthrax and botulism in bombs and missile warheads. In December 1990, he deployed these with every intent to using them against the international coalition and innocent civilians. He was dissuaded only by the steadfast determination of the United States and the international community. In light of what Ambassador Ekeus has uncovered, we can only conclude that for the last four and a half years Saddam Hussein has lied about the full scope of Iraq's weapons programs. There should be no easing of the sanctions regime until the Iraqi government complies with all the demands of the Security Council and demonstrates that it has changed its ways. The UN should also promote responsibility and restraint in the transfer of conventional weapons. Last year at the General Assembly, President Clinton proposed, and the Assembly approved, the eventual elimination of antipersonnel landmines. On my recent trip to Cambodia, I saw the terrible damage these hidden killers can do. This year, we will again call on other countries to join us in ending the export of landmines. Two years ago, President Clinton called on the international community to devise a true international system that governs transfers of conventional weapons and sensitive dual-use technologies. I am pleased that the Russian Federation has joined with the United States and 26 other countries to agree on common principles to control the build- up of dangerous conventional arms. We hope to activate this global regime, called the New Forum, by the end of this year. The proliferation of weapons has added a disturbing dimension to another threat we all face: international terrorism. Indeed, this year's sarin gas attack in Tokyo is a grim warning of what can happen when terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction. More nations are joining the fight against those individuals and groups who attack civilians for political ends. The United Nations has supported this effort in important ways. The UN Security Council recognized the importance of countering state-sponsored terrorism by imposing sanctions against Libya for the bombing of Pan Am 103 and UTA 772. Terrorists should be treated as criminals and there must be no place where they can hide from the consequences of their acts. States that sponsor terrorists should feel the full weight of sanctions that can be imposed by the international community. Let us not deceive ourselves: Every dollar that goes into the government coffers of a state sponsor of terrorism such as Iran helps pay for a terrorist's bullets or bombs. Iran's role as the foremost state sponsor of terrorism makes its secret quest for weapons of mass destruction even more alarming. We must stand together to prevent Iran from acquiring such threatening capabilities. The United States has taken a leading role in meeting the international terrorist threat. We have intensified our sanctions against Iran. Last January, President Clinton also issued an Executive Order prohibiting financial transactions with terrorist groups and individuals who threaten the Middle East peace process. We are urging our Congress to tighten our immigration and criminal laws to keep terrorists on the run or put them behind bars. The United States strongly supports the counter-terrorism measures the G-7 and Russia announced at the Halifax Summit, and [[Page S 14281]] we expect the P-8 Ministerial Meeting on Terrorism in Ottawa to produce a concrete action plan to implement these measures. Other kinds of international crime also threaten the safety of our citizens and the fabric of our societies. And globalization brings new and frightening dimensions to crime. The threat of crime is a particular menace to young democracies. It weakens confidence in institutions, preys on the most vulnerable, and undermines free market reform. Of course, every country must take its own measures to combat these threats. The Clinton Administration is now completing a review of our approach to transnational crime that will lead to a stronger, more coordinated attack on this problem. To help other states deal with criminal threats, the United States and Hungary have created the International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest to train police officers and law enforcement officials from Central Europe and the states of the former Soviet Union. We are providing similar help bilaterally and through the UN Drug Control Program to countries whose laws are challenged by drug cartels. A particularly insidious form of crime and corruption is money laundering. All nations should implement recommendations by the OECD to attack money laundering. The nations of this hemisphere should also advance the anti-money laundering initiative introduced at last December's Summit of the Americas. Together, we must squeeze the dirty money out of our global financial system. Through the UN's conventions on drugs and crime, the international community has set strong standards that we must now enforce. We call on UN member states who have not already joined the 1988 UN Drug Convention to do so. Those countries who have approved the convention should move quickly to implement its key provisions. We are increasingly aware that damage to the environment and unsustainable population growth threaten the security of our nations and the well-being of our peoples. Their harmful effects are evident in famines, infant mortality rates, refugee crises, and ozone depletion. In places like Rwanda and Somalia, they contribute to civil wars and emergencies that can only be resolved by costly international intervention. We must carry out the commitments we made at last year's Cairo Conference, and the Rio Conference three years ago. Never have our problems been more complex. It has never been more evident that these problems affect all nations, developed and developing, alike. Only by working together can we effectively deal with the new threats we all face. That is why, on this 50th anniversary year, we must shape the UN's agenda as if we were creating the institution anew. Just as the UN's founders devised a new framework to deter aggression and armed conflict, the United Nations, in particular the Security Council, must now assign the same priority to combating the threat posed by proliferation, terrorism, international crime, narcotics, and environmental pollution. We should dedicate our efforts in the UN and elsewhere to turning our global consensus against these threats into concrete action. We must renew and reform the United Nations not for its sake, but for our own. Thank you very much. Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. \": 'target_text',\n",
       " \"SENDING UNITED STATES TROOPS TO BOSNIA Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wanted to speak this morning in response to President Clinton's address to the Nation last night regarding the sending of American troops to Bosnia. I think the President made a strong case for support for his position, but I do not think that he made a strong enough case to justify sending American ground troops to Bosnia. I would like to address that point this morning because, obviously, in the Senate and in the House we are going to begin a debate which could last a couple of weeks here. After there are hearings, after there are briefings, presumably we will be voting on the issue, and I think it is important for us to begin to lay out the various issues, to get response from the American people, to discuss the matter among ourselves, and then be able to make an informed judgment. I would note that in checking this morning I found that since we began keeping track of it in my office, we have received 400 calls against sending American troops to Bosnia and 6 calls in favor. And I spent a fair amount of time during the Thanksgiving recess speaking with groups in Arizona and appearing on various radio programs. In each case, the response was similar to the one which I just indicated. That is not dispositive, but I think it is an important indicator of the fact that the American people do not sense there is a sufficient degree of interest here for the United States to participate. It seems to me there are two basic criteria which need to be satisfied in order to justify the sending of a large number of American ground troops into a situation where, as the President and the Secretary of Defense have both acknowledged, there is certainly a danger of some casualties. The first criterion which has traditionally been applied is that there is a national security interest of the United States at stake. Sometimes it has been expressed as a vital national security interest. The second is more operational. It generally divides into about three subcategories: that there is a very clear and important mission; that the rules of engagement are clear and [[Page S 17542]] agreed to; and that there is a clear exit strategy. Let us talk about both of those in the context of the President's remarks last night. I did not really hear a justification for the first point, that is to say, that there is a vital U.S. national security interest involved here. I heard some talk about the fact that it was important for the United States as a key participant in NATO to be involved in NATO operations, and I also heard that we wanted to prevent conflict from spreading throughout Europe. Both of those have a national security element to them, but neither goes directly to the question of vital U.S. national security interests. If, for example, someone could make the case that war in Europe was about to break out, while American lives may not be directly in jeopardy, I think few of us would deny that vital interests of the United States would be at stake sufficient for us to commit to not only ground troops but other kinds of military operations to try to prevent that. But that case is not made here. The possibility that there will be some additional civil strife in Bosnia does not suggest the conflict is going to engulf Europe. The situation is very different than it was before World War I. The Austro- Hungarian Empire no longer exists. The conditions are simply not the same. So it seems to me a real stretch to say there may be some additional conflict break out, that that would necessarily engulf Europe in war and therefore at this point the United States needs to send these troops in order to conclude that. That is just not a credible argument. As to the argument about NATO, it seems to me that either NATO is a strong alliance or it is not. I believe it is a strong alliance. If the President is suggesting that the difference between NATO continuing to exist as a strong alliance and its complete failure is whether or not 20,000 of the 60,000 ground troops in this operation are U.S. troops, if that is the difference between NATO existing and not existing, then NATO is in much worse shape than I thought it was, and I think, frankly, it just is not true. NATO is strong. And since we are providing a great deal of the support for the existing NATO operation, and will continue to do so under this peace process which has been negotiated, in terms of the seapower that we have projected, the airpower, the reconnaissance, the intelligence, obviously, monetary support that we will be providing and material support and a lot of other things, since we have been doing those things and will continue to do them as part of the NATO operation, it does not seem to me that we are subject to criticism that we are not supporting the NATO operation. It is just a question of whether some of the ground troops are going to be U.S. troops or not. My understanding is that the British and French and perhaps others in NATO insisted that part of the ground contingent be United States troops. That is not a justification for saying that therefore we must go. I would have to ask our allies, why? Why is it that you insist that not only do we pay for most of the operation and that we send our ships and our cargo planes and our jet fighters and reconnaissance planes, and all of the other equipment and personnel that we have in the region, in addition to all of that, a necessary component of this is that 20,000 of the 60,000 ground troops be U.S. troops? Why is that so essential? Is it because the Europeans do not have another 20,000 troops? No. That is not it. It is because they want us to be in the operation on the ground. And my question there is, why? Why is it that that is so essential? If this matter is so important to the Europeans, then it seems to me that they would pull out all of the stops to enforce this peace settlement including providing the necessary ground troops to make it work. And surely among all of the NATO countries there are 60,000 ground troops available. So one has to answer the question I think, why do our Europeans allies insist on this? I cannot think of a satisfactory answer. So back to the first criterion. Is there a vital U.S. national security interest? The answer is no, and the President has not made the case for it. Let me contrast this with the Persian Gulf war because a lot of people have tried to say that, like the Persian Gulf war, we need to follow the lead of the President and accede to his request for ground troops. The Persian Gulf war and this situation, it seems to me, are relatively close cases, both of them, but one falls on the side of supporting the operation and the other falls on the side of not supporting it. And here is why. Let us say on a scale of 1 to 10, vital national security interest being 10, Pearl Harbor created a vital national security interest for the United States to be involved in World War II. No question. That is a 10. The Persian Gulf war was a situation in which most of our oil, a majority of our oil, came from the Persian Gulf. Its supplies were threatened. A foreign country had invaded another country, was occupying it and was threatening to invade other countries. At that point, it was important for the world community to come together and say to this aggressor, ``No. Aggression will not pay. We will remove you from Kuwait, take you back to where you came from. You have got to stop threatening all the people whose oil supplies come from that region.'' That is not the same as Pearl Harbor, but clearly vital U.S. interests were involved. And, in fact, worldwide, countries came together, even other Arab countries came together, in an effort to stop that aggression. And I guess on a scale of 1 to 10, I would say that is a 6 or 7. As I said, that is a much closer call than a Pearl Harbor, but still justified our action. And a majority of our people and the Congress supported President Bush's decision to engage in military operations against Iraq. This case in Bosnia, I submit, falls on the other side of the line, if you want to say five is the middle ground. It seems to me there is only one reason why it rises to the level of maybe a three or four. That is the moral imperative. Now, a moral imperative is not the same thing as a vital national security interest of the United States, but in certain instances it may call upon the United States to do something. That is why the United States has been involved in various humanitarian missions. It is why we went into Somalia with a humanitarian mission to begin with. It is why we were not justified in changing that mission as it later was changed. The United States has done lots of things for a lot of people around the world in a humanitarian way for moral reasons. In addition to the humanitarian support that we provided, we also have supported some military operations in support of the humanitarian effort. But that is different from saying that in addition to air operations and sea operations and humanitarian operations and peacekeeping operations, in addition to all those things the United States must send 20,000 ground troops to keep the peace that has been negotiated at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. So, yes, there is a moral imperative. That is what makes this a relatively hard case. But it does not rise to the level of a vital national security interest. It says that we ought to be doing something. And we are doing something, and we will continue to do more. I submit that the one thing that we should have been doing a long time ago is still missing from this peace agreement, and that is ensuring that Bosnia can defend itself. For a long time many of us in this body have argued for arming the Bosnians, the Bosnian Moslems, so they can defend themselves. We always believed that a rough parity would eventually be created sufficient to cause the Serbs to come to the bargaining table. What happened when Croatia, after about 3 years, was able to build up its military forces sufficient to retake some of the territory that the Serbs had taken from them? At that point, the Serbs became defensive rather than offensive in their military operations. They also came to the bargaining table because they understood that it was a losing game for them, that the longer they persisted, the more territory likely would be taken from them. So a military balance of forces of some sort was, in fact, created. That is what we have sought when we said we needed to lift the arms embargo and support rearming the Bosnian Moslems so they could defend themselves. And [[Page S 17543]] yet that commitment is not part of this particular peace agreement. So it seems to me that the one thing that we could do in this situation we have not done in this particular peace agreement. Turning for a moment from the vital national security interest, let us go to the other part of the equation, the second part. The mission has not been clearly defined. The rules of engagement have not yet been established. And, third, there is no exit strategy. Tony Lake, the National Security Adviser, was quoted in the newspapers yesterday--I think he made the statement Sunday--that our first mission is self- defense. Mr. President, the way you fulfill that mission is by not sending the people in the first place. That is not a mission. That is very muddled thinking to suggest that our first mission there is self-defense. The mission has to be stated much more clearly, and it has not been, nor have the various contingencies been defined. What happens if various kinds of military conflicts break out? We have not decided how we are going to handle those things. And that has to do also with the rules of engagement. They have been only very generally stated up to this point. As my colleague, Senator McCain, has pointed out, what is really glaringly missing is any kind of an exit strategy. A 1-year timetable is not an exit strategy. What is to prevent mission creep, and what is to define success of the mission? Most observers have said for this peacekeeping mission to really succeed, it is going to have to be a commitment of years, perhaps decades. And that gets to the next point, Mr. President. Perhaps the primary justification that the President has given for sending American ground troops to Bosnia is that if we do not do so, the war will reignite and there will be additional suffering. In other words, if you believe in war, you vote no; if you believe in peace, you vote yes. That is a false choice, Mr. President. That is a false choice. If this peace that has been negotiated is so fragile, if it is so fragile that the only thing between peace and war is that of the 60,000 ground troops, and 20,000 have to be Americans, then this is a peace which is bound to fail. It is not a peace of the heart. It is not a peace that has been committed to by the belligerents, but rather a convenience that has probably been forced upon the parties and is probably doomed to, if not failure, at least a very rocky road, which means a lot of casualties on the part of the peacekeepers. And that is a situation we need to take into account before we support the President's decision to send the troops. What is it that makes the 20,000 American ground force contingent sine qua non, to use that Latin phrase, that without which this peace agreement cannot succeed? We are already providing sea power and air power and reconnaissance and intelligence and humanitarian assistance, diplomatic assistance, monetary assistance. The President has committed to some additional monetary assistance. We are already providing a lot of things to promote peace in the region. Our European allies have said we need a ground contingent of 60,000. They are willing to support that with 40,000. What is it that makes the additional 20,000 required to be American troops? Why cannot they be European? Is the President saying that if all 60,000 are European, the agreement will fail? That is what he said in effect. What is the magic of 20,000 of those being American? ``Well, America has prestige, and American prestige is necessary to enforce this agreement.'' American prestige will be demonstrated every time a U.S. fighter jet passes overhead. It will be demonstrated every time you look out to sea and see one of our carriers or destroyers cruising in the Adriatic. It will be present with the diplomatic presence of the United States, the power of the U.S. Presidency and our support for NATO, and demonstrated in 100 ways. What is it that is so magical about one-third of the ground troops being American? Sure, that will demonstrate an additional presence, but is it absolutely essential? It is the difference between war and peace, the President says. If it is--and I doubt that it is--but if it is, then this peace is too fragile, in the first place. We already have signs that that is true with some of the Serb leaders saying in effect, no, never, that blood will be spilled, that they are not going to go along with this. So, if the basic criterion, as the President laid out, was that there would be peace, and we would simply be implementing the peace, one questions whether that condition will even exist when our troops hit the ground over there, if they do. There has been another justification, and I think that this is perhaps one of the most difficult for us to deal with because all of us support, not only the President, but the office of the Presidency. We generally try to defer to the President and the executive branch in foreign policy matters to a large extent, anyway. But the Senate has certain constitutional prerogatives. We have the advice-and-consent prerogative. We have the ability to ratify treaties, and so on. The President, in effect, has invited the Congress to decide whether or not to support his action or not. So I do not think there is any question that we need to make an independent judgment here of whether or not the sending of these troops is a good idea. But the argument of the President in this regard goes something as follows. Up until the time that the agreement in Dayton was initialed, we were not supposed to debate the issue because, after all, there was not anything to debate. We had not decided what to do. Well, the reality was the President had already committed to send the 20,000 troops, but we were not supposed to debate that because the agreement was not clear yet. So we did not. We basically deferred. There were many of us here, myself included, who wanted to speak much more specifically about it, to ask a lot of questions, and perhaps to lay down some conditions for the peace agreement, but we did not do that out of deference to the President. But now the argument goes, once the agreement was initialed, ``You would be pulling the rug out from under the Presidency, indeed from under U.S. foreign policy, if you did not approve my commitment to send 20,000 American troops.'' That is a catch-22, Mr. President. You cannot argue about it before the treaty is initialed and as soon as it is initialed, it is too late to argue about it. So when are we going to have the debate as to whether or not this is good policy? It is true, if the Congress turned its back on the President at this point, there would be some embarrassment to the United States. The question we have to ask ourselves is: Is the risk of casualties and is the precedent which is being set to send these troops outweighed by some temporary embarrassment to the United States? I submit at this point, at least I have concluded that the answer to that is no, that the Congress has to make it clear to the President that he cannot simply go around making premature commitments without the advice and consent of the Congress, commitments which some of us believe not to be wise, and then justifying the support for that on the basis that the commitment was made and, therefore, cannot be questioned anymore. Either you consult with the Congress in advance and have some sense that you have the support of the Congress and the American people and then argue, once the commitment is made, that it is too late to argue about it, or at least I think you have been estopped, to use a legal phrase, to argue there should not be a robust debate about it after the decision has been made. My point is, there is no argument to say, ``I made the commitment to send the troops and now it would be embarrassing to the United States, it would diminish the leadership role of our country if I were not backed up in that commitment,'' to use the President's argument. My point is very simple. The President should have thought of that before he made the commitment. He made a commitment, and I think at this point we have to debate it. The bottom line is this: The President has not demonstrated a vital national security interest of the United States involved, nor has there been a [[Page S 17544]] clear delineation of the operational aspects, its mission, the rules of engagement, and the exit strategy. Until those cases are made, I think the President is asking too much of us to commit U.S. ground troops to this operation. Therefore, Mr. President, it would be my hope that after we have had a full debate, after there have been hearings, after there have been briefings by the administration, and after we have had an opportunity to consider within this body and the House has had an opportunity to consider it, that we would have a vote on the matter; that we be able to express ourselves either to support the President's request or to reject it. At this point, my own view is that we reject it. I invite any debate and any rationale that can be expressed in support of the President's position. As I said, at this point, I think it is far too serious a matter for the United States Congress to support the President's request that 20,000 ground troops be sent to Bosnia, in addition to all the other things which we have already done and which we continue to do. I close with this point. Nobody wants this tragedy to continue. Everybody wants peace to succeed. We all commend the President and those who negotiated on his behalf for this peace agreement, and I would want to do everything we could to support that agreement, short of the commitment of these ground troops. They are not the necessary ingredient to make it work. If they were, it would be destined to fail. Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

       " \"DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996 The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill. Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the pending amendment aside. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 2840 (Purpose: To provide funding for the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration for implementing certain recommendations and for carrying out a transition) Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan], for himself, Mr. Burns, Mr. Hollings, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Graham, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Reid, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Thurmond, proposes an amendment numbered 2840. Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: At the appropriate place, insert the following: United States Travel and Tourism Administration salaries and expenses For necessary expenses of the United States Travel and Tourism Administration, for implementing the recommendations from the White House Conference on Travel and Tourism and for carrying out the transition of that Administration into a public-private partnership, $12,000,000, to be transferred from the amount for deposit in the Commerce Reorganization Transition Fund (established under section 206(c)(1) of this title) that is made available in the item under the heading ``commerce reorganization transition fund'' under the heading ``General Administration'' under this title, notwithstanding any other provision of law. Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to report the floor manager has indicated that this amendment will be accepted. I want to acknowledge the support of the distinguished Senator from Montana, who has been most helpful in working through this amendment. I yield the floor, if I may, to him. I made remarks earlier this morning. This deals with the USTTA. The distinguished floor managers have accommodated that. I yield to the Senator from Montana. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana. Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nevada. I do not think there is anybody on the Commerce Committee who is any more dedicated to the health of the industry we call tourism. If the American people would look around, this happens to be one part of the Commerce Department that produces an export that is $20 billion to this country in the black--not in the red. In fact, if it was not for agriculture and tourism, our balance of payments would look really bad. But when any industry produces around $77 billion in foreign exchange earnings every year, we have to take note, especially since this country probably makes less investment in this part of our national economy than any other part. Mr. President, 7.7 million people visited our State of Montana. Sometimes [[Page S 14631]] we think we are pretty authentic, but I also understand where the Senator from Nevada is coming from, too, because they have a very active tourism part of their State government and he has been supportive of that. If this amendment is accepted, it is only an increase of around $5 million, because there is already $7 million of transition funds in there. Also, the plans and preparations are being made to privatize this department because the tourism industry wants to put together the funds. They think they can do a better job in establishing this commission than the Government can, and we agree with them. But let us give them the time, some funds, and a transition period and let them do it. Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as a former Governor of Florida, where the tourism industry is the State's largest employer, I am amazed at the fact that an industry with such tremendous economic impact can continually be so under-appreciated and misunderstood. Travel and tourism is the second largest industry in the United States behind health care, employing more than 13 million Americans both directly and indirectly. Last year, foreign spending on U.S. travel accounted for 39 percent of all service exports and 9 percent of total U.S. exports resulting in a $22 billion trade surplus. The work of the administration gives our country international presence. USTTA plays an important role in helping States and the private sector to develop its international travel market, a part of a coordinated national marketing and economic strategy. State governments and private industry depend on USTTA research to assist them in marketing activities and spending decisions. In Florida, tourism represents a $33 billion a year industry, employing 750,000 residents. International visitors, who make up 20 percent of Florida tourists, also have a regional impact. Often, tourists first visiting the United States will travel to Florida or California. On subsequent visits, however, statistics show they are likely to travel throughout the region or the country. Yet while we are debating this issue today it is imporant to note that the National Governors Association at their 1995 summer meeting, adopted a resolution supporting the USTTA and their proposal to transition the agency into a public private partnership at the end of fiscal year 1996. The resolution states: The Governors believe that a strong public private partnership is essential to promote tourism abroad and increase visitation to the United States. The Governors also believe that in a number of areas, the federal government bears responsibility for functions that can ensure benefits for state and national economies and international visitors. This resolution like the Bryan-Burns amendment has bipartisan support because in the final analysis international tourism promotion is an investment in economic development and job creation. The United States cannot afford to be the only one of 157 developed nations without an official National Tourism Office. Additionally, the first ever White House Conference on Travel and Tourism will bring together the recommendations of over 15,000 travel and tourism representatives from the 55 States and territories. One of the key recommendations to be announced is the strong support for a national tourism office that will serve as a catalyst for implementing a national tourism strategy for the 21st century. Please join me in supporting the Bryan-Burns amendment which provides one additional year of funding at the $12 million level to allow the agency to transition itself in a businesslike and professional manner while implementing the recommendations of the first ever White House Conference of Travel and Tourism. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think we have worked out a good agreement here. We have decided in the committee to terminate this agency. Our dear colleagues asked for a provision that would allow them to phase it out over a year's period with a definite commitment that at the end of the year it is gone, with a transition into a private partnership program. I think it is an excellent amendment. I am happy to accept it. I know Senator Hollings feels the same way, so we are happy to accept this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? The Senator from Nevada. Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I acknowledge publicly my appreciation for the response of the Senator from Texas. I ask unanimous consent the junior Senator from California, Senator Boxer, be listed as a cosponsor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the amendment. The amendment (No. 2840) was agreed to. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote. Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Amendment No. 2841 (Purpose: To protect the reproductive rights of Federal women prisoners) Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the pending amendment is set aside. The clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Snowe, and Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 2841. The amendment is as follows: On page 34, strike lines 1 through 7. Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair. Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield to my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire on the condition I do not lose my right to the floor. Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I seek to propound a unanimous consent request at this time that I will present a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to this amendment that is pending, there will be 20 minutes of debate equally divided, that there will be a vote at 6 o'clock on the sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I ask unanimous consent that be agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, I am prepared to accede to the vote at 6 o'clock providing there is a consent to my amendment which I discussed with the manager. Mr. GRAMM. Which is this? Mr. SPECTER. This is the amendment to strike the language which prohibits the expenditure of funds to pay for abortion for a woman in prison. Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader. Mr. DASCHLE. I will not object with the understanding it has been cleared on our side. Is that the understanding of the Senator from Pennsylvania? Mr. SPECTER. No; it has not been cleared on that side. Mr. DASCHLE. Then we have to object until I have had the opportunity to consult with our manager. Mr. SPECTER. I object to the interruption of the pendency of the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the amendment which I have sent to the desk--I had not sought clearance from Senator Hollings because Senator Gramm objected to it so there was no point in seeking clearance. But the amendment provides we strike lines 1 through 7 on page 34. The amendment would strike the following language: None of the funds appropriated by this title shall be available to pay for abortion except where the life of the mother would be in danger if the fetus were carried to term, or in the case of rape, provided that should this prohibition be declared unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this section shall be null and void. Mr. President, the law at the present time is that a woman in prison may obtain an abortion under circumstances where the prison authorities think it is appropriate to do so. The use of this procedure has been very, very limited. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order. Mr. SPECTER. The procedures have been used on a very limited basis. [[Page S 14632]] From April of 1995 through July 18, only nine abortions were performed on Federal women prisoners. The restrictions on the ban were lifted in late 1993, but when language was not included in the appropriation bill, the Bureau took more than 1 year to reestablish procedures for funding abortion services. In 1994, I am advised that there were 73 live births to Federal prisoners. In 1995 there have been 21 births. The Bureau of Prisons advises that there are nearly 7,000 women incarcerated for Federal crimes, and about 70 percent of those are there on drug offenses. The situation would exist, if this language were to become law, the language which I seek to strike, that women in prison who have a serious medical need would be denied an abortion. They obviously are not in the position to pay for their own abortions when they are in jail and unable to earn any money. By way of background, in 1995, an amendment was offered to prohibit funding to the Federal prison system for abortions on pregnant inmates except when the life of the mother was in danger. A tabling motion failed on a 46 to 46 vote. Then the amendment was defeated on a constitutional point of order--may we have order, Mr. President? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. The amendment was then defeated on a constitutional point of order 47 to 48, that prisoners are legally entitled to adequate medical care when there exists a serious medical need. The thrust of this amendment would place women in prison in a very disadvantaged position, and it is my view this language ought to be stricken. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the amendment offered by the distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania. The amendment would strike from the bill before us the provision which prohibits Federal funds from being used for abortion services for women in Federal prison. But, let me be clear. The amendment would leave intact language in the bill which provides a conscience clause for those opposed to abortion. That language, which this amendment does not touch, ensures that no person would be required to perform, or facilitate in any way the performance of, any abortion. Let me tell you why I believe this amendment must be adopted. The provision contained in the committee-passed bill is part of a wideranging assault on women's reproductive rights. Mr. President, it is going to be a long autumn for America's women. Let us look at what has happened already. The Senate has voted to deny women who are Federal employees coverage under their health plans for abortion services. A Senate/House conference committee has voted to ban abortions for women in the military stationed overseas. The House has voted to let States deny Medicaid abortions for victims of rape and incest. The House version of the D.C. appropriations bill would tell the District of Columbia that it can not use its own, locally raised, revenues for abortions for poor women. Legislation to ban certain late term abortions, even when severe fetal abnormalities are present or the woman's life or health is at serious risk, is under consideration in both the House and Senate. And now, under the bill before us, no abortions for women in Federal prisons. Action after action, vote after vote, we have seen yet another attack on women's reproductive rights. We are facing a full scale assault on women's constitutionally protected right to choose. Those who oppose reproductive rights know better than to launch a direct attack. The public strongly supports the right to choose, and the antichoice forces know it. So, instead they chip away at the right, hoping perhaps that no one will notice that yet another group of women have lost their rights. The bill before us today picks upon a particularly vulnerable population. Women in prison. Women who are totally dependent on health care services provided by the Bureau of Prisons. Let us be honest. There is no significant Federal expense involved in providing abortions for women in Federal prisons. Only nine women have obtained abortions since earlier prohibitions were repealed in 1993. So this is of no real consequence to the Federal budget. Yet, it is a huge issue for the few women who do find themselves in this desperate circumstance. These are not women who have the resources to ever afford private medical services. So by including this provision in this bill we are voting to deny these women access to a legal medical procedure. And who are these women? Over two thirds of the women in Federal prisons are drug offenders. Many of them are in poor health, perhaps HIV-infected, or suffering from AIDS--with all the risks this entails for a developing fetus. Many are themselves victims of abuse. To add to all this, if these women are forced to carry a child to term, they face the certainty that the child will be taken from them. How can we force women facing these circumstances to bear children against their will? To deny these women the right to make their own decision on abortion--a decision carefully arrived at after consultation with a physician and appropriate counseling--is unconscionable. The provision included in this bill is bad policy. It is one more attack on women's reproductive rights. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the amendment offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania. in opposition to back-door approach to undermining the constitutional right to an abortion Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to sections 103 to 105 of the Commerce Justice State appropriations bill. These sections would further undermine the constitutional right to an abortion. The right to an abortion was first articulated by the Supreme Court in the 1973 Roe versus Wade decision. This decision balanced the interests of protecting the fetus with the important interests of the mother, establishing a trimester system under which the right to choice in this country was delineated. Subsequent decisions have held that the Government may not place an undue burden on the woman's right, prior to fetal viability, to make a decision whether or not to have an abortion. There is no right to choose without access to choice. Restricting women's choice on these appropriations bills, and on other unrelated legislation, is a circumspect, back-door approach to prohibiting abortions. For women who cannot afford an abortion on their own, for poor women, this back-door approach to limiting abortions is just one more step to a back alley abortion. The many efforts to undercut the constitutional right to an abortion in this Congress, and earlier Congresses, have been documented by the National Abortion Rights Action League in their publication, ``The Road to the Back Alley.'' I recommend that interested individuals consult this publication. Efforts to undercut a woman's right to choose have included: Blanket restrictions on Federal funding for abortions. As an alternative to unsuccessful congressional efforts to prohibit abortion outright, abortion opponents have worked to ban the use of Federal funds to pay for abortions. These restrictions, popularly referred to as ``Hyde amendments,'' have been attached to appropriations bills ever since Roe Versus Wade. The most recent of such measures was Representative Istook's amendment to give States the option of not providing funds to Medicaid recipients in cases of rape and incest. Banning U.S. aid to international family planning groups performing abortions or abortion counseling. In June, the House approved an amendment to a foreign affairs bill that would ban U.S. aid to any international organizations that perform abortions, counsel women on abortions, or lobby on abortion issues. Prohibiting health insurance companies from paying for abortions for Federal employees. On July 19, the House approved reinstatement of legislation [[Page S 14633]] prohibiting the Federal Employees Health Insurance Program from paying for abortions, except when a woman's life is in danger. The Senate approved similar language on August 4, with exceptions for rape and incest. Barring abortions at military hospitals, even when paid for privately. On June 16, the House voted to restore a ban President Clinton had lifted against privately funded abortions in overseas military hospitals. Prohibiting certain types of late-term abortions. On July 18, the House Judiciary Committee reported legislation that would make it a crime for doctors to perform a late-term abortion procedure called intact D&E. This procedure is extremely rare, and almost exclusively limited to cases in which tragic fetal deformities have been detected. This is only a partial list of the back-door assaults on a woman's right to choose. The proposed language is just one more step in the long line of rollbacks on women's reproductive freedoms. I urge my colleagues to strike this language from the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this is House language in the bill. The House language is very clear. We are talking about taxpayers' money. Both the House and the Senate have taken the position that when the taxpayers' money is being spent to fund abortions, that abortion should be restricted, that it ought to be restricted to rape, to incest, and to the life of the mother. What the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania will do by striking the Hyde language from this bill is to basically give taxpayer funding for abortion on demand. I do not believe that the House or the Senate supports that action, and I am opposed to it. Let me see if any of my colleagues want to speak on the issue. If not, we will have a motion to table. Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to make another attempt at propounding this unanimous consent. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the debate and disposal---- Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, may we have order? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Will Senators and staff please take their conversations to the cloakrooms? The Senator from New Hampshire may proceed. Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of debate on the present Specter amendment, that my sense-of-the-Senate proposal--which would be to the underlying bill which will be offered and not be subject to a second degree--would be debated for 20 minutes, with 10 minutes on both sides, and that there would then be a sequence of votes should there be a vote ordered on the Specter amendment. If there is not a vote ordered on the Specter amendment, then there would be just a vote that would occur on my sense-of-the-Senate amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will agree to that time agreement, and I think 10 minutes on each side is adequate. I will only modify it with the one additional request, that the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, be recognized to offer the next amendment following the disposition of the Specter amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, I want to be sure I understand this. At the conclusion of the debate on this amendment, then the Gregg amendment would follow, and there would be back-to-back votes on my amendment and the amendment by the Senator from New Hampshire. Mr. GREGG. There would be 20 minutes of debate on my sense of the Senate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, is there an understanding as to how long we will be debating the Specter amendment? Could we get a time agreement on that? Mr. GRAMM. It is our intention to move to table the amendment now. Mr. SMITH. Will the Senator yield? I say to the minority leader, I have no intention to debate. I am prepared to move to table. But I do not want to cut the debate off if there are others who wish to speak. At this time, if it is appropriate, I move to table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent offered by the Senator from New Hampshire, as modified by the Democratic leader? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I move to table the Specter amendment. Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from New Hampshire hold off on that for a brief reply to what the Senator from Texas had to say? Mr. SMITH. Yes. I withhold. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, by way of a very brief reply, the language in this bill is even more restrictive than the Hyde amendment. As the Senator from Texas has propounded, the language of the Hyde amendment limits abortion except for rape, incest, or the life of the mother, and that amendment does not even permit an abortion in the event of incest. Rather, the current language of the bill does not permit abortion even in the event of incest. The language is that none of the funds appropriated by this title--in prison, my colleague from Texas says. But a prisoner can be impregnated as a result of incest before coming to prison. This language is even more restrictive than the Hyde language. This language says that none of the funds appropriated by this title shall be available for an abortion except for the life of the mother---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold, the Senate will please come to order. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. SPECTER. Except when the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term, or in the case of rape. It is entirely possible that a woman might be the victim of incest prior to the time she is incarcerated. It still takes 9 months from the time of impregnation to give birth to a child. Incest is a distinct possibility within that time limit. Contrary to what the Senator from Texas has said, this is not a matter of abortion on demand. This is a matter of abortion when the prison authorities permit the abortion to be carried out. It is not a matter that a woman can simply demand it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senate please come to order? Mr. SPECTER. And if there is a case of serious medical need, a woman ought to be entitled to have an abortion. These women are in prison. They are obviously not able in most cases--in many cases--to earn enough money to have an abortion. When the matter is left within the discretion of the prison officials considering all the circumstances, it has been used on a very, very limited basis, with the statistics showing that only seven abortions were conducted in a period of several months since they were begun in April 1995 through mid-July. I think this is a very reasonable position leaving the decision in the hands of the prison authorities, and I urge adoption of the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, if no one seeks recognition for further debate, I move to table the Specter amendment. Mr. FORD. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New Hampshire is recognized for 10 minutes. Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair. Amendment No. 2842 Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg) proposes an amendment numbered 2842. Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. [[Page S 14634]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: At the appropriate place insert the following: It is the sense of the Senate that none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available pursuant to this act should be used for the deployment of combat-equipped forces of the Armed Forces of the United States for any ground operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina unless-- (1) Congress approves in advance the deployment of such forces of the Armed Forces; or (2) the temporary deployment of such forces of the Armed Forces of the United States into Bosnia and Herzegovina is necessary to evacuate United Nations peacekeeping forces from a situation of imminent danger, to undertake emergency air rescue operations, or to provide for the airborne delivery of humanitarian supplies, and the President reports as soon as practicable to Congress after the initiation of the temporary deployment, but in no case later than 48 hours after the initiation of the deployment. Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the amendment which I proposed originally I had planned to offer as to the continuing resolution, as an act versus a sense-of-the-Senate, but in an attempt to accommodate my colleagues-- -- Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, may we have order? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is correct. Staff and Members will please take their conversations to the Cloakroom. Mr. GREGG. To accommodate my colleagues---- Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. I cannot hear the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is correct. The Senators to the left of the Chair, please take their conversations to the Cloakroom. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his courtesy. Mr. President, in an attempt to accommodate my colleagues, who I understand wish to move on to other business but who I also think desire to speak on this issue in some manner before we break for a week, I have made this---- Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I may say, there are conversations on the floor of the U.S. Senate when the Senator is trying to speak about a very crucial issue that is a matter of life and death, and I urge, if the Chair could, the Chair to be even stronger than he has been to get some order because it is hard for me to hear sitting right across from the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is attempting to be strong. I hope the Senators will be strong in holding forth their conversations elsewhere. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair for his strength. The purpose of this amendment is to raise the issue of how this legislative body should address the pending potential introduction of troops into Bosnia, American troops. The administration has stated on a number of occasions that it is a distinct possibility that up to 25,000 American soldiers will be asked to serve on the ground in Bosnia. That, of course, creates a significant issue first for those soldiers who would be putting their lives at risk but also for us as a country as to whether or not it is appropriate for us to be asking our men and women to put at risk their lives in this conflict. It seems, when there has been such a clear statement of purpose and potential risk for American troops, it is appropriate that we as a Congress act to either approve that action or disapprove that action. Clearly, the power to undertake actions which put American soldiers' lives in harm's way lies primarily and first with the President, but obviously we as a Congress also play a major role, not only on the appropriating side but, more importantly, on the side of being concerned for our soldiers, many of whom will obviously be our constituents. Therefore, I feel strongly that prior to the President taking this action, he should come to the Congress and ask for our approval. I believe he should meet three tests before we give him that approval. First, he should be able to define what it is that the soldiers will be asked to undertake, what the conflict is that we will be entering and what our role is in that conflict. Second, he should be able to explain to us the length of time and the manner in which they are going to serve when they are on the ground and what sort of risks they will be put at. And, third he needs to be able to express to us how we will be getting our soldiers out. I think it is very important that he define in this process what our national interest is in putting American lives at risk. That is the bottom line, I believe, that he must satisfy as President. In addressing that issue, the appropriate body to address it to, obviously, is the American people but also the Congress of the United States as the representative of the American people. Therefore, I do feel it is absolutely critical that before troops are deployed in this region, especially in the numbers which are being considered by the administration--25,000--we have a full and open debate of the matter here in the Congress and that we get from the President a clear and precise and understandable definition of purpose in undertaking this very serious act. So this sense-of-the-Senate resolution essentially addresses that issue. It says that the President shall come to the Congress before he sends troops into harm's way in Bosnia except in certain limited circumstances. The language which I have agreed to is actually language which I originally drafted and then presented to the other side, which was reviewed, and to which they made some adjustments, and I understand it is now acceptable to the Democratic leader. As such, I hope we could have strong support of this because it is clearly the role of the Congress to undertake this sort of debate and pursue this sort of action before our troops are deployed in this type of situation. I reserve the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who controls time in opposition to the amendment? Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I believe I am in control. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia. Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, could I be notified after 4 minutes? Mr. President, I agree with this amendment expressing the sense of the Senate that none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available pursuant to this act shall be used for deployment of combat equipped forces of the Armed Forces of the United States for any ground operations in Bosnia unless, and then the two conditions as set forth: Congress approves in advance deployment of such forces of the Armed Forces and the temporary deployment authority. Mr. President, this amendment does not have the effect of law and does not tie the President's hands. It does state the sentiment and view of the Senate of the United States. If it did tie the President's hands at this critical juncture while the peace negotiations are underway, I would oppose it and vote against it. We should not tie the hands of the President at this critical juncture. If the word went out that there was going to be no U.S. participation after a peace agreement is entered into, then there likely would be no peace agreement entered into by the parties. Mr. President, America must lead. We have seen what happens when we do not lead. We have recently seen what happens when we do lead. Our leadership must be in NATO and through NATO. Our objections to deployment, if there are objections to deployment, of troops by the United States should also be applicable to NATO troops because we are part of that alliance. It is not just the United States we are concerned about. It is also our allies and the alliance itself. Our conditions for deployment should be made known through NATO and that forum. Before any decision is made to deploy U.S. forces or in my view NATO forces pursuant to a peace agreement, we should ask a number of questions, a very difficult set of questions, a very important set of questions regarding that deployment. The first question that I would have--and there would probably be others that would occur to me as time goes on--are the borders between the various factions under the peace agreement both definable and defendable? Is [[Page S 14635]] this a sound peace agreement? If we are deploying pursuant to a peace agreement, the key question is, what kind of peace agreement? Is it a sound peace agreement? Does it have a reasonable chance of success? And can U.S. forces and NATO forces enhance the prospects of success? The second question I would have: Has the President clearly made the case to the American people that the deployment of U.S. ground forces is important to America's national security? That case must be made. The American people must understand this. They must support it. That is a condition that has to be fulfilled if we are going to have a sustainable position if things get rough in Bosnia. And they could get rough--no one should be mistaken about that--although the risk has gone down substantially compared to a month ago when the lines were not as clear as they have been since the recent ground action. Mr. President, the concern I have would not be simply the rights of the Bosnian Moslems versus the Bosnian Serbs but also the rights of the Bosnian Moslems vis-a-vis the Croatian-Bosnians, if that kind of federation breaks up. And it is very important that federation not break up. Another question, Mr. President, that I think has to be discussed by our executive branch and by Congress, do we have an exit strategy? By that I mean, do we know when the mission will be successful, when it will end and how we define success? That involves at least deciding in advance with our allies whether we are going to arm the Bosnian Moslems before we exit--before we exit--or whether we are going to find another way to level the playing field so that the parties can defend their own territory including the possibility of a build down. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 4 minutes. Mr. NUNN. I yield myself 1 more minute, Mr. President. Mr. President, the other question that occurs to me at this moment is whether NATO is clearly going to be in charge. NATO must be in charge. There must be no dual key. We cannot have a repeat of what we have had in the last 2 years with the United Nations having the dual key. I believe it is also imperative, if we are going to deploy NATO forces and U.S. forces, that we deploy a robust force, a force that is big enough and tough enough and well enough equipped not to be pushed around and to defend itself in the event of any kind of conflict. There must be clear rules of engagement. And those rules of engagement must permit a very vigorous response to any attack on U.S. forces or NATO forces. Mr. President, these are just a few of the questions that I believe are important. I reserve the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Lieberman and Senator Domenici as cosponsors. I yield 2 minutes to Senator Specter. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SPECTER. I support this sense-of-the-Senate resolution because I think it is indispensable that advance approval be given by Congress before U.S. troops are deployed, absent the emergency situation described in subparagraph 2. When the distinguished Senator from Georgia talks about impeding the ultimate peace agreement, it seems to me that we ought to put everyone on notice that congressional approval is required before there will be a commitment of 25,000 U.S. personnel. What we are really involved in in modern times is that the constitutional authority of the Congress to declare war has been undermined by the conflict in Korea, which was really a war without a congressional declaration, and by the Vietnam war, which was really a conflict there without a congressional declaration, the Gulf of Tonkin resolution not really being a substitute. There was very serious debate on the floor of this body in January of 1991 when the use of force was authorized. I took the position, as did many Senators, that the President, a Republican President, George Bush, did not have the authority to go into the gulf war without congressional authorization. The questions which have been posed by the Senator from Georgia are very important questions for congressional debate. We should not have a decision made to obligate U.S. personnel without congressional authority. And everyone who is a party to the negotiations there ought to understand that that is the position of the Congress. Without support from the American people, the military action cannot be sustained. That support is determined by the action of the Congress of the United States. So this is a very important resolution to put everyone on notice, including the President of the United States. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields time? Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator from Georgia yield me 1 minute? Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia. Mr. NUNN. I yield the Senator from Michigan 1 minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 1 minute. Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator and I thank the Chair. I wonder if the Senator would be willing to answer a question relative to his understanding of this resolution. I, first of all, think he laid out a series of very important questions, and I concur that those are critical questions that need to be answered prior to the use of ground forces in Bosnia. But my question of the Senator is this: He pointed out this is not legally binding because it is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. If this same language at a later time were offered without the words that it is a ``sense of the Senate'' so that it did then become a legally binding document or language, would it be consistent for those of us who might vote yes today to vote no at a later time because of the timing of the offer of that language or for any other of a number of possible reasons? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator yield me 30 additional seconds? Mr. NUNN. I yield myself 30 seconds. I will respond to the Senator from Michigan that his question should be answered, yes, it would be consistent. There is a great deal of difference in expressing to the President what the view of the Senate is and then passing a law that binds the President, particularly when this kind of negotiation is going on. So it would be consistent. Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. GREGG. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized for 2 minutes. Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I went to the White House today and met with the President and Members of the Senate on this particular subject. I took the occasion at that time to make three points: First, the American public needs to fully and completely understand what U.S. national security interests are at stake before the United States commits or sends United States service men and women to Bosnia. Next, the President of the United States should not commit or send U.S. troops without congressional approval. Now, if that congressional approval is given--this is the third point--any U.S. forces will have to be under the NATO operational control with robust rules of engagement. And I feel that this is such a serious situation, that these three points should be observed in considering this important matter. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire also for working out language with us. This is precisely the same thing we have already voted on in the Senate by 99 to 1. We basically already approved this language. It is a variation in the language here today. But it is the same principle. And the principle is very simple; that if we are going to engage in a large-scale peacekeeping effort, the country is better off and the President [[Page S 14636]] is better off with approval from Congress. I think it is very important to note that the meeting that the Senator from South Carolina just talked about today was attended broadly by House and Senate Members, bipartisan leadership. The President made it very clear, saying that he thought President Bush did the right thing in coming to Congress to ask for approval. He thought the Congress did the right thing in giving it. But we should remember that President Bush sent 500,000 troops to the gulf prior to any approval from Congress. All he had was a sense-of-the-Senate resolution saying this was OK after the fact. The President appropriately has reserved the right with respect to constitutional power not to make a commitment. And we should not hold him to that. So I think it is entirely appropriate here today to say that a sense of the Senate should have unanimous approval. But if this were a law tying the hands of the President, I think many Members on the other side would also join us in disapproving it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. NUNN. I reserve the remainder of my time. How much time do I have remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 55 seconds. Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, of that time, I yield to the Senator from Illinois 1 minute and I yield to the Senator from Connecticut 55 seconds. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 1 minute. Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I agree with everything the Senator from Georgia had to say. I reach a different conclusion. And I may be the only one voting against this. Tom Friedman of the New York Times had a column recently in which he said, ``France acts like a great power but does not have the resources. The United States has the resources but does not act like a great power.'' We cannot have effective foreign policy if Congress micromanages it. The Senator from Georgia asks a series of questions. I think there is one other question. Does it help peace in Bosnia to adopt this resolution? I think it unnecessarily raises questions, and I am going to vote against the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for the remaining time. Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment. I am privileged to be a cosponsor of it because I think it ought to be the beginning of bipartisan cooperation on this question of authorizing American troops to be part of a peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. The fact is that this amendment is consistent with what President Clinton has said. He has clearly said he expects and would welcome congressional action prior to any dispatch of American troops to Bosnia to enforce a genuine and just peace agreement. Mr. President, I want to make very clear that I view the exercise of American leadership to bring about the NATO strikes which have brought Bosnia now to the verge of peace as an exercise of leadership which has revived NATO's credibility. There is no way, if there is a peace agreement, that we can maintain our credibility and NATO's if we do not contribute American troops to that peacekeeping force. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. Mr. GREGG. How much time do I have remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 2 minutes 40 seconds. Mr. GREGG. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Maine. Mr. COHEN. Let me take a moment to challenge the notion that somehow the U.S. Senate is engaged in micromanagement. We are talking about the President of the United States, who is considering deploying 25,000 troops to one of the most hostile regions in the world, that has been filled for centuries with ethnic hatred, poison and death. And we are talking about deploying those troops to that region without having any sort of defined plan presented to us, without knowing what the ground rules are going to be, so to speak, without knowing who is in charge, without knowing what the Russian role is going to be. If ever there was a case in which we ought to be consulted and give approval, it is this one. Let me also take issue with those who said, ``Well, President Bush finally came to Congress.'' It was only after we insisted day in and day out and by going down to the White House, that the President finally agreed to come to Congress to get authority. Before that President Bush was determined to say, ``I only have to get authority from the United Nations, that's where I get my authority.'' We resisted that, and we actually forced the administration to come to us. Not only was it politically wise for him to do so, but we believe he was constitutionally mandated to do so. So the notion that somehow we are micromanaging is misconceived. We are the ones who raise and support the Army, and we have a coequal responsibility, not just the President, if we start deploying 25,000 troops to a region that has been afflicted over the centuries with hatred and conflict. Mr. President, I support the Senator's resolution. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 40 seconds remaining. Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this resolution lays down the ground rules for any major American involvement in Bosnia, and essentially they are: The President must explain to this Congress and the American people what the national interest is which justifies putting American lives at risk, and must receive the approval of this Congress before those lives are put at risk. That is a reasonable request in a democracy, and I appreciate the support of the Members of the Senate in this matter. Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The majority leader. Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I will use 2 minutes of my leader's time to comment on the pending matter. We had a good meeting with the President this afternoon. Many of us were there, Republicans and Democrats. I think he understands the administration needs to present their case to Congress. I asked three questions, very short questions: How many? How long? And how much? How many American troops, men and women are going to go to Bosnia? How long are they going to be there? And how much will it cost? That is the first thing the American people want to know. I believe we are making progress in that part of the world because of the bipartisan efforts of Members of Congress who have stood firm in support of a small nation, an independent nation, a member of the United Nations, Bosnia and Herzegovina. That plus the Croatian military action a couple of months ago, in my view, moved us along, plus the negotiating efforts by the administration. So I think everybody can take some credit. But the case has not been made to this point. It may be made, perhaps it will be made. The view I had from the President, without quoting anything he said, is that he certainly understood that they would have to come up and make their case. They are going to ask for money, and I think they will go before the Foreign Relations Committee, maybe the Armed Services Committee and maybe make an excellent case. I know how bitter some of the debate was during the gulf crisis, and I know many in this body said we ought to have sanctions, that sanctions would work. We still have sanctions, and Saddam Hussein is still there. It has been years and years, so that was not the right way to go. In any event, I hope that we will do what we should do. We are talking about American lives, American young men and women, and we do need to make a very careful judgment, and I think this sends a strong signal that we will make that careful judgment. I thank my colleague. Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. [[Page S 14637]] Mr. EXON addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska. Mr. EXON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be granted 1 minute for debate before the vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. EXON. Madam President, I wish to congratulate the majority leader for the remarks he just made. I thought it was an excellent meeting at the White House today. I will simply say that I think the President unquestionably has agreed to consult with the Congress. I believe that commitment was made again today. This is a very critical time. I hope and believe that adoption of this measure is meaningless, but I hope and think at this particular time we could do no good by adopting this once again, but, obviously, it will be adopted. I will oppose it because I think it is ill-timed for us to be stepping into this matter once again at this particular juncture. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter the President sent to me on October 20, 1993. Let me read one paragraph: I also have made clear that it would be helpful to have a strong expression of support of the United States Congress prior to the participation of U.S. forces in implementation of a Bosnian peace accord. For that reason, I would welcome and encourage congressional authorization of any military involvement in Bosnia. There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: The White House, Washington, DC, October 20, 1993. Hon. Robert Dole, United States Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Leader: The violent conflict in the former Yugoslavia continues to be a source of deep concern. As you know, my Administration is committed to help stop the bloodshed and implement a fair and enforceable peace agreement, if the parties to the conflict can reach one. I have stated that such enforcement potentially could include American military personnel as part of a NATO operation. I have also specified a number of conditions that would need to be met before our troops would participate in such an operation. I also have made clear that it would be helpful to have a strong expression of support from the United States Congress prior to the participation of U.S. forces in implementation of a Bosnian peace accord. For that reason, I would welcome and encourage congressional authorization of any military involvement in Bosnia. The conflict in Bosnia ultimately is a matter for the parties to resolve, but the nations of Europe and the United States have significant interests at stake. For that reason, I am committed to keep our nation engaged in the search for a fair and workable resolution to this tragic conflict. In closing, I want to express my sincere appreciation and respect for the manner in which we have been able to work together on important issues affecting national security. Over the years, the greatest successes in American foreign policy have had bipartisan support. I am gratified that we have been able to sustain that tradition and thank you for your leadership in that regard. Sincerely, Bill Clinton \": 'target_text',\n",
       " \"REPORT OF FACTFINDING TRIP Mr. DORNAN. Mr. Speaker, we have had a fast 3 days. Started late on Wednesday, finishing early today. Pressure is building up here for a major budgetary struggle between the two major, only major parties in the world's only superpower, on all of these budgetary issues. We have come back from a long, what we sometimes euphemistically call a district work period. We are supposed to cram in a vacation and work hard. For some of us, it is hard work. I took one of the more difficult and fast-moving factfinding trips of my career, now that I am one of only two double chairmen out of all 435 Members of this Chamber. I chair a Subcommittee on Intelligence, the Subcommittee on Technical and Tactical Intelligence, and I chair the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, which becomes the most important of all 5 military subcommittees under the Committee on National Security, what used to be called Armed Services, and is still called Armed Services in the House of Lords or the other Chamber, the Senate. On this trip, in discussing the issues with new young enlisted men, senior sergeants, petty officers, and the officer corps at all levels, up to and including four-star admirals, at Naples, at the major air base that is in command of all the bombing missions going on as we speak over poor torn ripped Bosnia-Herzegovina. And at Brendezy, down at the coast at the very heel of the Italian peninsula. That is where we have our Navy Seals, where we have what was a major listening post base. In all the world, there are only five listening to everything, San Vito Air Station, using the international airport at Brendezy where we keep our AC-130 Hercules special mission Spectre gun ships. I met with all the crews there. It is still classified whether or not they are going in at night over Bosnia. These were the aircraft that if we had them in Somalia over Mogadishu, we would have saved a dozen or more lives of our best trained Army special forces and Delta Force, Rangers and 160th Aviation Regiment, special armed squadrons. Then I traveled with Congressman Greg Laughlin, the highest ranking active reservist in the House or the Senate, of Galveston, TX, and we went to Slovenia. A fascinating, brand-new country in the world. It never had nation status, let alone a seat in the United Nations since the dissolution of the Communist country of the former Yugoslavia. {time} 1315 Then we went down to Croatia, met with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's special representative to all of the problems in former Yugoslavia, Mr., that is his formal title, Mr. Sasushi Akashi, met with him at the U.N. headquarters, the blue helmet home plate in Zagreb, then went down along the Dalmatian coast, drove slowly through all of the destruction wreaked upon one of the world's most beautiful coastlines, looks for all the world like the California coastline between Santa Barbara and Monterey--just torn apart. The international airport in Zadar utterly destroyed except for the runways, all of the international terminal buildings, hollow shells of aluminum, like a nuclear explosion went off, the tower, all the windows shot out with AK-47's by the retreating Bosnian soldiers. They almost cut Croatia in half at that point, Zadar. Then we went down to Macedonia, met with all of our American tripwire forces out in the front outposts along the border, flew on white helicopters, UH-60 Blackhawks that, of course, called themselves the Whitehawks, with the United Nations stenciled on the sides, went out to these American outposts, studied this poor city of Skopje, which had been destroyed by an earthquake in 1963. It has never really made it back to a stable, functioning city, still great pockets of poverty from that horrible earthquake in 1963. Then we flew over to Albania, one of the most godforsaken but still physically beautiful countries in the world, and met with the president there, Sali Berisha, Mr. Berisha; he is a European renowned heart surgeon. His wife is a renowned doctor of pediatrics, a child doctor. What a lucky country to go from the depths of communism with a paranoidal maniac, Enver Hoxna, one of the last psychotic, paranoid Communist dictators in the world, who literally took this beautiful country of Albania, a brand new country created after World War I, not a traditional nation on the face of the Earth, and just drove it into the ground, more than a half-century of locked-up paranoia and total Communist psychotic oppression, and now they have a wonderful president who said to me and to the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Laughlin], although he wants to be in the United Nations and would like to be accepted into NATO, he does not care what happens in the world if he just has the friendship of the United States, just one on one, unilateral friendship, and he thinks Albania will make it into the 21st century. That is the identical message we got north of there in another one of the eight parts of Yugoslavia that have spun off in Solvenia, same message: ``U.S. friendship is what we want.'' In Albania, we looked at what was supposed to be a top-secret program [[Page H 8715]] and is now written about in all newspapers, the Predator, unmanned aerial vehicle [UAV] program. The pilots at that base, both Albanian and our U.S. Forces there, took us in a cave that the Chinese carved out of a mountain, a cave as long as several football fields, and there I looked at 24 or 25 MiG aircraft from the vintage of when I flew almost 40 years ago. There were MiG-19, ``Farmer'' was our NATO codeword, jets that they still fly, that were Russia's response to my F-100 Supersabre, and older jets from Korea, MiG Alley, early 1950's, MiG-15's and MiG-17's, the kind of airplane my colleague, the gentleman from California [Mr. Cunningham], shot down in North Vietnam. At least of his five victories, three are MiG-17's, all of this in this giant tunnel. And the landscape of the country is scarred, marred with 700,000 to 1 million concrete bunkers, pillboxes, machine gun posts, some of them as big as the entire rostrum of this House, others as big as from here to the other lectern, a million of them, maybe, making the whole landscape look ugly, and there is no money to remove them or drag them out to the sea and make a breakwater for a small boat harbor on this beautiful Dalmatian coast of the Adriatic. On that trip, at every stop I would take off my chairman's hat from intelligence and put on my chairman's hat from military personnel and ask our men and women at all levels of command what it will take to keep them in the military, to keep that expensive training that they were given to melt down the evil empire of the Soviet Union and stand guard over freedom and be part of the world's only superpower, and everywhere they talked about family, and quality of life; they spoke of what it would take them to earn a proper living with groceries, their compensation. So, all around that hot area of the world, I saw again that America is so lucky, as Ronald Reagan used to quote James Michener's great fictitious, but more fact than fiction, novel from the Korean war, ``The Bridges of Toko-Ri,'' ``Where do we get such men,'' and now we can say women, ``Where do we get such men and women?'' How are we so lucky as to have them serve us? The sad thing about this break, Mr. Speaker, is that we went through some of the greatest anniversaries with the House adjourned. The 50th anniversary of the end of the greatest crusade for freedom against tyranny in all of recorded history during our break, the 50th anniversary endings. We had adjourned by the time Sunday came up for the 50th anniversary of the bombing at Hiroshima; 3 days later Nagasaki, August 9. On August 15 in the Pacific, on the other side of the dateline, August 14 here, the end of shooting in the Second World War; not really so; Japanese imperial warload staff beheaded prisoners, shot them, killed all the prisoners at Unit 371 in Pingfan, outside of Mukden, Manchuria. They called these godforsaken human beings ``logs,'' to depersonalize them. They had shot them, amputated all four of their limbs, one at a time, let them recover from each amputation, training over a thousand doctors to go out to all the tentacles of the imperial octopus that was so abusing the whole eastern perimeter, western perimeter of the Pacific around Asia. They had boiled them to death to see what it was like. They had frozen them to death. They had tied them to trees and hit them with bombs and shrapnel and grenades. They had put flamethrowers on them. They had infected them with anthrax, all forms of biological warfare, and none of these people that I know of were brought to justice. That is why everybody is so grateful to the current Prime Minister of Japan, that he offered an apology that we cannot get out of their congress, their ``diet,'' but there were men killed after August 15 over there, and August 14 here. Many prisoners died. My friend, Jack Singlaub, was parachuted in with a small OSS team to the Chinese island of Hainan, under Japanese warload control. Notice I say ``warlord,'' to distinguish ourselves from the free democracy of Japan today, and it was mostly, it was all Australian and New Zealand prisoners, no Americans there. He loaded them on trains from this prison camp on the western side of Hainan island and took them over to the biggest port on the eastern side, and five or six Australian and New Zealand prisoners died on that train, but at least they died as free men. That was a very rough 2-week period. All of the prisoners were under death orders. If the United States invasion forces of Operation Olympic had set foot on the Japanese home islands, all prisoners were to be executed. Many were beheaded and beaten to death in the streets of Japanese cities if they were unfortunate enough to bail out over their target. Many of them miraculously survived. War crimes trials in Japan, but far less than those that were brought to the bar of justice, Hitler's war criminals. So we passed through all of those anniversaries without a word on this House floor, because we were out. Then came V-J Day. I decided I would spend V-J Day at our airbases encircling tortured Bosnia rather than be in Hawaii, where I planned to be and was invited to go with a World War II veteran, a young-looking gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Stump. I wanted to be on that trip, but I was so offended by the photo opportunities of the White House at the Normandy beaches to the exclusion of some of our heroes when they should have been the focus, that I did not want to subject myself to that, and I would have been pained to hear Mr. Clinton call the U.S.S. Missouri, the battleship upon which the Japanese surrender terms were unconditionally signed on September 2, 1945, I would have been pained to hear Mr. Clinton call it a carrier, an aircraft carrier. I would have been pained to hear him refer to the front of the ship, the bow, as the bow, as in a bow in your hair, and I guess he would call the stern the back side of the ship. If that had been Vice President Dan Quayle making verbal mistakes like that, you would all know about it. It would be headlines. But people are probably listening to C-SPAN today, 1,300,000 who think I am making that up. No, Mr. Clinton actually said those things, aircraft carrier Missouri, bow of it, as in bow and arrow, the bow of the ship. He got away with it. I preferred to be out with the troops in the field rather than at those wonderful closing ceremonies. But now a word here on the floor, Mr. Speaker. Here is what has been painful to me over the last 4 years: Except for the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. Montgomery], two-star general, retired in the Army, of the Montgomery GI bill fame, and the aforementioned gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Stump], Navy retiree, except for one 1-hour special order that they did on Iwo Jima, there has not been a single memorial on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives or the United States Senate for any single 50-year anniversary of anything that happened all during World War II, not Pearl Harbor, not the fall of Bataan, or the Bataan death march, not Corredigor, not the comeback at Guadalcanal, not the landings in Tarawa, not the Dieppe raid along the coast of Hitler's fortress Europe, not Al Alamein, not the battles at Tobruk, not the Kasserine Pass, not the landings at Sicily in July 9, 1943; we have heard here in July 1993, not Salerno, not Anzio, not Operation Overlord on D-Day, not Operation Dragon down on the southern coast of France, nothing about Okinawa, which came after Iwo Jima or the Gilbert Islands or Marshall Islands or the Battle of the Coral Sea or the Battle of Midway or the Battle of the Solomon Islands or the Santa Cruz Islands, nothing for 4 years in the Senate or the House floor pausing for a series of 1-minute speeches or 1-minute special orders. I am not saying this to pat myself on the back; except for about 10 of my 1-hour special orders, nothing, nothing on this House floor. I remember an Oklahoma Congressman shut this place down. I remember it because he lost his primary a few months later. I wondered if there was a connection. I think his name was Congressman Risenhoover. He shut this place down. We filled it with potted palms, and on Flag Day, June 14 in some late year in the late 1970's, I forget the year, we had the great western singers, June Carter and Johnny Cash, standing up there. We sang patriotic hymns, and we did Flag Day, and there was nothing special. It was not the 50th anniversary of Flag Day, or silver anniversary. It was just Flag Day, any June 14. The whole place shut down, palms, [[Page H 8716]] potted plants all over at every entrance. I have never seen the like of it, potted plants all around the front here. We do not do that for a State of the Union with the Commander in Chief standing up there. We did not do that for Douglas MacArthur or Winston Churchill the two times he stood up there. {time} 1330 I thought, ``Wow, we are going to do this, I guess, all during World War II. Am I lucky to be here.'' And, when George Bush got elected, because I went with President Bush to Pearl Harbor's 50th anniversary, and we stood there on that memorial across the midships of the U.S.S. Arizona, still a ship of the line, with the flag run up at reveille every morning. I thought, ``This is going to be great, go through all these 50-year anniversaries with a 58 combat mission Navy attack carrier pilot in the White House.'' And instead we ended up with someone who had avoided the draft three times, has insulted the military over, and over, and over with photo opportunities, using them to try to up his ratings, and thank God it fails every time, and here we are, past September 2, 1995, 50 years gone by. No memorials. Today I have an editorial, a counter-editorial, in the USA Today. They always put in the left-right views. They called my office at 2 o'clock yesterday, said, ``Give us something quick. Senator Warner is not responding fast enough, the No. 2 man on Armed Services Committee in the other body.'' They said, ``Give us something on why the military should be built up.'' We pumped out something quickly. I sent a corrected copy on a fax to USA Today at 3:30, and I said, ``Well, this will be in next week,'' and it is in this morning, a turnaround of about 15 hours before it hit the streets, and I would like to read it, Mr. Speaker. It says, ``Military Needs Buildup.'' It is what every one of these young, not-so-young, people all around the Mediterranean told me. ``Robert K. Dornan, opposing view: The military budget has been hit year after year. Security demands that we spend more.'' Now I have not read the USA Today house editorial that says we must gut defense even more, but here is my response on September 8: ``After 11 straight years of defense spending cuts, Republicans are providing the national security leadership not found in the current administration. ``Indeed, President Clinton's draconian defense budget would produce another Carter-era ``hollow force'' reportedly underfunded by as much as $150 billion. Congress, therefore, is not squandering money when it votes to increase the Pentagon's budget by $7 billion more than requested. Instead, it is restoring national security funding to necessary levels. ``How soon we forget what is required to quickly and decisively win on the modern battlefield. ``Today's military modernization is tomorrow's combat readiness. Systems such as the F-117 `Nighthawk' stealth fighter and the Patriot missile were not developed overnight. They were the culmination of years of research and development. These revolutionary systems drastically reduced our casualties'' killed in acting and wounded in action) ``in Desert Storm.'' more than any other conflict in history given the level of lethality, and violence, and speed, and maneuverability. ``Today we can improve upon these systems with new weapons that will further reduce the risk to American troops. ``The B-2 `Spirit' Stealth bomber,'' I helped to name that, so of course I want to get the name in, ``carries eight times the payload of the F-117, with greater range and crew survivability.'' Keep in mind, listening audience, Mr. Speaker, and my colleagues who may be packing up their bags in their offices to head back to their districts, that the B-2 survived in this Chamber by 3 votes, 213 to 210, to defeat an amendment, mostly by people who have never served in the military, to kill and shut down the world's only bomber production line, the B-2 ``Spirit.'' ``New missile defense programs, such as the upgraded Navy Aegis (A-e- g-i-s) system, provide greater range, accuracy, and coverage than Patriot missiles.'' We call that upper-tier Navy defense. Put two ships off Israel, two ships off Korea, just two ships, and the footprint from both those ships can keep Israel free from being struck with a nuclear weapon or, as we now find out from the defecting son-in-law of dictator, mad-dog killer Saddam Hussein; we now find out that, yes, they were driving to completion of a nuclear weapon and were playing around with the most deadly biological, and chemical, and nerve gas weapons since World War II and would have used them, and may have used them; the jury is out on that. So we need this Navy upper-tier Aegis system antimissile defense. ``Does the Pentagon need these expensive new programs? Ask the Air Force pilots who will not have to attack highly defended enemy targets in vulnerable, unstealthy aircraft because they will have the B-2. Ask the Marines and Army troops who will not have to worry about Scud ballistic missile attacks because of the Navy's new ballistic missile defense.'' All of this, of course, predicated upon the conference between the House and the Senate, the conference process that we are entering, that we entered this afternoon. My R&D Subcommittee is meeting as I speak. I decided that letting America know what we are doing was more important than participating in that meeting because I am not the chairman of that subcommittee; the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Weldon] is. My close in today's USA Today: ``These and other Republican initiatives in areas such as personnel and training will not just maintain, but will enhance, the combat capability that has so quickly deteriorated under Clinton's leadership. ``Those of us who visit,'' as I did in the Balkans over this break our troops, ``and listen to our front-line troops are giving them what they need,'' what they deserve, ``including equipment that will drastically reduce loss of'' precious, ``life.'' ``The Reagan revolution of the 1980's laid the foundation for'' the victory in, ``Desert Storm. The Republican revolution'' that started on November 8, ``of 1994 is laying the foundation for any future victories, if that is our fate, and the survival of U.S. combat troops well into the 21st century.'' Now, Mr. Speaker, I had intended to spend the better part of this hour special order on defense on some of the votes that we won this week. We won them all on the conservative side with the help of many conservative members of the former majority party, the oldest political party in America, the Democrats, but last night I kept a promise that I made to a Navy Seal at Brandezy, Italy. I do not want to identify him by rank, but let us put it this way. All the Seal's in the Mediterranean depend on this fine young officer and Annapolis graduate from decades ago. He said to me, ``Congressman Dornan, I appreciate you being in the Presidential race, although it appears you don't have much chance of victory, as I appreciate Mr. Keyes, Alan Keyes, of Maryland, because you discuss the moral issues which I believe are the critical issues of our time.'' Now keep in mind this is a senior naval officer trained to the peak of physical and mental performance for his country. He said, ``Congressman, I believe as a naval officer that the military culture is the last stable part of American life from which we can begin the rebuilding of our Nation's moral fiber, from which we can begin to defend the moral and cultural ethos that is collapsing around us.'' Now I would like to think there is a pocket of us on both sides of the aisle in the House and the Senate that also believe that we are in an advanced state of moral decline in our country. He said to me, this naval officer, ``Did you see the cover story of Newsweek in July on bissexuality?'' I said, ``No, captain, I did not.'' He said, ``Well, I canceled my subscription with a long letter to the New York publisher and senior editors saying that this was the most vile and corrupt article I've ever seen in my life.'' And I said, ``Well, every week in my office I get 10 magazines and about 10 newspapers,'' and I said, ``I try to read as much as any human being in the [[Page H 8717]] House or Senate. With all due immodesty, I've never seen anybody that reads more.'' And I said, ``I did not see this particular Newsweek. I can go weeks without even catching a cover story in Time, or Newsweek, or U.S. News and World Report, or all the other magazines that we get. Then there is all the great conservative publications, the moderate ones like New Republic I try to stay up with, and Crisis, and First Things, and cutting edge of Catholic and Protestant, conservative, magazines, and of course Bill Buckley, my old pal, with National Review--awful lot to read. We have tremendous responsibility here to stay informed on what our Speaker Gingrich calls the ``information highway'' to be an alert, informed man or woman in this place. It is an overwhelming job if you're trying to inform yourself of all aspects of the popular culture and try to cover the economic front, the foreign affairs front, the human rights front, the defense front, all the social issues at home, gang warfare, the O.J. Simpson trial, not as a gawking ``Lookie Lou,'' but as someone aware that this trial, as the Menendez trial has done, can put our whole jury system in jeopardy.'' And I promised this Navy SEAL that I would get the Newsweek article out of my huge piles of reading material in my office and take a look at it. I have only been home since the first of September. I got it out last night and read it. Here it is, Mr. Speaker. It is the Newsweek issue of July 17, so it hit the newsstands on Monday, July 10. I read it last night, and I agree with this naval officer, assigned at a forward base in Italy, a kind of a man who will go in and put his life on the line if another Captain Scott O'Grady gets shot down along the coast. The Navy SEAL's will have the job to go in and rescue them under fire, and I agree with this naval officer. This is the most corrupt article, let alone a cover story, that I have ever read in an American magazine in my life--Newsweek. The Washington bureau chief, and we are having our problems right now over another issue that personally involves my honor, and I will do a 1-hour special order or a personal privilege in the middle of the day-- no, I would not do that in September, budget month--to defend my honor from an attack by a reporter who has only been--who was not even hired when this issue came out, who attacked my honor and said I crashed four aircraft in the Air Force. I have not crashed one. Ejected twice from totally out-of-control aircraft, but he doubled that to four and said I crashed them and said I was a black ace, one kind of black ace. The only black aces I know were an F-14 squadron called the ``Black Aces'' in the unheralded until the HBO special in the last few weeks, the 99th fighter squadron, and then the 332nd Fighter Group, the Tuskegee airmen, our young fighter pilots in the Italian theatre of African- American heritage who are finally getting their recognition 52 years after they entered combat. That is the only ``Black Aces'' I know about. But I am having my problems with Evan Thomas, who I think is one of the better talking heads. He will be on television tomorrow, on a program called ``Inside U.S.A.,'' a handsome young man, and we are having out problems on this, but I have not talked to him about this issue, and I will. I am going to fly up to New York. I am going to go see Donald and Katharine Graham. She is chairman emeritus and has discussed this issue. I almost wonder if I can read this in the Chamber, but listen to this. I wish you folks were not leaving up there because--well, get the Congressional Record tomorrow and read this. Here is the article on bisexuality. It is under ``Lifestyle,'' of course. ``Bisexuality is the wild card of our erotic life. Now it is coming out in the open, in pop culture, in cyberspace, and on campus. But can you really have it both ways?'' They asked rhetorically, question mark, by John Leland. The answer is Newsweek thinks you can because in this article, one of America's great magazines--when I was a little kid coming out of St. Patrick's, I used to look at their beautiful headquarters building right there on Fifth Avenue across from Tiffany somewhere. Newsweek, which is owned by the Washington Post, one of America's three major newspapers, all of them liberal: L.A. Times, New York Times, Washington Post. They own this, so it is under Katharine and Donald Graham. Here is what Newsweek says about this issue. Brace yourself for culture shock if you are still shockable. They show here Theresa, and Ronelle, all these couples, Stephen and Linda. Of course, she's 47 and he's 30. They all have multiple partners, they all switch-hit, they are all AC/DC, they are dual- gaited. I remember all the cute words in New York, and, after all, I grew up in Manhattan and then west to Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, so I know all the flippant dialog. {time} 1345 Here is a woman, 48, with a young Hispanic guy, it looks like he is about 17, 18, 19; he is in his early 20's. Freud said we are all bisexual. He thought that exclusive heterosexuality was a problem. In the copy it says that he thought homosexuality was a problem, and he never got around to that, because he died and met God before he had a chance to get into that. But the article goes on, and by its commentary, approving of this fifth gender. Bella Abzug stands up in Beijing, China, in the middle of the world's most oppressive human rights, communistic dictatorship and mentions homophobia and gets a standing ovation from all of the assembled feminists of the world. if Ms. Hillary was in the room, she would have given her a standing ovation. So here in the picture of this blue-eyed, red-headed guy, Tim, 24, with Ellen, 30 years of age. She has done it all, it is always older women and younger guys in these bisexual things. Listen to this. ``The bisexual blip of the 1970's was an offshoot of the sexual revolution.'' Of course, Newsweek's position is the sexual revolution was just grand. Tell that to 200,000 people dead of AIDS, another million infected in this country, and 10 to 20 million affected all around the world. Make love, casual sex like alley cats, not war. So they refer to the sexual revolution in an approving way. ``The bisexual blip was an offshoot of that revolution. It was straight with a twist. By contrast, the current bisexual movement rises from the gay and feminists movements.'' Notice it did not say lesbian wing of the feminist movement, just the feminist movement. ``For a generation that came of age during the gay rights movement, same-sex relationships or experiments no longer carry the stigma they once did.'' Stigma. What would that mean? Would that mean sin? Right and wrong, evil, banal sin, mortal sin? Newsweek magazine, with this article, Mr. Speaker, and anybody listening, make no mistake about it, Newsweek magazine, with this July 17 cover story, is a direct frontal attack on everything that I was ever taught by my parents, by every teacher I had in grade school, high school, and college. It is a direct frontal assault on Mother Theresa, on Pope John Paul II, on Billy Graham, or every Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish theologian in this Nation. It is a frontal assault on Moses, right before my eyes, on the Jewish rabbi and great lawgiver Mimones over here; it is a frontal assault on the justice code of almost all of the 23 men whose medallions you see up in this Chamber: The Pope, Pope Innocent, Pope Gregory, St. Louis, Pope Alphonse. It is an assault upon every moral code in this country, but it says, there is no more stigma to promiscuity and groping around like alley cats, and any drug- infested party you can go to, and it gets worse. No longer a stigma. Get this next line. I hope you are watching, Evan Thomas. If my office is listening, Mr. Speaker, I hope they call Newsweek because he is in his office this afternoon, and ask Evan Thomas to please turn on the television and listen to this. This is not in quotes, this is Newsweek writing, this is John Leland writing, with the help, and I am going to mention him right now, of Steve Rhodes, contributing in Chicago, Peter Katel in Miami, Claudia Kalb and Marc Peyser in New York, Nadine Joseph in San Francisco, and Martha Brant in Washington, in the Washington office and bureau reports. Get this next line, after there is no stigma: ``More and more of us-- at work * * *'' Is this Newsweek people at work?--at school, in our families, and [[Page H 8718]] in our entertainments--``move comfortably between gay and straight worlds.'' ``Most of us in our work move comfortably between gay and straight worlds and in our schools?'' Then they go to a quote: ``Those of us who are younger,'' says Rebecca Kaplan, 24, a psychology major at Massachusetts Institute of Technology--what are your SAT scores to get into MIT? She says, ``those of us who are younger owe a great deal to gays, lesbians and bisexuals who came before us.'' Who came before us? That is a line for George Washington in his inaugural speech, April 30, 1789. We owe this to Benjamin Franklin and to George Mason up here, we owe it to them, Thomas Payne and those who came before us, those who died at Lexington and Concord, those who suffered during the six and a half years of the Revolutionary War. Any African-American can say, we owe this to those who died in the conflict, to the terrorist John Brown and his sons, we owe it to everybody who came before us, our freedom. What was the greatest scene in the wonderful movie, ``Glory,'' when Morgan Freeman says to the young rebel Denzel Washington, he says, white boys have anted up and died for our freedom; now it is our time to ante up, and he rallies the 4th regiment to go against Fort Wagner, and they gave their lives in the fight for freedom to keep this country. As it says here, tolerance, liberty and union on the other side, those who went before us. ``The bisexuals, lesbians who went before us, we owe it to them.'' She is going to make a great psychologist. Still in school at age 24. She says, ``because of them,'' Rebecca continues, ``I was able to come out as a bisexual and not hate myself.'' Here is this word feminism again, not the lesbian branch of feminism. Feminism has also made romantic attachments between two women--either provisional or lasting-- more acceptable, even privileged. Do you know that I had to be a Congressman approaching my sixties before a young graduate of Holyoke told me that the majority of women at that college would say they were lesbians? That she had to form on campus a heterosexual club to defend themselves. They were not just defending virginity, they were defending normal heterosexuality. And she said, of course, most of the women are 4-year lesbians, or more accurately a 3-year, 9-month lesbian. Peer pressure, sexual lesbian experimentation, and then as, some radical lesbians have said, dripping bile from their lips, they have said, and then the sisters betray us, not in this order necessarily, and go out and get themselves a dog, a station wagon, children and a husband. Is that what Newsweek means by provisional lesbians? Just while they were in college, at a school of higher learning, one of the privileged of the world, to get advanced education beyond high school? Then it says, after privileged, ``as president of the National Organization for Women, Patricia Ireland sets a quiet example.'' She is a big mouth, so what does quiet mean? ``She has both a husband and a female companion.'' What kind of a wimp is her husband down there in Miami that he lets her keep a lesbian roommate up there in Washington, DC. where she does the work of NOW, preparing to send Bella Abzug to rant on in Beijing, China about homophobia? Incredible. And there were some people at NOW that voted against the Nation's most famous lesbian becoming head of NOW. Now, this in Newsweek, and this is in quotes, ``Namely every college or university in the country and some high schools now have gay and lesbian student centers; sex with one's own gender, for anyone who is curious,'' that is you, Mr. Speaker, that is everybody in the gallery, that is these two staffers sitting here, that is our pages, that is me, ``for anyone who is curious, section with one's own gender is now a visible and protected part of campus culture.'' And protected by Newsweek, ladies and gentlemen. Queer studies. I thought queer was a politically incorrect word. ``Queer studies and gender studies are now part of the national curriculum. A popular T- shirt spotted recently in a Connecticut high school puts it this way: Do not assume I am straight.'' That is a high school kid. ``As one 17 year old bi says,'' we do not know if it is a boy or girl, 17 year old, someone over 18 rapes a 17-year-old young lady on a date, that is a statutory rape. This is a minor child that Newsweek is writing about. ``A 17-year-old minor bi says `It is not us versus them anymore. There is just more and more of us.' '' Tim Horing, but there is an umlaut--I did not know Newsweek's typewriters had umlauts over the 0--21, a sophomore--why is he a sophomore at 21? He should be a senior or junior--at City College in San Francisco, describes himself as ``typical of bisexual youth. We just refuse to label ourselves as any of the five food groups.'' That is male heterosexual, female heterosexual, male homosexual, female homosexual, and the bi's. ``We do not want to be any part of the five. We revel in the fuzziness, in the blurred images. Working class, Roman Catholic,'' and, oh, does the New York Times and the networks as CBS did in their CBS reports last night, do they love to attack Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor and the Roman Catholic Church, if they get a Catholic or practicing Baptist family or an orthodox Jewish family, oh, to get somebody from a traditional Jewish or Roman Catholic to switch over and talk about how they are a recovering Catholic or a recovering Jewish person, because of all that terrible confirmation and Holy Communion and bar mitzvah and bat mitzvah, oh, they love to get one of this. And get this, Tom's father is a retired New York narcotics cop. A narco guy taking away another one of their flesh privileges, to get high and then grope out boy for all the warm flesh. ``Horing had his first sexual fantasies about the Bionic Woman, and then in his teens he admitted to himself in a series of difficult steps that he was also attracted to men. He came out to a few friends in school, and at his graduation when his name was called, Timothy Horing, six rows in the auditorium mischievously,'' no, not mischievously, ``yelled out `The bisexual; Tim Horing, the bisexual.' A surprise to his parents.'' No, a gut-ripping heart seizure for his New York retired narcotics cop and his Roman Catholic mother. ``For the most part, he has been in monogamous relationships.'' You like that, ``for the most part?'' ``Usually with men.'' Oh, I see. I always said for my entire life that bisexuality was basically a cover story for homosexuality. That when they captured the adjective ``gay'' to say that they were happier than your average pair, more cheerful, more mirthful, that then, if they said they were bisexual, they could say ``Well, I date the whole base. I can date anybody on Capitol Hill. I am a switch-hitter. I am AC-DC, I am bi. I can go for anything. You are missing out on half the world.'' But we find out he basically dates men. As we go all the way through this, most of it is male homosexuality, not bisexuality. Though he is now dating two gay men and a bisexual woman. I see. He is spreading himself around. Two homosexual men and one half-homosexual woman. What would that give him in the rating of chess pieces? What would that make him, 87.75 homosexual? He says, young Tom, ``I never wanted a white picket fence, but I do want someone I can settle down with and raise my Benetton kids.'' Benetton. Is that the Benetton Colors out of Italy that put Ronald Reagan in major news magazines with cancer, sarcoma, AIDS sores all over his face? Is this Benetton that pushes homosexual money into every corner of America and everywhere else their clothing is marketed? I notice that the Justice Department today under Janet Reno is investigating Calvin Klein jeans to see if they used underaged children in their soft core pornography, latest wave of disgusting ads, and Klein, unless he gets taken to court, is laughing all the way to the bank again, because negative soft- or hard-core pornography sells in modern America. They just had an adult bookstore convention in the Sheraton Universal Hotel in Los Angeles, and I am reading in one of my Los Angeles Times clippings that the business, in spite of the January 17 earthquake 2 years ago, has rebounded and doubled. You do not see porno theaters in your markets anymore, because it is in all the hotels for traveling businessmen to demean somebody else's sister, wife, somebody else's daughter, who did not have the [[Page H 8719]] love of a father, and it is in all the video stores, including Blockbuster. The ripping apart of these young gals from these transitional neighborhoods who never new the loving touch, the moral touch, of a father, to hug them and kiss them and guide them through school. They are out there as the young whores of our society being used by the porno industry. And no matter how many commit suicide like Karen Applegate from a beautiful little town in Wisconsin.--I have spoken to her mother. No matter how many kill themselves. Six playmates have killed themselves over the years. When I asked Hugh Hefner that once to his face, he turned red and did not want to discuss it and said it was a lie. I knew them each by name, starting with Marilyn Monroe, his first playmate. {time} 1400 But this guy says he wants to raise his Benetton kids in a swinging orgy household. His partner may be a man or woman, he says. I don't feel forced to choose. I don't have to make any tough choices. Then it shows this very pathetic human being with his baby. He has gone through every orgy situation available to the humankind. And when people ask him what his little baby is, man or woman, he says ask the baby. He has a little boy or girl and he says, ask the baby. Smart aleck. Pray for him. He is 42 and he has three or four people on the hook. It goes on and on as it gets worse. Softening tensions. Softening tensions. This is Newsweek. That is a paragraph title. For many bisexuals, it has not been easy. When I came out in '88, says Melissa Merry, 31, energetic Chicagoan who calls herself Mel: I was told by people from local lesbian support groups not to come out as a bisexual or I would be asked to leave. They did not want the fence straddling. Well, when I got to some of these paragraphs about high schools, the first thing that flashed in my mind, as an Irish-American, was William B. Yeats poem read when Hitler started World War II. And he died that year, Yeats. It is called ``The Second Coming,'' about the beast being born, the Antichrist and slouching off to Bethlehem to be born. Those are the last lines, but it begins turning and turning in the widening gyre, as in gyrations, falcons, circle. Turning and turning in the widening gyre, the falcon no longer hears the falconer. Things fall apart. The center cannot hold. Everywhere the blood din tide is loosed. Everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned. The ceremony of innocence is drowned by Newsweek. The best lack all conviction and the worst are full of passionate intensity. There is an intensity to this article and it is evil and it is the worst. When I saw in here they are claiming James Dean, the actor who died at age 24 after only three movies, when I see they are claiming Marlene Dietrich as a bisexual lesbian, and Cary Grant, my favorite actor as a young man because of everybody's favorite movie quote-unquote ``Gunga Din,'' when I saw that, I went to the end to see how many women participated in--what is the author's name again, with John Leland in this disgusting, vile piece--and while I was back at the tail end of the article reading all the violence--by the way, if this were in Time we would not know who contributed to this. I could not call any of these people and say have you lost your moral compass totally at this magazine? Does Donald Graham read this, this cover story of this corruption, this drowning of innocence? And as I was reading, I decided I would look before I finished the story at the last line. Now, let me tell you a story about myself personally. When I was a young man in Beverly Hills, just out of high school, and I heard these rumors, because my uncle is the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz, Jack Haley, I grew up in that community. I knew who dodged the draft. I knew the heroes who went off to combat, like James Stewart and Tyrone Power. We know who all the ones that were rumored to be homosexuals. I knew about Rock Hudson 10 years before it came out in the press. I had a small bit part in a movie ``Gathering of Eagles,'' and he minced across the set and the director said cut. And Rock turned around and said was I mincing too much? And the director said, just do it again, Rock. I witnessed that, and everybody talks behind the scenes. Just as in fashion design, in ice skating, in supernumeraries, on Broadway stage, in ballet, and now in some parts of government there is a larger percentage than the 1 percent of homosexuals out there across America. And when I worked on the sets of Hollywood trying to feed my five children and dreaming about running for Congress someday, I had long philosophical discussions with a lot of young homosexual men in their 20's, and they would tell me about Rock and all the stars that they just were dying to get with some night; wanted them, and then to see them up there 50 feet high up on the silver screen and know that you had sexually been with them. What a trip. And how did I rationalize Cary Grant when I was in high school? I remember working out a rationale that when God gives you a lot of talent and you make a lot of money in your 20's or 30's--what did Robin Williams say after he came off cocaine and watched his friend John Belushi die? He said cocaine is God's way of telling you you are making too much money. It was the same way in Hollywood. Always has been. Or in any profession where money flows fast into the hands of the young. Look at all our rock stars. Look at Kurt Cobain blowing his brains out. Look at Jerry Garcia. Look at Marilyn Monroe. Look at Elvis. Look at Jimi Hendrix. Look at Jim Morrison. Look at Janis Joplin. Whether it is booze or heroin or drugs, and orgies for all of them. I watched Elvis Presley using his staff to pimp for him. I thought what a tragedy for this polite young man from Tupelo, MI. I am trying to sell him a script called the 101st American, about Vietnam, because he had served honorably in the Army, and I am watching his staff hit on young pretty extra girls for him. They rented a big mansion up in Beverly Hills below the head of the owner of the L.A. Rams, who is now dead, and you could hear the orgies going on all night long. He died naked, on drugs at 42 years of age, and now you can get a postage stamp and lick Elvis and stick him on your letter and say there went the most talented man in rock singing in our lifetime dead at 42. And in that suite of stamps you can get Marilyn Monroe. Do we forget how old she was in August of 1962 when she died? 36 years old. 36 years old! At my age, that is a kid. We are celebrating these two deaths with their most glamorous picture. Remember the debate in the Post Office department: Do we want the fat, older drug besotted Elvis or the younger Elvis in his prime? We picked the younger one. And he was a polite young man. What a tragedy! So I watched all these people corrupting themselves, and I watched others, like Jimmy Stewart and my Uncle Jack and others. I remember Danny Thomas telling me I have never told a dirty joke in my life, Bob. Do not ever forget that. My uncle told me, never stoop to dirty humor on the stage. It is too easy to get laughs. Today I watch all these comedians. It is a category with the medical word for male organ. That is all they do, are jokes on genitalia. It is sickening what is going on in Hollywood. But what was my rationale for Cary Grant? Here it was, I remember it vividly, I was in my teens. I said when you have too much money, and you can have any beautiful woman in the world, and you start going to wild Hollywood parties and drinking too much--we did not know about drugs much in those days--and you start drinking too much, and you are at an orgy, whatever moves, I guess. It is all a mortal sin. It is all promiscuity. It is all flesh. Flesh is flesh, so you experiment with everything. So I do not think Cary Grant was a homosexual or a bisexual. He just got carried away at those orgies. That was my rationale so I could like Sergeant McChesney of Gunga Din with McLaglen and with Sergeant Ballentine Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Years later, in a debate running for the Senate seat that Pete Wilson eventually won, I am debating one of the candidates back in the pack, because I am still back in the pack in the Presidential race, he was a State senator, he was raised as a German-American [[Page H 8720]] Roman Catholic, he was a colonel in the Marine Reserve, and I pointed out to him in a radio debate in 1982 at a station in Pasadena, KRLA-- how is that for a memory--I said, you know something my State Senate friend, reaching out and grabbing any kind of flesh, whether heterosexual or homosexual, lust is lust. It is one of the seven deadly sins. It is all a mortal sin whether normal or abnormal. He went ballistic. Would not accept that. Then I found out he had a scandal brewing. He had two college students where he taught as a professor, a marine officer, who were pregnant with children out of wedlock. He bragged, quite properly, at least he was pro-life. I could not understand why he took such exception to saying that God is not going to judge a promiscuous homosexual any more harshly than he will judge a promiscuous heterosexual. It is all lust. It is all the ceremony of innocence being drowned as we do this to our children. So there it is, when I am a teenager rationalizing Cary Grant and arguing on a radio show in a California Senate race in 1982. Here is my point for telling those two little tangential tales. My eyes jump above all the bylines of these people, Steve and Peter and Claudia and Mark and Nadine and Martha, and here is the last line of this disgusting, vile, decadent piece from the Graham empire of the Washington Post Newsweek magazine and other small newspapers. It says in the last paragraph, in San Francisco recently Tim Horing-- remember him, Roman Catholic, parents retired New York narco cop father--he was telling his friends about how he changed his approach to picking up boys. How old was Horing? 21. Hey, Newsweek, did you slip here in your investigative reporting? Telling his friends how he had changed his approach to pick up boys? Is he a 21-year-old chicken hawk hitting on runaway young men on the street who also, in most cases, until recently, when peer pressure overwhelms even good attentive Jewish Christian mothers and fathers. In the old days, last year, last decade, it was young boys who never knew a father's masculine touch, a mother's hug, a mom or dad taking them to a baseball game or fishing. It was young men who ran away from inattentive alcoholic families that ended up on the street of once glamorous Hollywood Boulevard to be preyed upon, P-R-E-Y-E-D upon, to be taken off for porno films and turned into midnight cowboy male street whores all along Selma Boulevard behind beautiful Jesuit Blessed Sacrament Church in Hollywood. I drove down that street when I did Michael Reagan's show a month ago, and there they are, still huddling in the driveways with less business because now most of them are infected with AIDS. So Tim Horing--I have to check if he was 21. Yes, he is 21. He says the boys that I pick up now--he has changed his approach. ``I used to say are you queer? Then I switched to, do you like boys? Now his favorite line is, do you like me?'' As he sees it, ``I have gone from the political to the historical attraction to the very personal. All that matters is if they like me.'' This is the new bisexual moment, Newsweek says. This is their close in a nutshell. And I close with this line, Mr. Speaker. ``Hard fought, hard thought, and distinctively individual. It is a thorny narrative, fraught with questions of identity and belonging. And in the end, it is really about the simple, mysterious pull between warm human bodies when the lights go out.'' My teenage rationale for Cary Grant. We are in advanced moral decay, Mr. Speaker, and I am going to stay in the Presidential race as long as I can, because there is not anyone in the race like Congressman Robert K. Dornan at age 62. \": 'target_text',\n",
       " \"BOSNIA Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, earlier today Bosnia was discussed on the floor here. I wish to make a few remarks in that regard in the time allotted in morning business, because I think there is a great deal that is misunderstood about the peace process and our involvement in it and what our relationship is to the talks going on in Dayton. When we talk about the House, they had a lot of discussion in the House, and, of course, they had their vote over there, against any involvement in this or against going in militarily. But what has to be agreed to before we even get involved in any way, what has to be agreed to, is a complete peace agreement. It has to be agreed to, and not only agreed to but the firing has to have stopped before we move in. There are those who, apparently, assume we are going to have to fight our way in to establish peace and establish a peace as Tito did during the only period in modern history where there has been peace in Yugoslavia. That was a militarily imposed peace on the whole country. That is not the kind of peace we are talking about. There have to be two conditions met. First, there has to be an agreement. It has to be airtight. It has to be extremely detailed. It has to define exactly what the borders are. It has to define exactly which town is in what sector and what they have agreed to and signed up and said will be the new formation of those cities, those newly emerging countries in that area. So that agreement they are trying to work out in Dayton right now has to be in that fine a detail. It cannot be just a peace agreement that says we will move in and we hope we can establish peace. ``Yes, United States and NATO, you come and we know this will all work out.'' It is not that kind of agreement they are working toward. If I thought it was that kind of agreement, I would not be supporting this process whatsoever. What they are talking about is a very, very detailed agreement-- specific borders. Will this orchard be on this side? Whose territory will it be in? Will the next farm be in somebody else's territory? Will the road junction be in whose territory? That is the kind of detail they are trying to work out on huge maps out there in Dayton. I would say, it will be uphill at best that there will be any agreement coming out of that. I am still of the opinion that it is probably 60-40 against our ever being involved over there, because I doubt the parties will be able to come to that kind of definitive outline on a map as to who has what in their territory. It has to be that way or we should not get involved. Second, the firing has to have stopped. The firing has to have ceased. Obviously, the next question is, then, if they have that kind of commitment to peace, which they say they have, and that is the reason they are in Dayton talking, and they have come to a definitive peace agreement and firing has stopped, why does anybody need to go in? We were over there recently, just 1 month ago this weekend. Four weeks ago this weekend I was part of the Senator Stevens' Codel over there. We were briefed by our military leadership and by our people and U.N. people in Zagreb and Croatia. We flew into Sarajevo for a period of time, along with 21,000 pounds of peas on a C-130, and out again. We spent about half a day, which does not make us experts in that area, but it was interesting to see it, anyway. Then we came back through Brussels and talked to our Ambassadors there. But, when we were there, what we were so impressed with was there is a desire for peace. That is what has started this whole thing. The parties themselves say they are tired of war. The parties themselves say they want peace but are unable to get it. If we have the agreement and we have the cease-fire, why do we need to go? Here are the facts we were told while we were over there. It is estimated that about 20 to 50 percent of the people involved in the fighting there are what they call the irregulars. They are not people who are part of a regular, organized military militia that accepts commands from above or from Belgrade or anyplace else. They are people who are the irregulars. They are the farmers who are out cutting hay one day. They go up to the lines, up to the next village where there is a battle going on, they take a rifle from someone, they are in the lines for 3 or 4 days while someone else goes back to cut their hay. They are the people who, in the 30-some cease-fires that there have been over there so far, they are the ones who have violated the cease-fire because they basically do not take orders from anyone in particular. So the firing starts again, it spreads, and we have had 30- some cease-fires that have not worked. The fighting starts again. What is contemplated, and what our role would be over there--if we go in, if there is the airtight agreement, if the firing has stopped--then there would be zones set up between the parties along these borders, well-defined borders, where there would be 2- to 4-kilometer width areas in this that would be patrolled or would be monitored by the NATO forces, of which we would be about one-third of the total NATO force. I do not see that as being bad in that situation. Now, if there is firing by these irregulars or anyone else, we would put it down immediately. We would hope, because of the massive show of force we are putting in there, there would be no firing. If there is, it would be put down and put down immediately. It would be by NATO rules of engagement, not the U.N. rules of engagement. They are more of a debating society than anything else. But NATO rules of engagement say if you are fired on, you can obliterate that source. I asked General [[Page S 17448]] Joulwan, would we be permitted to take out anybody who fired on any of the NATO forces? Absolutely. That is key to the whole thing. Will there be any risk? I suppose there is. We have already had three people killed over there when we had Frasure, Kruzel, and Drew, who were in a vehicle that slid off the road and they were killed in the wreck. That is tragic. Our hearts go out to their families on this. I knew one of the gentlemen, Mr. Kruzel, in particular. It is a terrible thing that anybody is killed in a situation like this. But will there be any danger of accidents like that, or maybe somebody getting killed? There might be. But I would also point out we do not withdraw the Peace Corps from overseas, and the Peace Corps in its history has had 224 people who have died overseas. I was surprised it was that high a number. I would have thought it would have been a very, very few, but the Peace Corps lost 224 people so far, to this date, since its inception. Like the old saying in aviation, ``How do you have complete, 100 percent aviation safety? You keep all the airplanes in the hangar. You do not risk them.'' Yet we know how much good we have done around the world by being involved to some extent. We have a Christian-Judeo heritage of helping people, alleviating suffering around the world. We supply food, we send out AID programs. Of course, we cannot solve all the world's problems, either with peaceful organizations or with the military. But I think an American leadership in the world has been such a force for good, I would hate to see us go back to trying to be an isolationist America. I repeat once again, we have to have an agreement, airtight. The firing has to have stopped. Then we go in with minimal risk, with our NATO allies, to try to keep that peace that has been eluding them so far, basically because of the irregulars who do not honor these cease- fires. Our leadership is important. We restored democracy in Haiti. In the process of doing that, of leading, we have been involved in bringing peace to the Middle East, working on it in Northern Ireland, we see Russian nuclear weapons are no longer aimed at our people. We secured the indefinite extension of a Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which was a big step forward. We achieved real progress toward a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. We reached an agreement with North Korea to end its nuclear weapons program. These are products of American leadership, and that is just a little, partial list. We have seen democracies growing in South America because of our involvement there. I think the risk over there, in that Bosnian area, if it is done pursuant to a well-thought-out agreement and a cease-fire, and we go in with a preponderance of force that people understand is going to be used if they break the peace and if they fire--to me is well worth the risk. Much has been made out of the fact that we want to provide leadership for NATO. I agree with that. I think our membership in NATO is very important. But that is not just the reason why we go in. That is pointed to, sometimes, as the reason we go in, in effect saying, ``There go our NATO people. We better rush out and lead them, because we are the biggest factor in NATO.'' I will not agree with that. NATO has to be right. Let us judge this on whether it is right to go in, or wrong to go in, and try to get peace in that area where peace has not taken root for so long, and where some of the actions that have happened there in the past have literally been the sparks that set off two world wars. So, if we can bring peace to that area, to me it is well worth the risk. NATO leadership, I think, is, important, and NATO has been looked at by too many Americans, I believe, as just some sort of a remnant of the cold war, and let us forget it and move out of NATO. Is it still important? I do believe NATO is important. It is important. NATO leadership is what is moving us into the organization for security and cooperation in Europe working with the European Union. We have a Partnership for Peace, which is in its fledgling days but becoming more and more important. The North Atlantic Cooperation Council was formed in 1991. That is moving ahead, and really is a good force for peace in that part of the world. We are the biggest factor in NATO. I think it is important that we retain that. But I do not see our leadership of NATO as just being the only reason we should move into that particular area. I know my time is up. Do not forget for 1 minute that we have to have an airtight agreement. We have to have a cease-fire, and on that basis we move in to try to give peace a chance in that very, very tough area of the world. I yield the floor. Several Senators addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are in morning business under a 10-minute rule. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President I wanted to respond to the Senator from Rhode Island and some others today. I found his remarks to be particularly interesting and helpful, and, as is often the case, I find myself agreeing with a fair amount of what he says. He is sensible, and moderate, which is probably difficult for many these days. I saw a cartoon recently in which someone was pointing at someone else and saying ``There is no room for moderates here.'' The fact is that there is a lot of room for moderates. There are moderates in both political parties who generally do not view things from the extremes and who want to solve problems. I hope we will find a way, using some common sense, to engage in an attempt to find solutions to some of the vexing problems we have in this country. The Senator from Georgia was on the floor talking about trash television a few moments ago. My sense is that people in this country are concerned about two principal areas, and he hit on one of those. One is economic security. The fact is that many Americans are having more trouble finding a job, and many others are finding that their wages are declining. Sixty percent of American families are working harder for less money and are losing income. This means less economic security. I think people are very concerned about that. They are also concerned about the diminution of values--the lowering of standards in this country. And part of that relates to trash television and violence on television. We can do something about some of these things, but not all of them. We must address some of the issues in the home and in the community. But some of these problems represent public policy areas as well. In the area of economic security, one of the things that is often discussed--and one that I agree with--is that we have to put our fiscal house in order at some point. We cannot continue to run enormous debts year after year. We cannot spend money we do not have forever. I would not have a problem if next year we spent $400 billion we did not have--and therefore incur a deficit next year of $400 billion--if with that $400 billion we cured cancer just like that. I would say that was a pretty good investment. You amortize that over the next 40, 50, 70 years, and it would be worth paying off the $400 billion deficit incurred to cure cancer. But that is not what these deficits are about. These are systemic deficits in the operating budgets of this country. You cannot continue that. You must address it. That is why I said last evening that I commend the majority party for a reconciliation bill that contains some things that are good. It contains some awful things as well, and I think some bad priorities. I am glad the President is going to veto it. I do not support it. But it has a good number of things that make a lot of sense. There are a good number of things in that reconciliation bill that both sides would agree to. But there are some major elements of the reconciliation bill that must be changed because, as we address the deficit in this country--and ultimately we must do it together--we must find a compromise. We should not ask the portion of the American people who have the least to bear the biggest burden of all the spending cuts, and then turn to the small portion of those who [[Page S 17449]] have the most and give them the largest share of the tax cuts. We have to try to fix some of those things. With respect to where we are today, the shutdown ought to end. The reconciliation bill is passed. The President is going to veto it. Negotiations, in my judgment, ought to begin immediately to try to find a solution to the impasse and a solution to the reconciliation bill. The question ought not be whether we have a reconciliation bill. The question is not whether we address the budget deficit and lead to a balanced budget. The question is, how do we do that? Not whether, but how? There is no good reason, in my judgment, to have a continued government shutdown. There is no juice left in that lemon for anybody-- not for any political party, and not for any political leader. This shutdown does not make any sense. I probably contribute to some of the concerns about the language that has been used during the shutdown. I read on the floor statements by the Speaker of the House, who in April said, ``We are going to create a titanic standoff and shut down the Government.'' Those are the facts. However, I am not saying that only one party is at fault here. The fact is that there is lots of room for blame. There has been lots of language uttered in these past few days that has caused a lot of chaos in the political system. But we find ourselves in a circumstance where we have people who say it is either our way or it is no way. If you do not do it our way, we will shut the Government down. The fact is Government works by consent. This is a democracy. For 200 years we have had impasses over wars, over depressions, over dozens and dozens of vexing, troublesome issues. The way those impasses have been solved is that people with good will, with common sense, have come together and said, ``Let us reason. Let us find a way to meet the goal, to work out this problem together.'' I want to mention a couple of things that were in the reconciliation bill which causes a lot of problems. Medicare--do we need to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare and Medicaid? Yes, we do. Not just in Medicare and Medicaid but in the price of health care generally for families, for businesses, for governments. The price of health care, the escalation of health care costs year after year somehow has to be addressed. But no one can any longer believe that what is in this reconciliation bill will address the price escalation in Medicare by saying to senior citizens you will have the same quality health care and you will not pay more for it. Everyone understands this approach means senior citizens will get less and pay more. The tax cut--many of us feel very strongly that the facts show every dollar of this tax cut will be borrowed. I would love to have somebody come and explain why that is not true. Regrettably, it is true. Every dollar of the proposed $245 billion tax cut will be borrowed and will add to the national debt, which adds to the burden of those children we have been talking about. On the car radio on the way in this morning, I heard a woman who had called the radio to talk about the shutdown. She said both of her parents, regrettably, have to go to a nursing home, one because of Alzheimer's and one who had a stroke. They have been there 5 years and started out with an asset base of $400,000 to $600,000. Now much of that is gone. She called and said, ``My worry is for when their assets are gone--and I believe that their assets should be used to pay for their care--my parents will not have an entitlement to Medicaid.'' When their assets are gone, under this new proposal, they will not have guaranteed coverage under Medicaid. That will be up to the States. Maybe the States will decide that nursing home care is an entitlement for her parents. Maybe not. She was worried about that. That is a significant change. That was in this budget reconciliation bill. I mentioned last evening the differences in spending priorities that have been talked about and for which the CR was fought over this weekend--cuts of 40 percent out of a little program called Star Schools; only $25 million is spent on Star Schools and that will be cut by 40 percent. The bill the Senate passed the other day, which I voted against, doubles the amount of money spent on star wars despite the fact that is was not requested by the Pentagon. I think these priorities are wrong. I do not say that in a pejorative way. I say that in my judgment we can do a lot better for this country than those priorities. I mentioned yesterday that in this thick reconciliation plan, there are two little things buried--among dozens and dozens--that I bet nobody in the Chamber knew about. One is a provision to repeal the alternative minimum tax provisions we put in place in 1986. That little thing that nobody knows about means that 2,000 corporations will receive $7 million each in tax cuts. Let me say that again: 2,000 corporations will receive a tax cut of $7 million each. Another little provision is labeled 956(A). I bet no one in the Chamber knows what it is. Well, it deals with the repeal of the circumstance of deferral with respect to income that is deferred for tax purposes by foreign subsidiaries of American corporations. They have the money over there. Now, we have certain passive rules that say you have to repatriate the money you pay taxes on. This little nugget in here says we are going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to tell those companies that have moved jobs overseas, moved jobs out of this country: By the way, we are going to reward you even more for it. Those things do not make any sense. We ought not vote for a bill that includes things like that. I bet there is no one in the Senate who knew that provision was in that plan. I am talking about a couple little provisions--there are dozen and dozens and dozens of those little nuggets-- that say to big interests, special interests: Guess what? It is time to smile. We are offering up to you an enormous reward at a time when we say to kids, we do not have room for you in the Head Start Program; at a time when we say to kids benefiting from the Star Schools Program that we are sorry, you are going to have to cut back. My point is that this debate is about priorities and choices. All of us, it seems to me, in the coming days can do better. And I stand here as one who says let us balance the budget. Let us do it the right way. Let us all engage in debate about choices and agree. Seven years is just fine with me. In fact, we could do it within 5 if the Federal Reserve Board will take the boot off the neck of Americans and allow us a little economic growth. But let us discuss it together--the Senator from Rhode Island is absolutely right--use some common sense and do the right thing for this country. Mr. President, I thank you for your indulgence. I yield the floor. \": 'target_text',\n",

       " \"DEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996 The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill. Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas. Amendment No. 2843 Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I hope we can dispose of the pending amendment in short order. The committee reviewed all of these programs that the amendment proposes to fund. These are all of the so-called prevention programs that, when we debated this bill, we discussed at great length. What is being proposed here is to give money to the States for activities such as midnight basketball, and to pay for it by cutting the $80 million from the FBI. I remind my colleagues that when we passed the Anti-Terrorism Act, we authorized additional funding for the FBI. What I have tried to do in this bill is to provide some of that funding which we authorized. What we are being asked to do here is to go back and fund the very programs that we passed over because we did not think they were worthy, and we are being asked to pay for them by cutting the FBI. I think that if people could take a look at this amendment and decide whether they wanted these prevention programs or whether they wanted the money to go into law enforcement to grab violent criminals by the throat and not let them go to get a better grip, I think it would be a very clear choice. I am opposed to the amendment. I would be happy to have a voice vote on the amendment if the Senator is willing to do that. Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I will call for a rollcall vote, but I want to answer briefly what the Senator said. The FBI this coming year is funded at a 15-percent increase over last year. There is not a single request the FBI has made for funding that we have not authorized and are prepared to fund, without--without--this $80 million. This $80 million is over and above everything that the FBI has authorized, the President has requested and the House has funded. He talks about midnight basketball league, and that is a synonym for money that we think is wasted on prevention. As Senator Cohen pointed out, this money is block granted to States. They do not have to spend it on midnight basketball. We have decided that much of the money we are spending at the Federal level the States can spend much more effectively. You have made that argument time and time again. Let the Governors, let the local government spend the money, not Washington. That is what these crime prevention programs are aimed at. These crime prevention programs, if the Governors so wish, could be spent on programs like DARE. Everyone in this Chamber understands and recognizes that DARE is a program that works. So midnight basketball is not where these funds are going to be expended. They are going to be given to States and Governors and local governments to spend as they see fit. Again, the argument is that in any crimefighting bill, a certain amount of money, modest as it is, needs to be spent on trying to prevent it from occurring in the first place, and I do not think that there are any Senators, or many Senators in this Chamber who would not agree with this principle. And that is all this amendment intends to do. Several Senators addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, $80 million will be spent here by this amendment, our distinguished colleague talks about letting the States spend it, but we are not taking it away from Federal midnight basketball, we are not taking it away from Federal prevention programs. We are taking the money away from the FBI. We passed an antiterrorism bill by a vote of 91 to 8 authorizing funds for the FBI. All I have tried to do in this bill is to provide part of that funding. What we would be doing here is cutting the FBI to fund programs that may or may not do anything to prevent crime. The intentions of the program may be good. There are people who are strong proponents, for example, of midnight basketball. The point is, do we want to cut the FBI to fund it? I say no. I think this amendment should be rejected and it should be rejected soundly. Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. First of all, this is not about midnight basketball. That is a great thing to talk about. The States are not using this for midnight basketball. Let me tell you what they are using it for, to give you one example. I can pick almost any one of your States. The thing States use this money for, for example, is boys clubs and girls clubs. Let me tell you about boys clubs and girls clubs. There is a study the Judiciary Committee did and it has been done by others, and no one disputes it. If you put in a boys club and girls club--the study was done in Chicago and New York--you take two housing projects, the same type of housing projects, and put a boys club and girls club in the basement of one and no boys club and girls club in the basement of the other, the difference in the rate of crime is as follows: 31 percent fewer arrests in the project that has a boys club and girls club in it; 27 [[Page S 14646]] percent less use of drugs, arrest for drugs; and 19 percent fewer arrests for any acts of violence. As my dear old mother would say, an idle mind is a devil's workshop. You put these kids out there, and you have nothing for them. Let me tell you what these boys and girls clubs do with the money we have in here. One example: There is not a single one of these clubs that has midnight basketball. I will tell you what they have. They have the following deal: If you join the club and you are involved--and particularly, they put them in housing projects, which they are now doing in most of your States, putting in public housing projects. What they are required to do is to have computer classes before they can play in the gym. Second, they are required in a State like mine, and many of yours, to have mentoring programs. They bring the mentoring programs into the schools. Of the people who volunteer in the boys and girls clubs, 80 percent are uniformed police officers. Third, what they do is they get these kids into these programs, and part of the requirement to stay in the program and to be able to use the boys and girls club is you have to stay in school and have passing grades. What they have done is changed the culture in those communities. I will give you one example by limiting it to boys and girls clubs. YMCAs and church groups are all involved in these programs. We are not talking about midnight basketball. Second, we are talking about the weed and seed program, which started under President Bush. I can pick 50 quotes. I will pick one from a Republican U.S. Attorney from Georgia, Joe Whitley, former U.S. Attorney from the northern district of Georgia: I have said that this is the most important matter I have ever dealt with as U.S. Attorney. It's a simple but fundamentally sound idea that people in communities really seem to believe. . . . The program is responsive to the concerns of citizens. It's positive because residents thought it had real and credibility--combining law enforcement and prevention. I can talk about Michael Chertoff, former U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, a Republican, and Debra Daniels, former U.S. Attorney, southern district of Indiana, a Republican. The list goes on. Crime prevention is an issue that has been the subject of more misinformation and outright mischaracterization than perhaps any other in the crime debate-- Whether we should work to prevent crime before it happens, instead of waiting until after the shots are fired, until after our children become addicted to drugs, until after more Americans' lives are ruined. The anticrime law enacted last year answered that question unapologetically. In addition to fighting crime--the law made a commitment to preventing crime. A commitment supported by virtually every criminologist, every legal scholar, every sociologist, every psychologist, every medical authority, and nearly everyone's common sense. Those who study this issue agree that breaking the cycle of violence and crime requires an investment in the lives of our children-- With support and guidance to help them reject the violence and anarchy of the streets in favor of taking positive responsibility for their lives. In fact, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National District Attorneys Association, and the International Brotherhood of Police Officers cite prevention programs as critical to a long-term cure for crime. Prevention is what cops want--what virtually everyone in law enforcement wants. Every police officer I have talked to, every prosecutor, every prison warden, every probation officer says the same thing--we can't do it alone. And listen to local officials--the very people the Republicans say they want to give greater voice. Republican Mayors Giuliani of New York and Riordan of Los Angeles say this: By funding proven prevention programs for young people, the crime bill offers hope--hope that in the future we can reduce the need for so many police officers and jails. Listen to Paul Helmke, the Republican mayor of Fort Wayne, IN: It's a lot less expensive to do things on the prevention side than on the police side. And prevention of crime--particularly juvenile crime--is more important now than ever before. Last week the Department of Justice released its first national report on juvenile offenders and victims. The report found that between 1988 and 1992 the juvenile violent crime arrest rate has increased by more than 50 percent. It further estimated that even if the crime rate ceases to grow in future years, juvenile population growth alone would produce a 22 percent rise in violent crime arrests. Should the violent rate continue to grow as it has between 1988 and 1992, the number of juveniles arrested for violent crimes will double by the year 2010--to more than 260,000 arrests! Attorney General Janet Reno specifically cited prevention and intervention programs as one of the fundamental ways to combat this type of growth in juvenile crime. Prisons, though essential, are a testament to failure: They are the right place for people gone wrong. On the other hand, when a life about to go wrong is set back on the right track--that is a testament to hope. We build hope by showing children that they matter, by challenging disaffection with affection and respect, and by contrasting the dead- end of violence with the opportunity for a constructive life-- I would now like to briefly comment on the three programs in this amendment. local crime prevention block grants Local crime prevention block grants were created to allow cities and towns to develop their own prevention programs to combat child abuse, youth gangs, drug abuse by children, and crimes against the elderly-- including the D.A.R.E. Program and the boys and girls clubs. Local crime prevention grants enable communities to institute successful initiatives such as: Measures to prevent juvenile violence, juvenile gangs, and the use and sale of illegal drugs by juveniles, programs to prevent crimes against the elderly, midnight sports league programs to keep kids off the street and away from drugs, supervised sports and recreation programs after school and on holidays, the establishment of Boys and Girls Clubs of America in public housing facilities, and the creation of special crime units to deal with crimes in which a child is involved, to name a few. These prevention strategies and programs have proven effective in reducing the incidence of crime in both the short and long term. Here are some examples of programs that have proven track records: In hundreds of public housing projects across the country, boys and girls clubs give kids a safe place to hang out after school--a place with positive activities and positive role models. A recent, independent evaluation has reported that housing projects with clubs experience 13 percent fewer juvenile crimes, 22 percent less drug activity, and 25 percent less crack use, than do projects with clubs. In Honolulu, professionals identify families at risk for neglect or abuse when children are born and then visit their homes regularly over several years to help parents learn to care for their children. In Houston, Texas, a core of professionals provides one-on-one counseling, mentoring, tutoring, job training and crisis-intervention services to students at risk for dropping out. And in Delaware, ``Stormin' Normin'' Oliver runs an award-winning summer basketball league--in which team members must participate in supervised study sessions and perform community-service work in addition to their time on the courts. Although many communities are putting their best foot forward, the need and demand for prevention programs far outpace the supply. And yet the republicans have targeted prevention grants in the crime law for complete elimination--a move some charge is cold-hearted and mean. But I say it is just plain dumb. Local crime prevention block grants are one of the best means we have to ensure States and localities have the funding they need to reduce crime over the long haul. Weed and seed is a republican, Bush administration program, the brainchild of former Attorney General William Barr. The program funds prevention efforts and comprehensive law enforcement efforts. [[Page S 14647]] The weed and seed program has achieved notable success primarily because it requires the kind of community policing that works, and then requires that law enforcement, social service agencies, the private sector, and the community work together to prevent crime. So this is a program that works because it utilizes both law enforcement and community participation. In a number of cities--such as Madison, Houston, Trenton, and Camden--notable reductions in crime have been achieved in weed and seed areas. Many of weed and seed's biggest fans are former Republican U.S. attorneys. Let me tell you what a few of them have said: Joe Whitley, former U.S. attorney from the northern district of Georgia: I have said that this is the most important matter I have ever dealt with as U.S. attorney. It's a simple but fundamentally sound idea that people in communities really seemed to believe. * * * The program is responsive to the concerns of citizens. It's positive because residents thought it had real credibility--combining law enforcement and prevention. Michael Chertoff, former U.S. attorney for New Jersey: Trenton was a pilot city. It was a very successful project and I think very highly of it. * * * Community policing worked very well in closing the distance between the police and the community, and it deterred crime because it gave the police a better reputation within the community. Debra Daniels, former U.S. attorney from the southern district of Indiana: In a nutshell, it is the kind of program that you want. ``Program'' is the wrong word because it connotes money only--you want to emphasize the aspect of weed and seed that has to do with planning at the grassroots level. Weed and seed requires collaboration of all governmental agencies working closely at all levels with people in neighborhoods to create a complete package of crime fighting, policing, human services and economic development. * * * The community leadership development was miraculous and the crime rate decreased. The consensus of all the law enforcement experts around the country is that youth gangs are a serious problem and a growing problem. The most recent report on juvenile offenders from the office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention at the department of justice reports that the number of jurisdictions affected by youth gangs has increased substantially in the last 20 years and that gang- related crime has increased since the late 1980s. Yet very little is done to directly target youth gangs. This amendment would boost funds for the two Department of Justice programs that specifically target this problem. One of these is the gang free schools and communities program, which funds counseling, education, and crisis intervention through coordinated social service, substance abuse treatment and other means. The other is the community based gang intervention program, which: (1) develops regional task forces of state, local and community organizations to fight gangs; (2) encourages cooperation among local education, juvenile justice, employment, and social service agencies and community based organizations; and (3) funds programs offering effective punishment options, including restitution, community service, home detention, and boot camps. So this amendment provides an absolutely critical prevention element to our overall anti-crime efforts. The 1994 crime law provided over $300 million of authorized funding for prevention programs for the next year but the Republican appropriations bill eliminated virtually all of it. Offset: this amendment would restore $80 million--one quarter of the lost prevention funds--to fund these three programs. The money is taken from a portion of new FBI salaries and expenses that were increased above the president's request. I urge my colleagues to support this vital amendment. I will conclude by saying that I have great respect for the abilities of my friend from Texas. But this is about weed and seed and other good programs, not about midnight basketball. Whenever I debate him on issues relating to guns, he pulls out his mama's gun and says, ``You ain't going to take my mama's gun from her.'' I am not after his mama's gun or midnight basketball. This works. I challenge anybody in this Chamber to go home and ask 10 police chiefs in your State--10--and I am prepared to bet you that 9 of those 10 will tell you that they desperately need these local prevention programs. The reason they got put in the bill in the first place is because of the cops. Not a single social worker came to me and said: You have to put in prevention when this bill is written. Not one single bleeding heart liberal came to me and said: You have to put in prevention. The cops want the prevention money. Senators Cohen and Kohl are correct. I yield the floor.

The motion to lay that motion on the table. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am trying to work out an agreement here. I do not know that starting a debate on a new amendment moves us toward that objective. I would like to ask unanimous consent that debate on all amendments to this bill end, and that we proceed to third reading by 8:30. Mr. HOLLINGS. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Mr. HOLLINGS. I have to object to the request at this time. Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa. [[Page S 14648]] Amendment No. 2844 (Purpose: To restrict the location of judicial conferences and meetings, and for other purposes) Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and I ask for its consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the committee amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for himself, and Mr. Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 2844. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: On page 92, insert between lines 13 and 14 the following new sections: Sec. 305. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none of the funds made available under this title shall be used for any conference or meeting authorized under section 333 of title 28, United States Code, if such conference or meeting takes place at a location outside the geographic boundaries of the circuit court of appeals over which the chief judge presides, except in the case of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which shall be permitted to host conferences or meetings within a 50-mile radius of the District of Columbia without regard to the geographic boundaries of the circuit. (b) Of the funds appropriated under this title, no circuit shall receive more than $100,000 for conferences convened under section 333 of title 28, United States Code, during any year. Sec. 306. (a) Section 333 of title 28, United States Code, is amended-- (1) in the first paragraph, by striking ``shall'' the first, second, and fourth place it appears and inserting ``may''; and (2) in the second paragraph-- (A) by striking ``shall'' the first place it appears and inserting ``may''; and (B) by striking ``, and unless excused by the chief judge, shall remain throughout the conference''. (b) In the interest of saving taxpayer dollars and reducing the cost of Government, it is the sense of the Senate that the chief judges of the various United States circuit courts should use new communications technologies to conduct judicial conferences. (c) This section shall apply only to contracts entered into after the date of enactment of this Act. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment, on behalf of myself and Senator Kyl, that would stop a wasteful Government practice that has received a lot of press attention lately and has drawn sharp criticism from watchdog groups like the National Taxpayers Union. Mr. President, the practice I am talking about is taxpayer-funded travel by Federal judges to so-called judicial conferences. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, I am concerned about the budgetary propriety of continuing current practice with regard to judicial conferences in this new era of balanced budgets and streamlined Government. Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that two newspaper articles be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. The first article is entitled ``Taxpayers Foot the Bill for Judges to Meet at Resort'' and the second is entitled ``Times Are Tight, But Circuit Isn't.'' The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See exhibits 1 and 2.) Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I commend these revealing articles to my colleagues. In the first article, U.S. District Court judge, William Nickerson, is quoted as saying, ``As a taxpayer, I would probably complain,'' when asked about a judicial conference hosted at the five-star Greenbrier resort in West Virginia. The second article recounts that a Federal judge and former Congressman introduced a resolution to reduce the cost of judicial conferences in the ninth circuit by having them less frequently. Sadly, this responsible and wise proposal was defeated by a vote of 5 to 3. This amendment removes the requirement that conferences be held, giving Federal courts the flexibility to schedule conferences or, if they decide not to schedule them, just to not have a conference. In brief, Mr. President, the amendment will limit the location of judicial conferences to the geographic boundaries of the circuit to minimize travel costs which obviously come when there is travel outside of the circuit. It would also amend Federal law so that judicial conferences are no longer mandatory, and express the sense of the Senate that the Federal Judiciary should explore the idea of using new communications technology--teleconferencing, et cetera--to conduct conferences without travel. I believe the amendment will save money and give new and needed flexibility to the Federal courts. As I said, Federal judges from around the country are currently compelled by law to attend a conference with other judges at least once every 2 years. So, I cannot fault anyone with scheduling these conferences or attending them since the law requires it. But I can--and do--find fault with those who choose only the most luxurious hotels and resorts. I can--and do--find fault with some of the activities at these publicly funded conferences. According to some press reports, less than a third of the time judges spend at these conferences relates to judicial work. In one case, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper, during one 3-day conference at Hilton Head, SC, only 10 hours were set aside for work. The rest of the time was left open so that the attendees could socialize, visit with each other, or do whatever. Importantly, Federal courts are continuing these expensive conferences at the same time judicial resources are scarce and funds for representing poorer Americans are drying up. I respectfully submit that these are not sound priorities. The amendment that I and Senator Kyl offer today does what even some judges want to do. It would limit the location of judicial conferences to major urban areas--I want to emphasize this--within the circuit court of appeals, not outside. A few circuits, where judges are dissatisfied with the resorts within their circuit boundaries, have been going halfway across the country to attend a judicial conference-- at taxpayer expense. I am not the first to note the extravagance and unnecessary expense associated with these conferences. Fair-minded judges have been complaining about these conferences themselves for years. To name just a few, Circuit Judge Charles Wiggins, of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and U.S. District Court Judge Frederic Smalkin have both complained that these conferences are unjustifiably expensive. A few years ago, a district court judge in Kansas City, like Judge Wiggins in the ninth circuit, was so outraged by the posh, remote resorts where these conferences are hosted that he introduced a resolution to limit the location of conferences. Yet another judge has referred to judicial conferences as a sort of ``camp.'' And U.S. District Court Judge Carl Rubin was quoted by the Cleveland Plain Dealer as saying ``there are a lot of things I'd rather see the taxpayers' money spent on than sending me to Hilton Head for 3 days.'' According to that same article, Pete Seep of the National Taxpayers' Union states his opinion that ``Federal taxpayers are paying judges to party.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters written to me by Federal judges--one from Michigan and one from Texas--urging me to trim the excesses associated with judicial conferences be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. Bankruptcy court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Flint, MI, July 6, 1995. Re Travel/Chambers savings. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Chairman, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, Washington, DC. Dear Senator Grassley: I read in a recent article in the Wall Street Journal how you were trying to effectuate needed savings in the budget for the federal judiciary. As a member of the lowest rung on the ladder of the federal judiciary, I offer two suggestions for savings within the judicial branch. I have been a bankruptcy judge for 11 years. As you know, federal judges are required by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 333 to attend a judicial conference each year. The first year I attended such a conference, it occurred to me that there was a place where some savings could be effected. In my experience, the judicial conferences are arranged so that the judges travel usually on a Tuesday and return home on a Friday or Saturday. As you are well aware, commercial airlines give tremendous discounts for early booking with a Saturday night stayover. The thought came [[Page S 14649]] to mind long ago that if judges were required to attend the conference over a Saturday night, it could save a lot of money. This concept holds true for Federal Judicial Center functions as well. My suggestion was met with the response that judges prefer to be home with their families on the weekends. While that is obviously true (when I suggested this, I had two small children at home, ages eight and five), I did not think it was too much to ask high government officials to give up a weekend once in a while, especially since such a large savings would be created. Now that funding is much tighter, I repeat this suggestion. Another suggestion deals with the cost of furnishing chambers. Due to expansion in the district court, I was asked to move my courtrooms and chambers out of the federal buildings in Flint and Bay City. In the process, I was given a budget for furnishing chambers (which included my personal office, my secretary's office and reception area, my law clerk's office, the library, the media room, two attorney conference rooms, and the courtroom waiting area) for $25,000 total. We just about made it for that amount. I do not know for sure, but I have been told that other judges are allowed roughly $50,000 for furnishing a much smaller chambers' unit. Perhaps some uniformity would save some money. While I am in accord with the statements of the federal judge quoted in the Journal article with respect to there being a need for decorum and dignity in a federal courthouse, I also concur in your efforts and those of Senator Baucus to provide that at a lower cost. By effectuating some reasonable savings in non-essential areas, Congress ought to be able to reinstitute cost of living increases for the judiciary. Without such regular adjustments, of course, Congress is condemning the judiciary to consistent decreases in take-home pay. Sincerely, Arthur J. Spector, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge. ____ U.S. District Court, Western District of Texas, San Antonio, TX, June 6, 1995. Hon. Charles E. Grassley, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC Dear Senator Grassley: At a recent conference of the Fifth Judicial Circuit, we were advised of your efforts to address government expenditures for judicial meetings and conferences. I applaud and encourage such efforts. All branches of government must search for and find ways of reducing government expense. This area can be modified, relatively painlessly, with no loss in the quality of judicial services provided. Title 28 U.S.C. Section 333 allows an annual circuit conferences and requires that one be held in each circuit no more than every two years. Attendances for judges summoned is mandatory. Perhaps Section 333 could be amended to reduce the number of circuit conferences and/or permit participation to be optional. Once per year, we also hold separate workshops for circuit judges, district judges, magistrate judges, and bankruptcy judges. These instructional meetings address various substantive topics and can be beneficial. However, the information can be provided to us in written form at our offices to avoid the cost of travel, housing, meals, and lectures. I am sure many more ways of reducing expenses for judicial meetings exist. These meetings can be valuable but are not absolutely necessary to the administration of justice. Particularly in these economic times, their cost is difficult to justify. I wanted you to know that judges will support, and even participate in, efforts to reduce the amount of money allocated to the judiciary's budget. Sincerly, John W. Primomo, U.S. Magistrate Judge. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I believe that the costs of conferences are underestimated. These estimates--which range as high as one-half million dollars per conference--do not take into account lost time on the bench for judges and their support staff, who also attend the conferences at taxpayer expense. And the taxpayers foot these expenses year after year. The party's over, Mr. President. There is a word for this sort of thing: Boondoggle. I have fought against wasting taxpayer money my whole career in the Senate, and I am committed to fighting unnecessary spending in the judiciary. Mr. President, under current law, Federal judges are required to host and attend these conferences. This amendment will change that so that judges have the flexibility not to call a judicial conference. This amendment would also give individual Federal judges the option of not attending a conference. This is fair, and permits Federal courts--which I believe will act responsibly in light of the Federal Government's budgetary constraints--to pitch in and tighten belts along with us in Congress and the executive branch. As I have said, Mr. President, this amendment is about saving taxpayer dollars and priorities. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Finally, I just want to say that this amendment should not be viewed as a general indictment of the Federal judiciary. For the most part, I think that the judiciary has taken responsible and important steps to reduce unnecessary spending. This amendment is simply targeted to a use of Federal funds that, in the opinion of this Senator, should be pruned. Thank you, Mr. President. Exhibit 1 [From the Baltimore Sun, June 30, 1994] Taxpayers Foot the Bill for Judges to Meet at Resort (by Marcia Myers) As the federal judiciary struggles amid hiring freezes and funding shortages for basic services, 150 judges from Maryland and other parts of the Fourth Circuit converged yesterday on the broad verandas, lush fairways and tennis courts of the five-star Greebrier resort. Their taxpayer-financed gathering will demand little work in the afternoons and barely any at night--unless you count one banquet and a sing-along led by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. Of course, several hundred lawyers pay their own way, and those who consider schmoozing part of the job might argue that they're working tirelessly. The cost to taxpayers for the four-day conference: about $200,000. Even some who appreciate the Greenbrier's pampering question the propriety of the trip to the mountains of White Sulphur Springs, W.Va. ``As a taxpayer, I would probably complain,'' U.S. District Judge William M. Nickerson said, while adding that the meeting offers a good opportunity to talk informally with other judges. ``I think a lot of the judges have some concerns as taxpayers. Some feel it's more of a luxury than it needs to be.'' Others are more direct in criticizing the annual conference, for which taxpayers will pay up to $1,000 per judge plus travel expenses. ``I don't think the expense is justified on an annual basis,'' said U.S. District Judge Frederic N. Smalkin. Consider the schedule for the conference, which includes district, magistrate and bankruptcy judges from Maryland, North and South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia: Day 1: Judges arrive--no activities are planned. Day 2: Judges attend a morning session for about 3 hours to discuss court business. No other activities are planned until the Rehnquist sing-along that evening. Day 3: A trio of one-hour lectures on ethics is scheduled. At noon, the six new judges in the circuit offer brief remarks. Nothing else is planned until an evening reception and banquet. Day 4: The morning features a panel discussion reviewing major Supreme Court decisions of the 1993 term. That ends the conference, although judges on committees may attend additional meetings. Meanwhile, conferees are encouraged to sign up for group activities that include tennis, golf, bridge and hiking. Among the resort's other amenities: three 18-hole championship golf courses, fly fishing, skeet shooting, horseback riding, swimming, and the Greenbrier Spa, Mineral Baths & Salon. ``Personally, I think it's of real value,'' Senior U.S. District Judge John R. Hargrove said of the conference. ``Do we have to cut our own throats just because Congress won't give us more money? We still have to have training. We don't go down there and sit around.'' Why not have a shorter meeting, strictly business, at a less luxurious spot? ``We tried that at least once in the 20 years since I came here,'' said the circuit's Chief Judge, Sam J. Ervin III of North Carolina. ``The afternoon sessions were not very productive--nobody much came. ``I think the most important thing about this conference is that lawyers have an opportunity to mingle with the judges and share their problems and difficulties.'' That talk could include concerns over the shrinking resources of the federal courts. Amid a hiring freeze in Maryland and across the nation, the courts are at 84 percent of adequate staffing levels--the lowest ever, according to a court official. And the situation could get worse. Court officials worry about funds for court security, courtroom deputies and computers. Business that used to be done in a day in Baltimore, for example, now can take several days because of staffing shortages. When asked how much the conference would cost taxpayers, Circuit Executive Samuel W. Phillips said about $55,000. But after acknowledging the $1,000 allowance for each judge, plus travel and administrative expenses, he estimated the cost at $175,000 to $200,000. Mr. Phillips said he had checked many other hotels for a better rate. But the Greenbrier includes two meals in its room rate, which makes it cheaper, he said. A typical room for two costs $434 a night, although the judges receive a discount that he wouldn't disclose. It's also one of the few hotels capable of accommodating everybody--judges, spouses and lawyers--under one roof, he said. The government pays for judges' hotel rooms and meals. The cost of recreation--at [[Page S 14650]] the Greenbrier, golf fees are $80 and tennis courts are $23 an hour-- comes from each judge's own pocket. The conference alternates every other year between the Greenbrier and the Homestead, a similar resort in Hot Springs, Va. The judges are quick to note that attendance is required-- by law. Congress passed a bill in the 1930s requiring judges in each circuit to gather annually to consider court business. As budget concerns have mounted in recent years, the law was amended to require a meeting only once every two years. Several circuits have cut back to biennial meetings, but Judge Ervin said the Fourth Circuit had rejected that idea. [From the Recorder, September 29, 1993] Times Are Tights, But Circuit Isn't (By Steve Albert) Soon after money problems forced postponement of pay raises for judicial employees and led federal judges to suspend civil jury trials, the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals spent about $600,000 to send 350 judges and lawyers to a four-day conference at a luxury Santa Barbara beach resort. While other circuits reacted to tight budgets this year by canceling their retreats or deciding to hold them every other year, the Ninth Circuit opted to go forward with its August 1993 conference and continue holding its retreat annually. Circuit chief Judge J. Clifford Wallace called the conference expenditures ``money well spent.'' Congress mandates that circuits hold conferences, Wallace said, and the retreats provide the only opportunity ``to bring together people who have responsibility to improve the administration of justice.'' Circuit and district judges, magistrates, bankruptcy judges, U.S. attorneys, federal public defenders and court clerks from nine Western states attend the conference. In addition, the circuit's 27 active judges get together six times a year, hold an annual winter symposium, and meet with different judges once every year or two for continuing education. Estimates of government expenses for the Santa Barbara conference were released last week shortly before the U.S. House of Representatives appropriated $2.8 billion for the judiciary for fiscal 1994, a 10 percent increase over this year. A House/Senate conference committee is expected to settle on the final number this week or next. The Senate wants to give this judiciary just a 5 percent increase for the new fiscal year, which begins Friday. The cost estimate of the Ninth Circuit conference, prepared by circuit executives at The Recorder's request, shows that 300 judges, prosecutors, public defenders and clerks traveled to Santa Barbara by air at an average cost of $550 each. Another 50 traveled by car from Los Angeles at an average cost of $50. The attendees spent an average of $250 for room and food each day of the four-day conference and an average of $34 on check-out day. Add in about $27,000 for such items as speakers' travel, printing and audiovisual material, and the total bill for taxpayers was about $556,000. Because judges submit individual expense vouchers, that figure is an estimate only. The figure does not include the cost of travel during the rest of the year for the 12 judges who meet four times annually to help plan the conference. About 100 other attendees, mostly lawyers in private practice, paid their own way. $100 million bailout The conference came just eight months after the U.S. Judicial Conference--the governing body of the federal courts--imposed a hiring freeze and postponed some pay increases for federal court employees in the Ninth Circuit and around the country. At the same time, the Judicial Conference's executive committee trimmed court operating expenses as well as probation and pretrial services funding, citing a $100 million operating shortfall. In June, citing a lack of funds to pay jurors, federal trial courts around the country briefly suspended some civil jury trials, Congress passed a $100 million bailout for the courts in early July. The budget shortfall prompted Wallace in May to propose that many indigents who need court-appointed lawyers be asked to repay the government for the cost of their defense, much as students are required to pay off student loans for college tuition. The savings, he theorized, could be used to avoid funding shortfalls. But Wallace said Monday that despite budgetary problems, the conference remained an essential expense. He cited the circuit's recently released study of gender bias in the courts and its decision to study bias based on race, religion and ethnicity as examples of the work the conference takes on. ``No one can doubt the importance of those issues,'' Wallace said. ``It would be difficult to cut the conference because of budget difficulty.'' Other circuits around the country have cancelled their annual conferences, however. The New York-based Second Circuit and Denver-based Tenth Circuit cancelled their 1993 meetings, and the St. Louis-based Eighth Circuit has cancelled its 1994 conference. Four other circuits have gone to biennial conferences. A call to cancel future Ninth Circuit conferences was defeated by a 5-3 vote of the circuit's executive committee at its August meeting in Santa Barbara. Circuit Judge Charles Wiggins, a former Republican congressman, warned colleagues then that the cost could engender the wrong ``public perception,'' especially in tight budget times. Executive committee members voted to go ahead with the circuit's 1994 conference in San Diego and its 1995 conference in Hawaii. Exactly how much the Ninth Circuit or other circuits spend on annual conferences is difficult to pinpoint, according to circuit executives and a spokesman for the U.S. Administrative Office of the Courts, which disburses money to the federal bench. Judges submit conference expense vouchers and reimbursement checks are issued in Washington. The Ninth Circuit cost estimates were based on average airfare costs calculated by circuit executives and the $250 maximum per day charge judges and other government employees are allowed for lodging and food. Circuit conference expenses are subtracted from the ``Salaries and Expenses'' line of the courts' budget. Individual circuit expenses are never set forth in judicial budget requests, said David Sellers, a spokesman for the administrative office of the courts. ``It doesn't get much more specific than that,'' Sellers said. New Jersey District Chief Judge John Gerry, who chairs the Judicial Conference's executive committee, said the Ninth Circuit's conference cost estimate was the first such estimate he had ever heard. The executive committee, which holds the Judicial Conference's purse strings, does not take up or examine individual circuit expenditures, he said. But the conference a year ago asked circuits to evaluate the necessity of retreats and their costs. ``There hasn't been any area of court operations we have not looked at to save a buck here and there,'' Gerry said. His own circuit, the Third, has gone to biennial conferences. a model circuit Wallace said the work of the Ninth Circuit conference has been recognized by other circuits. ``Some of us do a better job than others in our efforts to improve the system,'' Wallace said. If efforts were not made to improve the administration of justice, he added, costs of administering the courts could be higher than they already are. ``The budgeting problem is very complicated,'' Wallace said. ``By singling out one aspect, the overall picture can be blurred. We have thrashed this out. We have been responsible.'' But some circuit judges like Wiggins have complained that the conference is not as productive as Wallace or others may think. ``We don't talk about much of interest to any of us; our discussions are so broad,'' Wiggins told his colleagues in Santa Barbara. At the Santa Barbara meeting, conferees discussed cooperation with the executive and legislative branches and, in addition to passing a resolution calling for a task force to study bias, passed one supporting adequate funding for the courts. Savings in conference costs would not have offset lack of funds for jury trials or public defender programs because those costs come out of different budget lines than the line used to pay for conferences, said Wallace and court spokesman Sellers. This year's conference schedule, like those in the past, included such diversions as tennis and golf tournaments, a spouse sightseeing and winery tour and cooking and flower arranging classes. Wallace confirmed that the Ninth Circuit conference next August will be held at the Loews Coronado Bay Resort on the beach south of San Diego. The resorts offers bayside suites and has three heated pools and a marina.
