0,"SENDING UNITED STATES TROOPS TO BOSNIA Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I, like many people, have been distressed over the weekend listening to a lot of the comments as to what is going on in Bosnia, and this seems to be--and it is portrayed by this administration that it is--a done deal. Many Republicans and many Democrats are also saying that it is a done deal; that the troops are going to go; the President has made up his mind. The President, back in February 1993, made a commitment of 25,000 American troops on the ground in Bosnia, and he has decided they are going to go. So I guess the easy thing is to say, well, the President made the decision; I may not agree with it or I may agree with it but nonetheless the decision is made, and we want to support our troops that are over there. I am really getting tired of the demagoging that is going on about supporting the troops that are over there, as if this thing is a done deal. I grant you, Mr. President, I agree that the President of the United States does have the constitutional right to deploy troops. I think it is wrong, and historically it has not been done. The Presidents have come to the American people and have come through Congress for resolutions of approval, and this President has chosen not to do this. Of course, I will remind all America that the House of Representatives, the other body, has already on two occasions expressed itself in a very, very strong vote in opposition to the deployment of ground troops to Bosnia. So we turn on the talk radio shows and we look at the news accounts, and they say, well, it is already a done deal and Congress has no role; Congress is not relevant in this debate. I just do not buy that. I think this is still America, and the American people can be heard, and the best way for the American people to be heard is through their elected representatives. I think we have just a few hours to stop this thing. I am talking now about the mass deployment. Yes, the President has already sent several hundred troops into the area of Tuzla, which is the northeastern sector, in which I had occasion to spend quite a bit of time, and I see an environment which is the most hostile environment that perhaps we have ever had the occasion to deploy any American troop into in the history of this country. We talk about and can identify that there are more than 6 million mines of all shapes and sizes that are out there, and you cannot do anything about rendering those mines harmless because the ground is now frozen and they will not appear really until a heavy vehicle gets on top of them. Of course, we are talking about the deployment of 130 M1 tanks and several other armored vehicles, so it is a very frightening thing. It is a frightening thing to think it is not just a matter of three factions that do not like each other in the former Yugoslavia. It is not just the Serbs and the Croats and the Moslems, because in addition to that you have the Bosnian Serbs, you have the Bosnian Moslems, you have the Arkan Tigers, you have the Black Swans, you have the Afghanistans, you have the Iranians. You have all of these, what we call rogue factions over there. And yet they say it is a done deal. I think it is too easy to say that. I hope that everyone in America will demand that their Senator get on record on this issue. Mr. President, we are going to give them the opportunity to get on record on this issue. Last week, I served notice that there is going to be an up-or-down vote on the sending of troops into Bosnia. It is not a matter of supporting our troops that are there. You bet we support them. I know something about being a troop. I used to be in a troop, and I wanted the support of the American people and got it. I think every Member of this Senate, every Member of the other body, is going to support our troops wherever they are. That is not the issue. That is a copout. The issue is, should they be over there to begin with? I can remember so well when Michael Rose, who was the commanding general of the troops, the U.N. troops, in Bosnia said, if America sends troops over there, they will have more casualties than they had in the Persian Gulf. That was 390. In the Senate Armed Services Committee, when I asked Secretary Perry and Secretary Christopher and General Shalikashvili--I said, ``Is that mission to contain a civil war and to protect the integrity of NATO worth more than 400 American lives?'' And Secretary Perry said yes; Secretary Christopher said yes; General Shalikashvili said yes. But I say no, because, you see, Mr. President, they were speaking on behalf of the President of the United States, the top people, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and, of course, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. So now we say it is a done deal and that Congress is not relevant. But I say we are going to have a vote on this, and people are going to have to be responsible for it. I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that at this point an editorial be printed in the Record, a December 1 editorial by Abraham Sofaer. There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Clinton Needs Congress on Bosnia (By Abraham D. Sofaer) President Clinton has appealed to Congress and the American people to support his policy committing 20,000 ground troops to implement the peace agreement reached between Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia. It is a tribute to the American people that the president is accorded the greatest deference when he calls for the greatest sacrifice. Americans respond, at least initially, to such appeals from their President. But Mr. Clinton is exploiting this quality. He has presented the agreement and the American role in its enforcement as an accomplished fact, though the documents have yet to be signed by the parties, and numerous preconditions to U.S. involvement have yet to be fulfilled. He is consulting with Congress, but he is already sending troops to the area without any form of legislative approval. Indeed, he claims that, while he would welcome Congress's approval, he plans to go ahead regardless. Presidents often try to get what they want by leading aggressively. Congress nevertheless has a duty to study carefully the proposed operation and then express its view. The essential first step in that debate is to read the documents signed recently in Dayton. The complex agreement, with 12 annexes, calls for Bosnia to remain a single but divided nation, and all the warring factions [[Page S 17879]] to withdraw to specific lines. The agreement covers virtually all aspects of future life in Bosnia, including the division of its governments, the contents of its constitution, the selection of its judges, and the manner in which its police force is to be chosen and trained. Of principal interest to Congress, though, are those aspects of the agreement that create obligations and expectations for the U.S. to fulfill. our obligations These obligations, when carefully examined in context, carry to the ultimate extreme the policy of forcing a settlement on the Bosnians, rather than attempting to create an internal situation that is militarily balanced. Most significantly, the agreement makes the U.S., through the ``implementation force'' (IFOR), the military guarantor of the overall arrangement. The role of U.S. troops cannot be characterized as ``peacekeeping.'' Even ``implementation'' understates our obligation, IFOR will be close to an occupying army, in a conflict that has merely been suspended. We are likely to have as many difficulties acting as occupiers without having won a victory as the U.N.'s war crimes tribunal is having in attempting to apply its decisions in Bosnia without the power to enforce them. IFOR's principal responsibilities are set out in Annex 1(a) of the agreement: The parties agree to cease hostilities and to withdraw all forces to agreed lines in three phases. Detailed rules have been agreed upon, including special provisions regarding Sarajevo and Gorazde. But IFOR is responsible for marking the cease-fire lines and the ``inter-entity boundary line and its zone of separation,'' which in effect will divide the Bosnian Muslims and Croats from the Bosnian Serbs. The parties agree that IFOR may use all necessary force to ensure their compliance with these disengagement rules. The parties agree to ``strictly avoid committing any reprisals, counterattacks, or any unilateral actions in response to violations of this annex by another party.'' The only response allowed to alleged violations is through the procedures provided in Article VIII of the Annex, which establishes a ``joint military commission''--made up of all the parties--to consider military complaints, questions and problems. But the commission is only ``a consultative body for the IFOR commander,'' an American general who is explicitly deemed ``the final authority in theater regarding interpretation of this agreement. . . .'' This enormous power--to prevent even acts of self defense--will carry proportionate responsibility for harm that any party may attribute to IFOR's lack of responsiveness or fairness. IFOR is also given the responsibility to support various nonmilitary tasks, including creating conditions for free and fair elections; assisting humanitarian organizations; observing and preventing ``interference with the movement of civilian populations, refugees, and displaced persons''; clearing the roads of mines; controlling all airspace (even for civilian air travel); and ensuring access to all areas unimpeded by checkpoints, roadblocks or other obstacles. Taken together, these duties essentially give IFOR control of the physical infrastructure of both parts of the Bosnian state. It seems doubtful that the 60,000-man force could meet these expectations. Article IX of the agreement recognizes the ``obligation of all parties to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law.'' This is an especially sensitive matter. Yet there is no mechanism in the accord for bringing to justice men who haven't been defeated in battle and who aren't in custody. This means that IFOR is almost certain to come under pressure by victims and human rights advocates to capture and deliver up the principal villains. Will it do better than we did in fulfilling our promise to capture Mohammed Farah Aidid in Somalia? The agreement makes vague promises about reversing ``ethnic cleansing'' by guaranteeing refugees the right to return to their homes. Since this is in practice impossible, the West will end up paying billions in compensation awards promised in the agreement. The agreement contains numerous provisions regarding the manner in which Bosnia is to be governed, with checks and balances built in that are based on ethnic or geographic terms. But Americans traditionally have not believed in such divisions of political authority. We fought the Civil War to put into place an undivided nation based on the principle that all people are of equal worth, and all must live in accordance with the law. It took a Tito to keep the ethnically divided Yugoslavia together. Will IFOR now assume his role of enforcing a constitution based on principles abhorrent to Western values? Even if the basic structure of the government works, what role will IFOR have to play in resolving disputes over the numerous sensitive areas that the parties have seen fit to write into the accords? If the parties don't resolve some matters successfully, they are likely to blame IFOR for these failures. Finally, the agreement draws a vague distinction between ``military'' and ``civilian'' matters. Ultimate authority over the latter is allocated to a U.N. high representative, who is to act through a ``joint civilian commission'' consisting of senior political representatives of the parties and the IFOR commander or his representative. The high representative is to exchange information and maintain liaison on a regular basis with IFOR, and shall attend or be represented at meetings of the joint military commission and offer advice ``particularly on matters of a political- military nature.'' But it is also made clear that the high representative ``shall have no authority over the IFOR and shall not in any way interfere in the conduct of military operations or the IFOR chain of command.'' This may seem a reassuring confirmation of IFOR's power to avoid U.N. restrictions on the use of force. Ultimately, however, IFOR's role could be made untenable if it finds itself in a confrontation with the U.N.'s designated representative about the proper handling of a ``political'' matter. What would happen, for example, if the U.N. high representative determined that U.S. forces had gone too far in defending themselves under President Clinton's policy of effectively responding to attacks ``and then some''? either/or Congress cannot redo the agreement reached by the parties. But there is no need for lawmakers to accept President Clinton's either/or approach--either support his plan to implement the agreement, or pull out entirely. If the agreement represents a genuine desire for peace among the warring parties, then presumably the accord is not so fragile as to depend on the oral commitment of U.S. troops made by the administration (and which isn't even part of the agreement). Congress can and should consider other options. The U.S., for example, could assist European forces in demarcating the boundary lines, and could enforce peace in the area through the threat of air strikes on important targets. Or the U.S. could offer greater monetary and diplomatic support for the agreement but not any ground troops. Whatever happens with the troop commitment, Congress should insist that the agreement's provisions allowing the training and arming of the Bosnian Muslims be rigorously adhered to. A balance of power among the hostile parties is ultimately the only basis for long-term stability in the region. And if American troops are sent to Bosnia, they will be unable to leave responsibly until such a balance has been developed. That would certainly take longer than the yearlong limit imposed by the administration. Mr. INHOFE. This is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution who took the time to read the some 12 annexes that we have to this agreement that has been initialed and all that was said. We realize the responsibility that we have in the United States for this so-called peacekeeping effort. But stop and think. This is not peacekeeping; this is peace implementation. There is a little thing called mission creep. We saw it in Vietnam. We saw it in Somalia. It is a thing where you go in and tell the American people, ``We are just keeping peace. There is no war on over there.'' Mr. President, I was in the northeast sector of Bosnia. There is a war going on over there. The firing did not stop. The firepower is going on right now. You can hear it. You are walking around with a shrapnel jacket and helmet. You are not doing that to keep warm even though you are doing anything you can to keep warm in that area. There was a blizzard 3 weeks ago when I was there. Nonetheless, when this scholar read the accords, not only are we responsible for implementing, that is, making peace; but we also are responsible for rebuilding the infrastructure. This $2 billion they bandy around is not even a drop in the bucket of what we are going to have to spend if the President has his way and has a mass deployment into Bosnia. I had a telephone conversation not more than just 10 minutes ago with a retired captain, Jim Smith, who lost his leg in Vietnam and lost his son in Somalia. His son was one of those soldiers, one of those 18 Rangers that were sent over there originally for some type of a humanitarian mission that was supposed to open up the roads so we could send humanitarian goods in to some of the Somalian people. Yes, that seemed to be a good idea. It was a 45-day mission to start with. Then President Clinton was elected. I was serving in the other body at the time, and every month we sent a resolution that said, ``Mr. President, bring our troops home from Somalia. We do not have anything at stake there in terms of our Nation's security.'' He did not do it and did not do it and did not do it until finally 18 of our Rangers were murdered in cold blood, their corpses were mutilated and dragged through the streets of Mogadishu. And one of those corpses was Cpl. Jim Smith, the son of Capt. Jim Smith. I talked to Capt. Jim Smith, who spent a career in the military and knows a lot more about it than I do. Captain Smith said there are so many parallels between what happened to his [[Page S 17880]] son and what is going to happen to many other sons and daughters if we allow the mass deployment of troops into Bosnia. He said one of the things that stuck in his mind was the last letter that he got from his son, Cpl. Jim Smith, who said, ``Dad, the biggest problem we have is we don't know who the good guys and the bad guys are.'' This was in Somalia. This was one of the last letters, maybe the last letter, written by Cpl. Jim Smith before his body was dragged through the streets of Mogadishu. He said, ``We don't know who the good guys and the bad guys are.'' That is exactly what happened 2\1/2\ years ago when President Clinton made the first decision for airdrops. I asked the person--and I cannot use his name in this public forum because it was a restricted meeting-- I said, ``How do you know when we drop the stuff whether it's going to get to the good guys or the bad guys?'' He scratched his head and said, ``You know, I don't think we know that. Come to think of it, I'm not sure we know who the good guys and the bad guys are.'' That is because if you take a snapshot of any time in the history of Bosnia or the former Yugoslavia, you will find that at one time the Croats are the bad guys and the Serbs are the good guys; another time the Moslems have just finished butchering several thousand people, they are the bad guys, the Croats are the good guys. Most recently we assume the Serbs are the bad guys, so we, under the direction of President Clinton, chose sides in that civil war. At that time, many of us said, as soon as they do airdrops, then there will be airstrikes, and then they will want to send troops in. And that is exactly what has happened. So this not over. It is not a done deal. I know the President right now is on a wave. His numbers look good. Mr. President, I can understand that, because you are an excellent politician. You just came back from Europe. You were talking about how everyone was cheering you over there. No wonder they are cheering over in Europe. You are saying we are committing 70 percent of the cost for this, and we are committing 30 percent of our troops to fight with your other troops, to fight your battles for you. That is not our battle over there. That is relative to the security interests of Western Europe and Eastern Europe, not the United States. I saw the accounts on television when President Clinton was talking to the troops over there. I can remember when I was a troop, so I know how a troop thinks. When I was over there talking to those same troops just a few days before the President was there, they had one question. They said, ``What is our mission? Why are we going to this hostile area? Why is the President obsessed in sending us into Bosnia?'' I only say this today. I know we are out of time, Mr. President. I just want to say that it is not over yet. I reemphasize there will be no free rides. There is going to be a vote. Most likely it will be Wednesday, not the vote that the leader has that is going to be a watered-down version of conciliatory remarks about what has gone on over there and about protecting our troops. We all know we are going to support our troops. But this is going to be a vote on, Are we going to have a mass deployment of troops into Bosnia? Yes or no. And every Senator on this floor is going to have to make a record and stand up and say how he feels so that the people at home will know. I do not know, Mr. President, how your calls are coming in in your office back in Tennessee. But I can tell you what mine are in Oklahoma. They are about 100 to 1 against it. That is because there is an infinite wisdom of the people of this country once left alone to make up their mind and make that judgment. It is not a beltway decision. It is not a Washington, DC, decision. It is not the kind of wisdom you get in the White House or within the beltway. It is back in real America where real people, real fathers and mothers are, sons and daughters who are going to be over there, shipped over to this endless war in Bosnia. It is not going to be 12 months, Mr. President. When we were up in the area of Tuzla where our troops are going to be deployed, I said something about 12 months, and they all laughed. They said, ``You mean 12 years.'' This is the time for it to be stopped. If Somalia had been stopped before the murder of the 18 Rangers over there and their mutilated bodies were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu, that would not have happened. This is the time to stop this before the mutilated bodies of Americans are dragged through the streets of Tuzla. I yield the floor. Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.

There was a blizzard 3 weeks ago when I was there. Nonetheless, when this scholar read the accords, not only are we responsible for implementing, that is, making peace; but we also are responsible for rebuilding the infrastructure. This $2 billion they bandy around is not even a drop in the bucket of what we are going to have to spend if the President has his way and has a mass deployment into Bosnia. I had a telephone conversation not more than just 10 minutes ago with a retired captain, Jim Smith, who lost his leg in Vietnam and lost his son in Somalia. His son was one of those soldiers, one of those 18 Rangers that were sent over there originally for some type of a humanitarian mission that was supposed to open up the roads so we could send humanitarian goods in to some of the Somalian people. Yes, that seemed to be a good idea. It was a 45-day mission to start with. Then President Clinton was elected. I was serving in the other body at the time, and every month we sent a resolution that said, ``Mr. President, bring our troops home from Somalia. We do not have anything at stake there in terms of our Nation's security.'' He did not do it and did not do it and did not do it until finally 18 of our Rangers were murdered in cold blood, their corpses were mutilated and dragged through the streets of Mogadishu. And one of those corpses was Cpl. Jim Smith, the son of Capt. Jim Smith. I talked to Capt. Jim Smith, who spent a career in the military and knows a lot more about it than I do. Captain Smith said there are so many parallels between what happened to his [[Page S 17880]] son and what is going to happen to many other sons and daughters if we allow the mass deployment of troops into Bosnia. He said one of the things that stuck in his mind was the last letter that he got from his son, Cpl. Jim Smith, who said, ``Dad, the biggest problem we have is we don't know who the good guys and the bad guys are.'' This was in Somalia. This was one of the last letters, maybe the last letter, written by Cpl. Jim Smith before his body was dragged through the streets of Mogadishu. He said, ``We don't know who the good guys and the bad guys are.'' That is exactly what happened 2\1/2\ years ago when President Clinton made the first decision for airdrops. I asked the person--and I cannot use his name in this public forum because it was a restricted meeting-- I said, ``How do you know when we drop the stuff whether it's going to get to the good guys or the bad guys?'' He scratched his head and said, ``You know, I don't think we know that. Come to think of it, I'm not sure we know who the good guys and the bad guys are.'' That is because if you take a snapshot of any time in the history of Bosnia or the former Yugoslavia, you will find that at one time the Croats are the bad guys and the Serbs are the good guys; another time the Moslems have just finished butchering several thousand people, they are the bad guys, the Croats are the good guys. Most recently we assume the Serbs are the bad guys, so we, under the direction of President Clinton, chose sides in that civil war. At that time, many of us said, as soon as they do airdrops, then there will be airstrikes, and then they will want to send troops in. And that is exactly what has happened. So this not over. It is not a done deal. I know the President right now is on a wave. His numbers look good. Mr. President, I can understand that, because you are an excellent politician. You just came back from Europe. You were talking about how everyone was cheering you over there. No wonder they are cheering over in Europe. You are saying we are committing 70 percent of the cost for this, and we are committing 30 percent of our troops to fight with your other troops, to fight your battles for you. That is not our battle over there. That is relative to the security interests of Western Europe and Eastern Europe, not the United States. I saw the accounts on television when President Clinton was talking to the troops over there. I can remember when I was a troop, so I know how a troop thinks. When I was over there talking to those same troops just a few days before the President was there, they had one question. They said, ``What is our mission? Why are we going to this hostile area? Why is the President obsessed in sending us into Bosnia?'' I only say this today. I know we are out of time, Mr. President. I just want to say that it is not over yet. I reemphasize there will be no free rides. There is going to be a vote. Most likely it will be Wednesday, not the vote that the leader has that is going to be a watered-down version of conciliatory remarks about what has gone on over there and about protecting our troops. We all know we are going to support our troops. But this is going to be a vote on, Are we going to have a mass deployment of troops into Bosnia? Yes or no. And every Senator on this floor is going to have to make a record and stand up and say how he feels so that the people at home will know. I do not know, Mr. President, how your calls are coming in in your office back in Tennessee. But I can tell you what mine are in Oklahoma. They are about 100 to 1 against it. That is because there is an infinite wisdom of the people of this country once left alone to make up their mind and make that judgment. It is not a beltway decision. It is not a Washington, DC, decision. It is not the kind of wisdom you get in the White House or within the beltway. It is back in real America where real people, real fathers and mothers are, sons and daughters who are going to be over there, shipped over to this endless war in Bosnia. It is not going to be 12 months, Mr. President. When we were up in the area of Tuzla where our troops are going to be deployed, I said something about 12 months, and they all laughed. They said, ``You mean 12 years.'' This is the time for it to be stopped. If Somalia had been stopped before the murder of the 18 Rangers over there and their mutilated bodies were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu, that would not have happened. This is the time to stop this before the mutilated bodies of Americans are dragged through the streets of Tuzla. I yield the floor. Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. ","['Mr. INHOFE.', ' Mr. ', 'President, I,', ' like many people, have been distressed over the weekend listening to a lot of the comments as to what is going on in Bosnia, and this seems to be--and it is portrayed by this administration that it is--a done deal. Many Republicans and many Democrats are also saying that it is a done deal; that the troops are going to go; the President has made up his mind. The President, back in February 1993, made a commitment of 25,000 American troops on the ground in Bosnia, and he has decided they are going to go. ', 'So I ', 'guess the easy thing is to say, well, the President made the decision; I may not agree with it or I may agree with it but nonetheless the decision is made, and we want to support our troops that are over there. I am really getting tired of the demagoging that is going on about supporting the troops that are over there, as if this thing is a done deal. I grant you, Mr. ', 'President, I ', 'agree that the President of the United States does have the constitutional right to deploy troops. I think it is wrong, and historically it has not been done. The Presidents have come to the American people and have come through Congress for resolutions of approval, and this President has chosen not to do this. Of course, I will remind all America that the House of Representatives, the other body, has already on two occasions expressed itself in a very, very strong vote in opposition to the deployment of ground troops to Bosnia. So we turn on the talk radio shows and we look at the news accounts, and they say, well, it is already a done deal and Congress has no role; Congress is not relevant in this debate. I just do not buy that. I think this is still America, and the American people can be heard, and the best way for the American people to be heard is through their elected representatives. I think we have just a few hours to stop this thing. I am talking now about the mass deployment. Yes, the President has already sent several hundred troops into the area of Tuzla, which is the northeastern sector, in which I had occasion to spend quite a bit of time, and I see an environment which is the most hostile environment that perhaps we have ever had the occasion to deploy any American troop into in the history of this country. We talk about and can identify that there are more than 6 million mines of all shapes and sizes that are out there, and you cannot do anything about rendering those mines harmless because the ground is now frozen and they will not appear really until a heavy vehicle gets on top of them. Of course, we are talking about the deployment of 130 M1 tanks and several other armored vehicles, so it is a very frightening thing. It is a frightening thing to think it is not just a matter of three factions that do not like each other in the former Yugoslavia. It is not just the Serbs and the Croats and the Moslems, because in addition to that you have the Bosnian Serbs, you have the Bosnian Moslems, you have the Arkan Tigers, you have the Black Swans, you have the Afghanistans, you have the Iranians. You have all of these, what we call rogue factions over there. And yet they say it is a done deal. I think it is too easy to say that. I hope that everyone in America will demand that their Senator get on record on this issue. Mr. President, we are going to give them the opportunity to get on record on this issue. Last week, I served notice that there is going to be an up-or-down vote on the sending of troops into Bosnia. It is not a matter of supporting our troops that are there. You bet we support them. I know something about being a troop. I used to be in a troop, and I wanted the support of the American people and got it. I think every Member of this Senate, every Member of the other body, is going to support our troops wherever they are. That is not the issue. That is a copout. The issue is, should they be over there to begin with? I can remember so well when Michael Rose, who was the commanding general of the troops, the U.N. troops, in Bosnia said, if America sends troops over there, they will have more casualties than they had in the Persian Gulf. That was 390. In the Senate Armed Services Committee, when I asked Secretary Perry and Secretary Christopher and General Shalikashvili--I said, ``Is that mission to contain a civil war and to protect the integrity of ', 'NATO ', ""worth more than 400 American lives?'' And Secretary Perry said yes; Secretary Christopher said yes; General Shalikashvili said yes. "", 'But I ', 'say no, because, you see, Mr. President, they were speaking on behalf of the President of the United States, the top people, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and, of course, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. So now we say it is a done deal and that Congress is not relevant. ', 'But I ', 'say we are going to have a vote on this, and people are going to have to be responsible for it. I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that at this point an editorial be printed in the Record, a December 1 editorial by Abraham Sofaer. There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Clinton Needs Congress on Bosnia (By ', 'Abraham D.', "" Sofaer) President Clinton has appealed to Congress and the American people to support his policy committing 20,000 ground troops to implement the peace agreement reached between Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia. It is a tribute to the American people that the president is accorded the greatest deference when he calls for the greatest sacrifice. Americans respond, at least initially, to such appeals from their President. But Mr. Clinton is exploiting this quality. He has presented the agreement and the American role in its enforcement as an accomplished fact, though the documents have yet to be signed by the parties, and numerous preconditions to U.S. involvement have yet to be fulfilled. He is consulting with Congress, but he is already sending troops to the area without any form of legislative approval. Indeed, he claims that, while he would welcome Congress's approval, he plans to go ahead regardless. Presidents often try to get what they want by leading aggressively. Congress nevertheless has a duty to study carefully the proposed operation and then express its view. The essential first step in that debate is to read the documents signed recently in Dayton. The complex agreement, with 12 annexes, calls for Bosnia to remain a single but divided nation, and all the warring factions [["", 'Page S ', ""17879]] to withdraw to specific lines. The agreement covers virtually all aspects of future life in Bosnia, including the division of its governments, the contents of its constitution, the selection of its judges, and the manner in which its police force is to be chosen and trained. Of principal interest to Congress, though, are those aspects of the agreement that create obligations and expectations for the U.S. to fulfill. our obligations These obligations, when carefully examined in context, carry to the ultimate extreme the policy of forcing a settlement on the Bosnians, rather than attempting to create an internal situation that is militarily balanced. Most significantly, the agreement makes the U.S., through the ``implementation force'' ("", 'IFOR)', "", the military guarantor of the overall arrangement. The role of U.S. troops cannot be characterized as ``peacekeeping.'' Even ``implementation'' understates our obligation, "", 'IFOR ', ""will be close to an occupying army, in a conflict that has merely been suspended. We are likely to have as many difficulties acting as occupiers without having won a victory as the U.N.'s war crimes tribunal is having in attempting to apply its decisions in Bosnia without the power to enforce them. "", ""IFOR'"", 's principal responsibilities are set out in Annex 1(a) of the agreement: The parties agree to cease hostilities and to withdraw all forces to agreed lines in three phases. Detailed rules have been agreed upon, including special provisions regarding Sarajevo and Gorazde. ', 'But IFOR ', ""is responsible for marking the cease-fire lines and the ``inter-entity boundary line and its zone of separation,'' which in effect will divide the Bosnian Muslims and Croats from the Bosnian Serbs. The parties agree that "", 'IFOR ', ""may use all necessary force to ensure their compliance with these disengagement rules. The parties agree to ``strictly avoid committing any reprisals, counterattacks, or any unilateral actions in response to violations of this annex by another party.'' The only response allowed to alleged violations is through the procedures provided in "", 'Article VIII ', ""of the Annex, which establishes a ``joint military commission''--made up of all the parties--to consider military complaints, questions and problems. But the commission is only ``a consultative body for the "", 'IFOR ', ""commander,'' an American general who is explicitly deemed ``the final authority in theater regarding interpretation of this agreement. . . .'' This enormous power--to prevent even acts of self defense--will carry proportionate responsibility for harm that any party may attribute to "", ""IFOR'"", 's lack of responsiveness or fairness. ', 'IFOR ', ""is also given the responsibility to support various nonmilitary tasks, including creating conditions for free and fair elections; assisting humanitarian organizations; observing and preventing ``interference with the movement of civilian populations, refugees, and displaced persons''; clearing the roads of mines; controlling all airspace (even for civilian air travel); and ensuring access to all areas unimpeded by checkpoints, roadblocks or other obstacles. Taken together, these duties essentially give "", 'IFOR ', 'control of the physical infrastructure of both parts of the Bosnian state. It seems doubtful that the 60,000-man force could meet these expectations. ', 'Article IX ', ""of the agreement recognizes the ``obligation of all parties to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law.'' This is an especially sensitive matter. Yet there is no mechanism in the accord for bringing to justice men who haven't been defeated in battle and who aren't in custody. This means that "", 'IFOR ', ""is almost certain to come under pressure by victims and human rights advocates to capture and deliver up the principal villains. Will it do better than we did in fulfilling our promise to capture Mohammed Farah Aidid in Somalia? The agreement makes vague promises about reversing ``ethnic cleansing'' by guaranteeing refugees the right to return to their homes. Since this is in practice impossible, the West will end up paying billions in compensation awards promised in the agreement. The agreement contains numerous provisions regarding the manner in which Bosnia is to be governed, with checks and balances built in that are based on ethnic or geographic terms. But Americans traditionally have not believed in such divisions of political authority. We fought the Civil War to put into place an undivided nation based on the principle that all people are of equal worth, and all must live in accordance with the law. It took a Tito to keep the ethnically divided Yugoslavia together. "", 'Will IFOR ', 'now assume his role of enforcing a constitution based on principles abhorrent to Western values? Even if the basic structure of the government works, what role will ', 'IFOR ', ""have to play in resolving disputes over the numerous sensitive areas that the parties have seen fit to write into the accords? If the parties don't resolve some matters successfully, they are likely to blame "", 'IFOR ', ""for these failures. Finally, the agreement draws a vague distinction between ``military'' and ``civilian'' matters. Ultimate authority over the latter is allocated to a U.N. high representative, who is to act through a ``joint civilian commission'' consisting of senior political representatives of the parties and the "", 'IFOR ', 'commander or his representative. The high representative is to exchange information and maintain liaison on a regular basis with ', 'IFOR,', "" and shall attend or be represented at meetings of the joint military commission and offer advice ``particularly on matters of a political- military nature.'' But it is also made clear that the high representative ``shall have no authority over the "", 'IFOR ', 'and shall not in any way interfere in the conduct of military operations or the ', 'IFOR ', ""chain of command.'' This may seem a reassuring confirmation of "", ""IFOR'"", 's power to avoid U.N. restrictions on the use of force. Ultimately, however, ', ""IFOR'"", ""s role could be made untenable if it finds itself in a confrontation with the U.N.'s designated representative about the proper handling of a ``political'' matter. What would happen, for example, if the U.N. high representative determined that U.S. forces had gone too far in defending themselves under President Clinton's policy of effectively responding to attacks ``and then some''? either/or Congress cannot redo the agreement reached by the parties. But there is no need for lawmakers to accept President Clinton's either/or approach--either support his plan to implement the agreement, or pull out entirely. If the agreement represents a genuine desire for peace among the warring parties, then presumably the accord is not so fragile as to depend on the oral commitment of U.S. troops made by the administration (and which isn't even part of the agreement). Congress can and should consider other options. "", 'The U.', ""S., for example, could assist European forces in demarcating the boundary lines, and could enforce peace in the area through the threat of air strikes on important targets. Or the U.S. could offer greater monetary and diplomatic support for the agreement but not any ground troops. Whatever happens with the troop commitment, Congress should insist that the agreement's provisions allowing the training and arming of the Bosnian Muslims be rigorously adhered to. A balance of power among the hostile parties is ultimately the only basis for long-term stability in the region. And if American troops are sent to Bosnia, they will be unable to leave responsibly until such a balance has been developed. That would certainly take longer than the yearlong limit imposed by the administration. "", 'Mr. INHOFE.', "" This is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution who took the time to read the some 12 annexes that we have to this agreement that has been initialed and all that was said. We realize the responsibility that we have in the United States for this so-called peacekeeping effort. But stop and think. This is not peacekeeping; this is peace implementation. There is a little thing called mission creep. We saw it in Vietnam. We saw it in Somalia. It is a thing where you go in and tell the American people, ``We are just keeping peace. There is no war on over there.'' Mr. "", 'President, I ', 'was in the northeast sector of Bosnia. There is a war going on over there. The firing did not stop. The firepower is going on right now.

1,"THE FALL OF SREBRENICA Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise tonight to deplore the fall of the Bosnian City of Srebrenica. Almost 2 years ago, when Srebrenica was under siege in the despicable policy of ethnic cleansing, instigated by President Milosevic of Serbia and executed by General Silajdzic and the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Mr. Karadzic, I met with Mr. Milosevic to attempt to get into Srebrenica. I was unable to do that and went on up to Tuzla where hundreds, eventually thousands, of Bosnian Serbs and Croats were fleeing for their lives with all of their possessions on their back and their families in tow. I met in Tuzla with a man and a woman in their early forties who told me they had to make a very difficult decision as they fled over the mountains into Tuzla from Srebrenica, because they could not get back in. And I was wondering what that terrible decision was they were about to tell me. They pointed out they had left to die on the mountain top in the snow the man's elderly mother who was 81. They had to choose between taking their kids or the mother-in-law, or the wife, who could make it, or no one making it. The Bosnian Serb aggression and Serbian aggression--I know I sound like a broken record, I have been speaking about this for 2 years-- seems to cause very little concern in this country and the world. Mr. President, I think it is time for an immediate and fundamental change in our policy in the former Yugoslavia. Mr. President, the news this morning that the Bosnian Serbs have overrun, finally, Srebrenica, one of the United Nations' so-called safe areas, puts the final nail in the coffin of a bankrupt policy in the former Yugoslavia, begun by the Bush administration and continued with only minor adjustments by the Clinton administration. Given the feckless performance of the United Nations in Bosnia, it is no surprise that the Bosnian Serbs continue to violate several United Nations resolutions, and do it with impunity, and then thumb their nose at the entire world and the peacekeeping force there. In Srebrenica, the United Nations first disarmed the Bosnian Government military. I want to remind everybody of that. The Bosnian Government military was in Srebrenica, as in other safe areas, fighting the onslaught of Serbs with heavy artillery. The solution put forward by the United Nations, after having imposed an embargo on the [[Page S 9709]] Bosnian Government, was to go in and take the weapons from the Bosnian Serbs, the Bosnian military in Srebrenica, in return for a guarantee of protection for six safe areas. That was the deal. It was supposed to be putting the city and the surrounding areas under the protection of the United Nations. Then the United Nations, of course, did not live up to its half of the bargain. Its blue-helmeted peacekeepers were kept lightly armed and, as a consequence, unable to withstand a Bosnian Serb onslaught. NATO air strikes were called for by the Dutch blue hats. The United Nations concluded that this was not a good time to do that. NATO air strikes were eventually called in too late to have any effect. The safe area of Srebrenica proved to be safe only for Serbian aggressors. Srebrenica was filled with thousands of Moslem refugees from elsewhere in eastern Bosnia, the victims of the vile Serbian practice that they refer to as ethnic cleansing, the very people the United Nations pledged to protect in return for them giving up what few weapons they had. The United Nations defaulted on its honor. It has disgraced itself. And these pathetic souls, already once driven from their ancestral homes, are now reportedly fleeing Srebrenica to an uncertain fate in undetermined locations, and I expect many will meet the fate of that family I visited in Tuzla a year and a half ago. Could the United Nations have saved Srebrenica? Of course it could have, if it only allowed NATO to do its job promptly and fully. Perhaps the most frustrating and maddening aspect of the entire catastrophe is the fact that the Bosnian Serbs were able to defy NATO, which has been hobbled by being tied to the timorous U.N. civilian command, led by Mr. Akashi. Mr. President, we must immediately change the course of our policy in the former Yugoslavia. First of all, as I and others have been saying in this Chamber for more than 2 years, we must lift the illegal and immoral arms embargo on the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A resolution to that effect, which I am cosponsoring, will be introduced next week. I am confident that it will pass with a comfortable majority. Mr. President, the fall of Srebrenica has given the lie to pundits in the United States--but especially in Western Europe--who have ceaselessly issued dire warnings that if the United States would unilaterally lift the arms embargo, the Bosnian Serbs would then overrun the eastern enclaves. Well, Mr. President, apparently, someone forgot to explain this causal relationship to the Serbs. I suppose the apostles of appeasement will now say that if we lift the embargo, the Bosnian Serbs will overrun the remaining two enclaves, or maybe Sarajevo, or maybe Western Europe. After all, Mr. President, we have been led to believe that we are facing a juggernaut. That is nonsense. We are talking about a third-rate, poorly motivated, middle-aged force that has to dragoon its reserves from the cafes of Belgrade to fight. In reality, of course, this tiresome rhetoric has been a smokescreen for doing nothing, for sitting back and watching this vile ethnic cleansing, mass rapes, cowardly sniping at children, and other military tactics at which the Bosnian Serbs excel. ``How regrettable,'' the appeasers say publicly. ``But as long as these quarrelsome south Slavs contain their feuding to Bosnia,'' they add, ``then it is nothing to get too exercised about.'' Well, Mr. President, it is something to get exercised about. The geostrategic reality of the 21st century is that the primary danger to peace will most likely come from regional ethnic crises. We must not allow cold-blooded aggressors like Karadzic and Milosevic to get away with their terrorism. Europe, unfortunately, has other potential Karadzics and Milosevics. After we lift the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina, we should immediately put into place a program to train Bosnian Government troops, probably in Croatia. We should make clear that we are not neutral parties in this conflict, we are on the side of the aggrieved party, the Bosnian Government. This does not require a single American troop to set foot in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I have been told time and again that these folks cannot defend themselves. Well, of course they cannot defend themselves, they have no weapons. We should make it clear, Mr. President, that we are no longer signing on to this incredible policy that has been promoted in Europe. We should call an emergency session of the North Atlantic Council and tell our allies that NATO must immediately remove itself from the U.N. chain of command in the former Yugoslavia. The conflict there already constitutes a clear and present danger to the European members of the alliance. NATO does not need the blessing of the United Nations to protect its members' vital interests. Furthermore, we should restate to our NATO allies who have peacekeeping troops in Bosnia and Croatia that we will stand by President Clinton's commitment to extricate them, but only if the entire operation is under the command of the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, a United States general, and only if the operation is fully conducted under NATO rules of engagement. We should give immediate public warning to the Bosnian Serbs and their patrons in Belgrade that any further locking-on of radar to American planes flying over Bosnia will be cause for total destruction of the Bosnian Serb radar facilities, which is fully, totally within our capacity to do. Serbia should be given fair warning that if it tries to intervene, it, too, will receive immediate and disproportionate attacks on Serbia proper. There is no reason why our British, French, Dutch, and other NATO allies should object to this policy. If, however, Mr. President, they do not wish to follow our lead, then we should remind them that four years ago they wanted to handle this southern European problem themselves. And we should say, ``Well, good luck, it is now your problem, handle it.'' I do not think for a minute, Mr. President, they will take on that responsibility. It is about time this President and this administration understands that we either should do it our way or get out. Mr. President, nothing good can come out of this latest fiasco in Bosnia. The United Nations has been definitively discredited. NATO has been defied. As usual, defenseless and blameless Bosnian Moslems have been brutalized. This madness must stop, Mr. President. We must change our policy immediately. Tomorrow is not soon enough. I yield the floor. Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to join in the comments of my distinguished colleague from Delaware. I could not agree with him more concerning the events of recent hours, and as far as our policies are concerned concerning those events in that part of the country. What concerns me most about all of this is the credibility of the United States of America. I am beginning to wonder if we have any credibility in any part of the world anymore. Following the disastrous U.N. lead, and to a certain extent the NATO lead there, not getting them to go along with sound policies and lifting the arms embargo with their cooperation, one sad tale after another, we have gone down a road of totally participating in the discrediting of the United Nations, of NATO, and our own country. I think that the first step toward rectifying that certainly is not putting our own troops in there, but letting the people defend themselves, which is all they say they want to do, lifting that arms embargo, stepping back and saying, ``It is your problem. You solve it. You take care of it.'' That is what they deserve to do. We cannot afford to stand by, through our policies, and let this murderous activity go on, and say to the world that we, the strongest power in the world, supposedly are going to countenance that sort of thing and not use the many resources, short of troops on the ground, that we have, to do something about such terrible activities.

Mr. President, I rise tonight to deplore the fall of the Bosnian City of Srebrenica. Almost 2 years ago, when Srebrenica was under siege in the despicable policy of ethnic cleansing, instigated by President Milosevic of Serbia and executed by General Silajdzic and the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Mr. Karadzic, I met with Mr. Milosevic to attempt to get into Srebrenica. I was unable to do that and went on up to Tuzla where hundreds, eventually thousands, of Bosnian Serbs and Croats were fleeing for their lives with all of their possessions on their back and their families in tow. I met in Tuzla with a man and a woman in their early forties who told me they had to make a very difficult decision as they fled over the mountains into Tuzla from Srebrenica, because they could not get back in. And I was wondering what that terrible decision was they were about to tell me. They pointed out they had left to die on the mountain top in the snow the man's elderly mother who was 81. They had to choose between taking their kids or the mother-in-law, or the wife, who could make it, or no one making it. The Bosnian Serb aggression and Serbian aggression--I know I sound like a broken record, I have been speaking about this for 2 years-- seems to cause very little concern in this country and the world. Mr. President, I think it is time for an immediate and fundamental change in our policy in the former Yugoslavia. Mr. President, the news this morning that the Bosnian Serbs have overrun, finally, Srebrenica, one of the United Nations' so-called safe areas, puts the final nail in the coffin of a bankrupt policy in the former Yugoslavia, begun by the Bush administration and continued with only minor adjustments by the Clinton administration. Given the feckless performance of the United Nations in Bosnia, it is no surprise that the Bosnian Serbs continue to violate several United Nations resolutions, and do it with impunity, and then thumb their nose at the entire world and the peacekeeping force there. In Srebrenica, the United Nations first disarmed the Bosnian Government military. I want to remind everybody of that. The Bosnian Government military was in Srebrenica, as in other safe areas, fighting the onslaught of Serbs with heavy artillery. The solution put forward by the United Nations, after having imposed an embargo on the [[Page S 9709]] Bosnian Government, was to go in and take the weapons from the Bosnian Serbs, the Bosnian military in Srebrenica, in return for a guarantee of protection for six safe areas. That was the deal. It was supposed to be putting the city and the surrounding areas under the protection of the United Nations. Then the United Nations, of course, did not live up to its half of the bargain. Its blue-helmeted peacekeepers were kept lightly armed and, as a consequence, unable to withstand a Bosnian Serb onslaught. NATO air strikes were called for by the Dutch blue hats. The United Nations concluded that this was not a good time to do that. NATO air strikes were eventually called in too late to have any effect. The safe area of Srebrenica proved to be safe only for Serbian aggressors. Srebrenica was filled with thousands of Moslem refugees from elsewhere in eastern Bosnia, the victims of the vile Serbian practice that they refer to as ethnic cleansing, the very people the United Nations pledged to protect in return for them giving up what few weapons they had. The United Nations defaulted on its honor. It has disgraced itself. And these pathetic souls, already once driven from their ancestral homes, are now reportedly fleeing Srebrenica to an uncertain fate in undetermined locations, and I expect many will meet the fate of that family I visited in Tuzla a year and a half ago. Could the United Nations have saved Srebrenica? Of course it could have, if it only allowed NATO to do its job promptly and fully. Perhaps the most frustrating and maddening aspect of the entire catastrophe is the fact that the Bosnian Serbs were able to defy NATO, which has been hobbled by being tied to the timorous U.N. civilian command, led by Mr. Akashi. Mr. President, we must immediately change the course of our policy in the former Yugoslavia. First of all, as I and others have been saying in this Chamber for more than 2 years, we must lift the illegal and immoral arms embargo on the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A resolution to that effect, which I am cosponsoring, will be introduced next week. I am confident that it will pass with a comfortable majority. Mr. President, the fall of Srebrenica has given the lie to pundits in the United States--but especially in Western Europe--who have ceaselessly issued dire warnings that if the United States would unilaterally lift the arms embargo, the Bosnian Serbs would then overrun the eastern enclaves. Well, Mr. President, apparently, someone forgot to explain this causal relationship to the Serbs. I suppose the apostles of appeasement will now say that if we lift the embargo, the Bosnian Serbs will overrun the remaining two enclaves, or maybe Sarajevo, or maybe Western Europe. After all, Mr. President, we have been led to believe that we are facing a juggernaut. That is nonsense. We are talking about a third-rate, poorly motivated, middle-aged force that has to dragoon its reserves from the cafes of Belgrade to fight. In reality, of course, this tiresome rhetoric has been a smokescreen for doing nothing, for sitting back and watching this vile ethnic cleansing, mass rapes, cowardly sniping at children, and other military tactics at which the Bosnian Serbs excel. ``How regrettable,'' the appeasers say publicly. ``But as long as these quarrelsome south Slavs contain their feuding to Bosnia,'' they add, ``then it is nothing to get too exercised about.'' Well, Mr. President, it is something to get exercised about. The geostrategic reality of the 21st century is that the primary danger to peace will most likely come from regional ethnic crises. We must not allow cold-blooded aggressors like Karadzic and Milosevic to get away with their terrorism. Europe, unfortunately, has other potential Karadzics and Milosevics. After we lift the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina, we should immediately put into place a program to train Bosnian Government troops, probably in Croatia. We should make clear that we are not neutral parties in this conflict, we are on the side of the aggrieved party, the Bosnian Government. This does not require a single American troop to set foot in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I have been told time and again that these folks cannot defend themselves. Well, of course they cannot defend themselves, they have no weapons. We should make it clear, Mr. President, that we are no longer signing on to this incredible policy that has been promoted in Europe. We should call an emergency session of the North Atlantic Council and tell our allies that NATO must immediately remove itself from the U.N. chain of command in the former Yugoslavia.

2,"QUESTIONS CONCERNING TROOPS IN BOSNIA REMAIN ______ HON. DOUG BEREUTER of nebraska in the house of representatives Thursday, November 30, 1995 Mr. BEREUTER. Mr. Speaker, this Member commends to his colleagues an editorial which appeared in the Omaha World-Herald on November 29, 1995. Speech Didn't Build Confidence; Questions About Bosnia Remain People who looked for a specific, confidence-building explanation for sending American troops to Bosnia were entitled to be disappointed with President Clinton's speech Monday night. Clinton addressed the nation to seek support for his proposal to send 20,000 troops into an arena where political, ethnic and religious factions have been waging war for centuries. He said 20,000 troops are needed to help NATO enforce the peace agreement negotiated at Dayton, Ohio, by the presidents of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia. The president was unconvincing even on the central question of why the national interest requires placing American men and women on the ground in the middle of this ancient conflict. (The U.S. Air Force and Navy already are heavily involved.) Yes, as he said, America has ideals. Yes, it has fought in Europe twice before to ``triumph over tyranny.'' Yes, it has certain international responsibilities that come with being the world's most powerful nation. And certainly the suffering of innocent civilians in Bosnia-Herzegovina has touched hearts around the world. But a recitation of those facts doesn't constitute a reasoned argument for putting American ground troops in extreme peril. This isn't World War I, when America came to the aid of Western democracies to prevent their being crushed by imperial powers. Neither is it World War II, when America entered and ultimately led the great struggle to prevent the Nazis and fascists from enslaving a good part of the world. The conflict in the Balkans is a regional problem. No one has demonstrated that it is a threat to Western civilization in general or to America's national interests. The president said, ``We're all vulnerable to the organized forces of intolerance and destruction, terrorism, ethnic, religious and regional rivalries, the spread of organized crime and weapons on mass destruction and drug trafficking. Just as surely as fascism and communism, these forces also threaten freedom and democracy, peace and prosperity. And they, too, demand American leadership.'' Few would question the world's vulnerability to those forces. But what does any of that have to do with sending U.S. troops to Bosnia? If these ``organized forces'' are the primary reason for committing troops, why doesn't the United States have an infantry division in Rwanda, in Northern Ireland, in India, in Pakistan? Clinton said the Americans would fight back if attacked. ``We will fight fire with fire, and then some,'' he said. Clinton said the mission would take about a year. How does anybody know that? As * * * noted, animosities have been known to lie dormant in the Balkans for years, then break out in bitter, bloody warfare. What guarantee does Clinton have that fighting wouldn't resume as soon as the Americans left? What assurances does he offer that the mission won't go on indefinitely? How could anybody be sure that the fighting wouldn't escalate if American troops were attacked and forced to defend themselves? In promising that the troops would help restore normal life for the people of Bosnia, Clinton made it sound as though the people of Bosnia were one society. They are badly divided, however. What Clinton didn't say is that the peace treaty, to accommodate the fact that the factions detest each other deeply, provides for the partition of the country into a Bosnian-Serb sector and a Muslim-Croat sector. * * * ",https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/30/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/e2271-2?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22croatian%22%2C%22croatian%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1204,QUESTIONS CONCERNING TROOPS IN BOSNIA REMAIN,"______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I too am deeply concerned about the President's announced commitment to deploy 20,000 United States ground troops in Bosnia. I do not believe, Mr. Speaker, that document has articulated a compelling national interest in Bosnia worth the loss of American soldiers. We have no overriding national interest in Bosnia, and there is absolutely no reason American troops should be placed in harm's way as part of an ill-defined mission there. Mr. Speaker, calling this mission a peacekeeping mission is a misnomer. This is a tenuous peace at best, and a potential quagmire for our troops at worst. This is clearly not a legitimate peacekeeping mission, or 240,000 troops would not be required. Yes, I say 240,500, as the spokesperson at the Pentagon was quoted in Defense News today, counting the support troops. We hear the number 60,000, including 20,000 American servicemen and women, but the total number of troops, according to this statement today, is 240,000 troops. Mr. Speaker, this mission goes way beyond peacekeeping to nation building. History should have taught us that we cannot build a nation from the outside. Mr. Speaker, I ask, how much longer can the United States be denying a one-one number for the rest of the world? This is a European conflict, and using United States troops as a global peace force is neither a defensible function nor a practicing pragmatic reality for our military. Using our troops as a global police force in my judgment, and I say this respectfully, but I believe that it reflects a basic misunderstanding of our military's historic mission and capabilities. {time} 2030 Mr. Speaker, this situation is fraught with danger. Our troops will be sitting ducks, literally, physically, sitting ducks, positioned between the two warring factions. Mr. Speaker, I think we have to recognize what is going on, what the political realities are in this part of the world. This is a war that has been going on for ethnic strife for 4,000 years. The present fighting has been going on for 40 years and longer. [[Page H 13710]] Just today, just today, the Serb leader, Karadzic, and the mayors of the Sarajevo suburbs held a protest march; and some of the things they were saying, and I am quoting now, that the Dayton Agreement has created a new Beirut in Europe, referring of course to Lebanon's 15- year civil war, and that there will be bloodshed for centuries to come, that the ethnic Serbs will not be dominated by the Croats and the Moslems, that this is a Balkan powder keg. We all know, Mr. Speaker, there are 6 million land mines waiting in the former Yugoslavia for our troops. Sixty thousand ethnic Serbs, according to Karadzic, will have grenades in their pockets. Well, Mr. Speaker, we have to be aware of these dangers. The President mentioned the unspeakable human rights' violations. Certainly these crimes against humanity are as loathsome as any in the history of the world. But, Mr. Speaker, similar crimes have been documented by Amnesty International in 58 other countries. Why not Afghanistan? Why not go to Rwanda, to China, to Cuba, and all of the other countries in which similar crimes are being perpetrated against humanity? Mr. Speaker, this mission is a logistical nightmare and will be extremely dangerous for U.S. troops who will be potentially under fire from all three factions. Mr. Speaker, what is the solution here in this very complex and difficult situation? I would ask unanimous consent to submit for the Record, and I would commend all of my colleagues' attention to this editorial from today's Wall Street Journal, November 28, 1995, by two former Under Secretaries of Defense. Let me quote from this very provocative and profound piece: The goal of U.S. policy toward Bosnia should be Bosnian self-reliance. We should aim to make it possible for the Bosnian government to defend its own country militarily. Congress should oppose the deployment of U.S. forces to Bosnia unless the administration make clear and binding commitment to create, by arming and training Bosnian Federation forces, a qualitative military balance between Bosnian-Croatian and Serb forces in the former Yugoslavia. Mr. Speaker, that criterion has not been met. This article goes on to say, very wisely, Unfortunately, the Daytona Accords lack clear commitments to equip and train the Bosnian forces. Administration statements are disturbingly ambiguous on this point. This piece concludes by saying, If we are unable to help put the Bosnian government in a position to defend itself, the administration will find, when it wants to withdraw our forces after a year or so, that if cannot do so without triggering a catastrophe. This piece is written by two people who served in previous administrations in the Defense Department who know about what they are writing. Mr. Speaker, I hope and pray that the Congress will have its say on behalf of the American people before this deployment is made. I fear that we will not have such a voice in this deployment. I think each one of us here in this body, in the people's House, needs to examine our consciences, needs to listen to the people we represent and press this issue in the people's House. I know in Minnesota, in the Third District, my calls in the last 2 days have run 178 to 2 against this deployment. Mr. Speaker, I offer for the Record the following article which I referred to earlier. [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 28, 1995] The Argument Clinton Isn't Making on Bosnia (By Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas J. Feith) Having committed an armored division of American ``peacekeepers'' for Bosnia with little analysis and even less consultation, the Clinton administration now contends that Congress has no responsible choice but to concur. To be sure, if it repudiates the president's troop commitment, Congress would be blamed for bringing about resumption of the war, a collapse of American leadership in NATO and perhaps of the alliance itself, and a dangerous perception around the world of the U.S. becoming isolationist and unreliable. But even worse than not backing the president's commitment would be for Congress to approve uncritically a flawed policy that could fail disastrously. Congress has a duty to try to force the administration to define sensible goals for the mission. Americans remember Lebanon and Somalia, where we managed to lose both men and credibility. we remain dubious of the operation in Haiti, which may succeed in restoring dictatorship rather than democracy. If U.S. troops end their Bosnia mission without having achieved what they came to do, especially if they take significant casualties, the consequences will be graver by far. little guidance The administration acknowledges the problem by stressing that U.S. troops will not be deployed unless there is a peace to enforce. But this rather sensible condition for getting in gives little guidance for how and when to get out. There is one compelling rationale for U.S. participation in the international peacekeeping force: Bosnia has been the victim of international aggression and of crimes against humanity that the Bosnian Serbs, supported by the Milosevic regime in Belgrade, have committed against hundreds of thousands of predominantly Muslim Bosnians. The U.S. and our European allies and others bear a large measure of responsibility for these horrors because we have maintained an international arms embargo on Bosnia. The Bosnian government's troops have numerical superiority over their enemies, but, as a result of the embargo, they have remained inferior in equipment, especially heavy armor and artillery. The goal of U.S. policy toward Bosnia should be Bosnian self-reliance. We should aim to make it possible for the Bosnian government to defend its own country militarily. Congress should oppose the deployment of U.S. forces to Bosnia unless the administration makes a clear and binding commitment to create, by arming and training Bosnian Federation forces, a qualitative military balance between Bosnian-Croatian and Serb forces in the former Yugoslavia. If the peacekeeping force is conceived as a means of keeping Bosnia subject to unrealistic arms limitation schemes, and therefore doomed to remain a ward of NATO or the U.S., Congress should oppose it. But if peacekeepers are intended to deter aggression for the year or so needed for the Bosnian government to move toward self-reliance in the defense field, then the strategic and moral case for U.S. participation should be easier for Americans to credit. Unfortunately, the Dayton Accords lack clear commitments to equip and train the Bosnian forces. Administration statements are disturbingly ambiguous on this point. U.S. officials say they have assured the Bosnians that federation forces will be equipped and trained, but that assurance itself is hedged by a misplaced faith that new arms control agreements might make it unnecessary. According to the accords, no weapons will be delivered for 90 days and no heavy weapons for 180 days, pending arms control talks. Also, U.S. statements make it clear that we will try to get others to do the equipping and training. (It is not reassuring that we still lack a good estimate of Bosnian requirements, even though for three years the Clinton administration said that it aimed to lift the arms embargo.) These limitations imply that moving quickly or openly to arm the Bosnians would be destabilizing, but the opposite is true. To ensure a stable Bosnia and to be able to withdraw our troops on schedule, we must be committed, publicly and resolutely, to a rapid equip-and-train program. (Defensive systems not covered by the envisioned arms control regime, such as anti-tank missiles and counter-battery radars, are needed with particular urgency, given the precarious position of Sarajevo.) The administration's hesitations seem to reflect a belief that equipping and training federation forces would be inconsistent with a ``neutral'' role for American peacekeepers. It is important, however, to see clearly the purpose of the peacekeeping force: It must uphold the peace agreement generally, but it is intended also to deter the Serbs from taking advantage of their current (temporary) advantage in armaments. It is not correct or constructive to talk of the peacekeepers as ``neutral.'' They do not have to be neutral to perform their mission any more than police have to be neutral as between shopkeepers and robbers. In fact, pretending to be neutral when none of the parties so regards us actually increases the danger to U.S. forces at a tactical level, by making it more difficult for them to decide how to respond to provocations or ambiguous situations on the ground. It was this posture that helped produce the inadequate security precautions taken by U.S. Marines in Beirut. The best way to shore up the peace is through a policy that deters Serbian aggression and secures Bosnian compliance through American support and cooperation. exit strategy If the administration is to allay public and congressional skepticism about the troop deployment, it must make clear that arming and training Bosnian Federation forces is not only consistent with our role in the peacekeeping force, it is also the key to the ``exit strategy'' for our troops. If we are unable to help put the Bosnian government in a position to defend itself, the administration will find, when it wants to withdraw our forces after a year or so, that it cannot do so without triggering a catastrophe.

4,"UNITED STATES TROOPS IN BOSNIA Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue that all of us are concerned about and all of us are thinking about, and that is the President's policy to put United States troops on the ground in Bosnia. First, let me make it clear that I am opposed to that idea. I had an opportunity about 5 weeks ago to go to Sarajevo along with some other of my associates here. We went to Stuttgart in [[Page S 18058]] Germany and visited for a day with the supreme commander there. I was impressed by the preparation, by the way, of our military, as always. I am sure they will be able to carry out whatever mission is assigned to them. We spent some time in Croatia talking particularly to the Defense Minister there in terms of the Croatians' activities and their concerns. We spent a portion of our time in Sarajevo where we visited with the President of Bosnia, had a chance to talk with the U.N. commander there, and also spent some time coming back through Brussels in Belgium, and spent some time with the NATO commander and all 16 of the Ambassadors that were there. Certainly, I am not an expert in the field, having been there just a few days, but I have to tell you that you do get a sense, you do get a sense from being there as to what the feelings are, a sense that, as you would imagine, those people are tired of fighting and looking for some resolution. You get a feeling, also, however, that there is not a willingness to give up some of the positions that people have taken and will maintain, antagonistic positions and conflicts that are very long lasting and have been there for hundreds of years. So, Mr. President, I came back having not changed my opinion. I do think we need to continue to be involved. I think we have had an excellent representation there in terms of the negotiation. I congratulate the negotiators. We met yesterday with Secretary Holbrooke. But I was no more convinced of the responsibility to have 20,000 or 30,000 troops on the ground there and of our chances of coming away in the period of time, as described by the President, of 1 year, or that the solution is any better than it was before. Let me say, however, that we are going to have differences of view here. I hope we have an extended discussion of the issue here on the floor. I think everyone who comes forward will honestly have their views--and I do not impugn anyone's motives as to why they are where they are. Let me comment on a number of things that have concerned me. One is the process and the process of involving American citizens, through their Congress, through their elected representatives, in this decision. And I have to tell you that it is my observation that the Congress has essentially been co-opted in this decision. It started some 2 years ago when the President, for whatever the reason, indicated that he would place 25,000 troops in Bosnia, at that time mostly to remove the U.N. forces if that was necessary. So that was the first indication why it was 25,000. Why it was not 20,000, why it was not 40,000, why it was not 10,000, I am not sure. No one has ever been able to tell us that. So, then not much happened, and the Congress then passed resolutions saying we ought to lift the arms embargo on the Moslems. However, that was not pushed by the administration. That was not something that the administration worked hard to encourage. But shortly thereafter, I think it did cause some action. Shortly thereafter, the United States then moved to get NATO to do some airstrikes, which tended to bring together then the Croatians and the Moslems to a federation that sort of equalized, began to equalize the forces there, and so we saw a change, I think prompted, at least partially, by the action of this Congress to recommend that we lift the arms embargo. So then we saw some effort to come to a peace agreement. When I was there, there was just recently installed a cease-fire. I think it was the 31st cease-fire, however. Nevertheless, it was an effort to do that. Then we moved toward the peace agreement and a meeting in Dayton, OH, or wherever, to do that. So the administration said, gosh, we cannot really talk to you about what is in the wind here because we are having a peace conference and it would disrupt the peace conference. We had a number of hearings, and we did not get too much information, because they said we cannot do that. So then, for whatever commitment there is to it, there was a peace agreement initialed in Ohio. I am glad there was and I congratulate those who helped bring it about. No one is certain what it means and how much commitment there is to it. Then we are told by the administration, ``Well, we have a peace arrangement now. We can't really talk to you much because we can't change that.'' The next thing we knew, the President was in Europe on a peace mission talking to a number of countries, including NATO and European countries, saying, ``We are willing to bring these troops in.'' Of course, it was received with a great deal of enthusiasm. Who would not? If we agreed to do most of the heavy lifting, you would imagine that. So then following that comes the commitment for troops, and some preliminary troops are there now. Mr. President--and I asked this question of the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense in a hearing last week--what is the role of Congress? I did not get an answer, other than provide the money. I do not think that is appropriate. I do not want to get into the great discussions of the constitutionality of the President's authority. There is disagreement about that. I do not happen to think the President has unlimited authority because he is named Commander in Chief in the Constitution. Nevertheless, there must be a role here for the Congress. I think it has been handled very poorly, frankly, in terms of some involvement and commitment. It seems to me--and I am sorry for this--it seems to me the administration is more in the posture of defending their decision and winning the argument than really talking about the substance of why we should, in fact, be in Bosnia. We can talk about details, and that is what we hear, all the details of how we are going to train, how we are going to move, all these things, but the real issue is not the details, as important as they may be. The real issue is, why are we there and what is the rationale and reason and the vital American interests for us to be there. We hear some saying, ``Well, we're going to put troops in harm's way.'' Of course, no one wants to put troops in harm's way. On the other hand, that is what troops are for. The question is not are they in harm's way, the question is, is there a good reason and rationale for them being in harm's way? We hear, ``If they don't go, there will not be any peace.'' I am not sure that is true. Until these warring parties are prepared, genuinely, to have peace, I suspect there will not be peace. We are told, and I think sincerely, that we are there to keep peace, not to make peace. There is a little different term this time, it is called enforce peace, which is a bit hard to define. But when we asked the question, what do we do when there is an organized military resistance to the U.S. forces that are there, NATO forces, the answer was, ``Well, we're not there to fight a war, we're not there to fight, we are there to keep and enforce the peace.'' We were led to believe we probably would withdraw. So, Mr. President, it is awfully hard to know. Some say, ``Well, we have to have leadership, we're isolationists.'' I do not believe for 1 second that anyone can think of this country, the things we are involved in both in security and trade, that would cause anyone to suggest this country is isolationist. That is ridiculous. Some say, ``Well, NATO will dissolve without us.'' I do not believe that. NATO was designed, of course, to bring together the North Atlantic nations to resist the Soviet Union, and they still have a mission, certainly. Although I must tell you, having been there, I think there is some search for a mission going on. NATO will continue to exist; NATO has a legitimate purpose. I do not know whether its purpose is to quell civil wars within Europe. So, Mr. President, we are in a sticky wicket here, and I guess the stickiest thing--and I, frankly, did not get a chance to ask the Secretary yesterday--is, what is our policy in the future, what is our position going to be with regard to our role in civil disturbances, our role in civil wars, our role in ethnic disturbances throughout the world, and there have been a number and there will continue to be. Is our role to place troops and keep the peace, enforce the peace? I do not know the answer. But we will have to make a decision with respect to policy, so that we know where we are, what people can expect from us. We want to be a leader in the world; we will be, we [[Page S 18059]] should be, we are the superpower. People should have, however, a reason to anticipate that our position will be based on policy. Mr. President, I think we find ourselves in a very difficult position, one in which honest people can disagree. I happen to believe it is a mistake for us to put U.S. troops on the ground there, a mistake in terms of policy, a mistake in terms of alternatives. There are alternatives. It is not that or nothing. We can continue to be involved with diplomacy. We can continue to support NATO. We can give other kinds of support there. It is a question of what happens when we leave. What do we do to ensure that having spent whatever it is--I suspect even though the administration says $1.5 billion, maybe plus $600 million in nation building, a little over $2 billion, I would be willing to bet you that is not right. We spent nearly that much in Haiti, and this place will be three times as expensive. So the question is, what is the basis, what is the rationale for that kind of commitment? I hope we have an opportunity to discuss it soon. I had hoped we would this week. Apparently, it will be next week. We ought to keep in mind the mass troop movement has not taken place. We have some folks in there, some troops in there early to prepare, but the troops are not there. We still need to make a decision. We still need to say to the President, if that is what we believe, that we think this is the wrong decision. No one here, however, will resist supporting troops once they are there. We are not talking about that at this point; we are talking about the decision to be there. It is a tough one. We should face up to it, come to the snubbing post and make decisions. I am sorry we have not made them before now. We shall. It is our responsibility. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue that all of us are concerned about and all of us are thinking about, and that is the President's policy to put United States troops on the ground in Bosnia. First, let me make it clear that I am opposed to that idea. I had an opportunity about 5 weeks ago to go to Sarajevo along with some other of my associates here. We went to Stuttgart in [[Page S 18058]] Germany and visited for a day with the supreme commander there. I was impressed by the preparation, by the way, of our military, as always. I am sure they will be able to carry out whatever mission is assigned to them.

5,"[[Page H 7100]] REPORT ON CONTINUING NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA AND THE BOSNIAN SERBS--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. 104-101) The Speaker pro tempore laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States, which was read and, together with the accompanying papers, without objection, referred to the Committee on International Relations and ordered to be printed. To the Congress of the United States: On May 30, 1992, in Executive Order No. 12808, the President declared a national emergency to deal with the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States arising from actions and policies of the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro, acting under the name of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, in their involvement in and support for groups attempting to seize territory in Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina by force and violence utilizing, in part, the forces of the so-called Yugoslav National Army (57 FR 23299, June 2, 1992). I expanded the national emergency in Executive Order No. 12934 of October 25, 1994, to address the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control. The present report is submitted pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1641(c) and 1703(c). It discusses Administration actions and expenses directly related to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order No. 12808 and Executive Order No. 12934 and to expanded sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) (the ``FRY (S/M)'') and the Bosnian Serbs contained in Executive Order No. 12810 of June 5, 1992 (57 FR 24347, June 9, 1992), Executive Order No. 12831 of January 15, 1993 (58 FR 5253, Jan. 21, 1993), Executive Order No. 12846 of April 25, 1993 (58 FR 25771, April 27, 1993), and Executive Order No. 12934 of October 25, 1994 (59 FR 54117, October 27, 1994). 1. Executive Order No. 12808 blocked all property and interests in property of the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro, or held in the name of the former Government of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, then or thereafter located in the United States or within the possession or control of U.S. persons, including their overseas branches. Subsequently, Executive Order No. 12810 expanded U.S. actions to implement in the United States the United Nations sanctions against the FRY (S/M) adopted in United Nations Security Council (``UNSC'') Resolution 757 of May 30, 1992. In addition to reaffirming the blocking of FRY (S/M) Government property, this order prohibited transactions with respect to the FRY (S/M) involving imports, exports, dealing in FRY-origin property, air and sea transportation, contract performance, funds transfers, activity promoting importation or exportation or dealings in property, and official sports, scientific, technical, or other cultural representation of, or sponsorship by, the FRY (S/M) in the United States. Executive Order No. 12810 exempted from trade restrictions (1) transshipments through the FRY (S/M), and (2) activities related to the United Nations Protection Force (``UNPROFOR''), the Conference on Yugoslavia, or the European Community Monitor Mission. On January 15, 1993, President Bush issued Executive Order No. 12831 to implement new sanctions contained in U.N. Security Council Resolution 787 of November 16, 1992. The order revoked the exemption for transshipments through the FRY (S/M) contained in Executive Order No. 12810, prohibited transactions within the United States or by a U.S. person relating to FRY (S/M) vessels and vessels in which a majority or controlling interest is held by a person or entity in, or operating from, the FRY (S/M), and stated that all such vessels shall be considered as vessels of the FRY (S/M), regardless of the flag under which they sail. On April 25, 1993, I issued Executive Order No. 12846 to implement in the United States the sanctions adopted in UNSC Resolution 820 of April 17, 1993. That resolution called on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen peace plan for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and, if they failed to do so by April 26, called on member states to take additional measures to tighten the embargo against the FRY (S/M) and Serbian controlled areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the United Nations Protected Areas in Croatia. Effective April 26, 1993, the order blocked all property and interests in property of commercial, industrial, or public utility undertakings or entities organized or located in the FRY (S/M), including property and interests in property of entities (wherever organized or located) owned or controlled by such undertakings or entities, that are or thereafter come within the possession or control of U.S. persons. On October 25, 1994, in view of UNSC Resolution 942 of September 23, 1994, I issued Executive Order No. 12934 in order to take additional steps with respect to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. (59 FR 54117, October 27, 1994.) Executive Order No. 12934 expands the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12808 to address the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the territory in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control, including their refusal to accept the proposed territorial settlement of the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Executive order blocks all property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of United States persons (including their overseas branches) of: (1) the Bosnian Serb military and paramilitary forces and the authorities in areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of those forces; (2) any entity, including any commercial, industrial, or public utility undertaking, organized or located in those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces; (3) any entity, wherever organized or located, which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by any person in, or resident in, those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces; and (4) any person acting for or on behalf of any person within the scope of the above definitions. The Executive order also prohibits the provision or exportation of services to those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces, or to any person for the purpose of any business carried on in those areas, either from the United States or by a U.S. person. The order also prohibits the entry of any U.S.- flagged vessel, other than a U.S. naval vessel, into the riverine ports of those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnia Serb forces. Finally, any transaction by any U.S. person that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in the order is prohibited. Executive Order No. 12934 became effective at 11:59 p.m., e.d.t., on October 25, 1994. 2. The declaration of the national emergency on May 30, 1992, was made pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code. The emergency declaration was reported to the Congress on May 30, 1992, pursuant to section 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(b)) and the expansion of that National Emergency under the same authorities was reported to the Congress on October 25, 1994. The additional sanctions set forth in related Executive orders were imposed pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the statutes cited [[Page H 7101]] above, section 1114 of the Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C. App. 1514), and section 5 of the United Nations Participation Act (22 U.S.C. 287c). 3. There have been no amendments to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) Sanctions Regulations (the ``Regulations''), 31 C.F.R. Part 585, since the last report. The Treasury Department had previously published 853 names in the Federal Register on November 17, 1994 (59 FR 59460), as part of a comprehensive listing of all blocked persons and specially designated nationals (``SDNs'') of the FRY (S/M). This list identified individuals and entities determined by the Department of the Treasury to be owned or controlled by or acting for or on behalf of the Government of the FRY (S/M), persons in the FRY (S/M), or entities located or organized in or controlled from the FRY (S/M). All prohibitions in the Regulations pertaining to the Government of the FRY (S/M) apply to the entities and individuals identified. U.S. persons, on notice of the status of such blocked persons and specially designated nationals, are prohibited from entering into transactions with them, or transactions in which they have an interest, unless otherwise exempted or authorized pursuant to the Regulations. On February 22, 1995, pursuant to Executive Order 12934 and the Regulations, Treasury identified 85 individuals as leaders of the Bosnian Serb forces or civilian authorities in the territories in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control. Also on February 22, Treasury designated 19 individuals and 23 companies as SDNs of the FRY (S/M). These designations include FRY (S/M)-connected companies around the world that are being directed from Cyprus, two Cypriot-owned firms that have had a central role in helping establish and sustain sanctions-evading FRY (S/M) front companies in Cyprus, and the head of the FRY (S/M)'s Central Bank who is also the architect of the FRY (S/M) economic program. Additionally, on March 13, 1995, Treasury named 32 firms and eight individuals that are part of the Karic Brothers' family network of companies as SDNs of the FRY (S/M). Their enterprises span the globe and are especially active in former East Bloc countries. These additions and amendments, published in the Federal Register on April 18, 1995 (60 FR 19448), bring the current total of Blocked Entities and SDNs of the FRY (S/M) to 938 and the total number of individuals identified as leaders of the Bosnian Serb military or paramilitary forces or civilian authorities in the territories in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control to 85. A copy of the notice is attached. Treasury's blocking authority as applied to FRY (S/M) subsidiaries and vessels in the United States has been challenged in court. In Milena Ship Management Company, Ltd. v. Newcomb, 804 F.Supp. 846, 855, and 859 (E.D.L.A. 1992) aff'd, 995 F.2d 620 (5th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S.Ct. 877 (1994), involving five ships owned or controlled by FRY (S/M) entities blocked in various U.S. ports, the blocking authority as applied to these vessels was upheld. In IPT Company, Inc. v. United States Department of the Treasury, No. 92 CIV 5542 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), the district court also upheld the blocking authority as applied to the property of a Yugoslav subsidiary located in the United States. The latter case is currently on appeal to the Second Circuit. 4. Over the past 6 months, the Departments of State and Treasury have worked closely with European Union (the ``EU'') member states and other U.N. member nations to coordinate implementation of the U.N. sanctions against the FRY (S/M). This has included visits by assessment teams formed under the auspices of the United States, the EU, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (the ``OSCE'') to states bordering on Serbia and Montenegro; continued deployment of OSCE sanctions assistance missions (``SAMs'') to Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine to assist in monitoring land and Danube River traffic; support for the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia (``ICFY'') monitoring missions along the Serbia-Montenegro-Bosnia border; bilateral contacts between the United States and other countries for the purpose of tightening financial and trade restrictions on the FRY (S/M); and ongoing multilateral meetings by financial sanctions enforcement authorities from various countries to coordinate enforcement efforts and to exchange technical information. 5. In accordance with licensing policy and the Regulations, FAC has exercised its authority to license certain specific transactions with respect to the FRY (S/M) that are consistent with U.S. foreign policy and the Security Council sanctions. During the reporting period, FAC has issued 109 specific licenses regarding transactions pertaining to the FRY (S/M) or assets it owns or controls, bringing the total as of April 25, 1995, to 930. Specific licenses have been issued (1) for payment to U.S. or third-country secured creditors, under certain narrowly-defined circumstances, for pre-embargo import and export transactions; (2) for legal representation or advice to the Government of the FRY (S/M) or FRY (S/M)-located or controlled entities; (3) for the liquidation or protection of tangible assets of subsidiaries of FRY (S/M)-located or controlled firms located in the U.S.; (4) for limited transactions related to FRY (S/M) diplomatic representation in Washington and New York; (5) for patent, trademark and copyright protection in the FRY (S/M) not involving payment to the FRY (S/M) Government; (6) for certain communications, news media, and travel- relateed transactions; (7) for the payment of crews' wages, vessel maintenance, and emergency supplies for FRY (S/M) controlled ships blocked in the United States; (8) for the removal from the FRY (S/M), or protection within the FRY (S/M), of certain property owned and controlled by U.S. entities; (9) to assist the United Nations in its relief operations and the activities of the U.N. Protection Force; and (10) for payment from funds outside the United States where a third country has licensed the transaction in accordance with U.N. sanctions. Pursuant to U.S. regulations implementing UNSC Resolutions, specific licenses have also been issued to authorize exportation of food, medicine, and supplies intended for humanitarian purposes in the FRY (S/M). During the past 6 months, FAC has continued to oversee the liquidation of tangible assets of the 15 U.S. subsidiaries of entities organized in the FRY (S/M). Subsequent to the issuance of Executive Order No. 12846, all operating licenses issued for these U.S.-located Serbian or Montenegrin subsidiaries or joint ventures were revoked, and the net proceeds of the liquidation of their assets placed in blocked accounts. In order to reduce the drain on blocked assets caused by continuing to rent commercial space, FAC arranged to have the blocked personalty, files, and records of the two Serbian banking institutions in New York moved to secure storage. The personalty is being liquidated, with the net proceeds placed in blocked accounts. Following the sale of the M/V Kapetan Martinovic in January 1995, five Yugoslav-owned vessels remain blocked in the United States. Approval of the UNSC's Serbian Sanctions Committee was sought and obtained for the sale of the M/V Kapetan Martinovic (and the M/V Bor, which was sold in June 1994) based on U.S. assurances that the sale would comply with four basic conditions, which assure that both U.S. and U.N. sanctions objectives with respect to the FRY (S/M) are met: (1) the sale will be for fair market value; (2) the sale will result in a complete divestiture of any interest of the FRY (S/M) (or of commercial interests located in or controlled from the FRY (S/M)) in the vessel; (3) the sale would result in no economic benefit to the FRY (S/M) (or commercial interests located in or controlled from the FRY (S/M)); and (4) the net proceeds of the sale (the gross proceeds less the costs of sale normally paid by the seller) will be placed in a blocked account in the United States. Negotiations for the sale of the M/V Bar, now blocked in New Orleans, are underway and are likely to be concluded prior to my next report. Other than the M/V Bar, the four remaining Yugoslav-owned vessels are beneficially owned by Jugooceanija Plovidba of Kotor, Montenegro, and managed by Milena Ship Management Co. Ltd. in Malta. These vessels have many unpaid U.S. creditors for services [[Page H 7102]] and supplies furnished during the time they have been blocked in the United States; moreover, the owner appears to have insufficient resources to provide for the future upkeep and maintenance needs of these vessels and their crews. The United States is notifying the UNSC's Serbian Sanctions Committee of the United States's intention to license some or all of these remaining four vessels upon the owner's request. With the FAC-licensed sales of the M/V Kapetan Martinovic and the M/V Bor, those vessels were removed from the list of blocked FRY entities and merchant vessels maintained by FAC. The new owners of several formerly Yugoslav-owned vessels, which have been sold in other countries, have petitioned FAC to remove those vessels from the list. FAC, in coordination with the Department of State, is currently reviewing the sale terms and conditions for those vessels to ascertain whether they comply with U.N. sanctions objectives and UNSC's Serbian Sanctions Committee practice. During the past 6 months, U.S. financial institutions have continued to block funds transfers in which there is an interest of the Government of the FRY (S/M) or an entity or undertaking located in or controlled from the FRY (S/M), and to stop prohibited transfers to persons in the FRY (S/M). Such interdicted transfers have accounted for $125.6 million since the issuance of Executive order No. 12808, including some $9.3 million during the past 6 months. To ensure compliance with the terms of the licenses that have been issued under the program, stringent reporting requirements are imposed. More than 279 submissions have been reviewed by FAC since the last report, and more than 125 compliance cases are currently open. 6. Since the issuance of Executive Order No. 12810, FAC has worked closely with the U.S. Customs Service to ensure both that prohibited imports and exports (including those in which the Government of the FRY (S/M) or Bosnian Serb authorities have an interest) are identified and interdicted, and that permitted imports and exports move to their intended destination without undue delay. Violations and suspected violations of the embargo are being investigated and appropriate enforcement actions are being taken. There are currently 37 cases under active investigation. Since the last report, FAC has collected nine civil penalties totaling nearly $20,000. Of these, five were paid by U.S. financial institutions for violative funds transfers involving the Government of the FRY (S/M), persons in the FRY (S/M), or entities located or organized in or controlled from the FRY (S/M). Three U.S. companies and one air carrier have also paid penalties related to exports or unlicensed payments to the Government of the FRY (S/M) or persons in the FRY (S/M) or other violations of the Regulations. 7. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month period from November 30, 1994, through May 29, 1995, that are directly attributable to the authorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency with respect to the FRY (S/M) and the Bosnian Serb forces and authorities are estimated at about $3.5 million, most of which represent wage and salary costs for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in the Department of the Treasury (particularly in FAC and its Chief Counsel's Office, and the U.S. Customs Service), the Department of State, the National Security Council, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Department of Commerce. 8. The actions and policies of the Government of the FRY (S/M), in its involvement in and support for groups attempting to seize and hold territory in the Republics of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina by force and violence, and the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina under their control, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The United States remains committed to a multilateral resolution of the conflict through implementation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions. I shall continue to exercise the powers at my disposal to apply economic sanctions against the FRY (S/M) and the Bosnian Serb forces, civil authorities, and entities, as long as these measures are appropriate, and will continue to report periodically to the Congress on significant developments pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).

DOC. 104-101) The Speaker pro tempore laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States, which was read and, together with the accompanying papers, without objection, referred to the Committee on International Relations and ordered to be printed. To the Congress of the United States: On May 30, 1992, in Executive Order No. 12808, the President declared a national emergency to deal with the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States arising from actions and policies of the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro, acting under the name of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, in their involvement in and support for groups attempting to seize territory in Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina by force and violence utilizing, in part, the forces of the so-called Yugoslav National Army (57 FR 23299, June 2, 1992). I expanded the national emergency in Executive Order No. 12934 of October 25, 1994, to address the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control. The present report is submitted pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1641(c) and 1703(c). It discusses Administration actions and expenses directly related to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order No. 12808 and Executive Order No. 12934 and to expanded sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) (the ``FRY (S/M)'') and the Bosnian Serbs contained in Executive Order No. 12810 of June 5, 1992 (57 FR 24347, June 9, 1992), Executive Order No. 12831 of January 15, 1993 (58 FR 5253, Jan. 21, 1993), Executive Order No. 12846 of April 25, 1993 (58 FR 25771, April 27, 1993), and Executive Order No. 12934 of October 25, 1994 (59 FR 54117, October 27, 1994). 1. Executive Order No. 12808 blocked all property and interests in property of the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro, or held in the name of the former Government of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, then or thereafter located in the United States or within the possession or control of U.S. persons, including their overseas branches. Subsequently, Executive Order No. 12810 expanded U.S. actions to implement in the United States the United Nations sanctions against the FRY (S/M) adopted in United Nations Security Council (``UNSC'') Resolution 757 of May 30, 1992. In addition to reaffirming the blocking of FRY (S/M) Government property, this order prohibited transactions with respect to the FRY (S/M) involving imports, exports, dealing in FRY-origin property, air and sea transportation, contract performance, funds transfers, activity promoting importation or exportation or dealings in property, and official sports, scientific, technical, or other cultural representation of, or sponsorship by, the FRY (S/M) in the United States. Executive Order No. 12810 exempted from trade restrictions (1) transshipments through the FRY (S/M), and (2) activities related to the United Nations Protection Force (``UNPROFOR''), the Conference on Yugoslavia, or the European Community Monitor Mission. On January 15, 1993, President Bush issued Executive Order No. 12831 to implement new sanctions contained in U.N. Security Council Resolution 787 of November 16, 1992. The order revoked the exemption for transshipments through the FRY (S/M) contained in Executive Order No. 12810, prohibited transactions within the United States or by a U.S. person relating to FRY (S/M) vessels and vessels in which a majority or controlling interest is held by a person or entity in, or operating from, the FRY (S/M), and stated that all such vessels shall be considered as vessels of the FRY (S/M), regardless of the flag under which they sail. On April 25, 1993, I issued Executive Order No. 12846 to implement in the United States the sanctions adopted in UNSC Resolution 820 of April 17, 1993. That resolution called on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen peace plan for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and, if they failed to do so by April 26, called on member states to take additional measures to tighten the embargo against the FRY (S/M) and Serbian controlled areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the United Nations Protected Areas in Croatia. Effective April 26, 1993, the order blocked all property and interests in property of commercial, industrial, or public utility undertakings or entities organized or located in the FRY (S/M), including property and interests in property of entities (wherever organized or located) owned or controlled by such undertakings or entities, that are or thereafter come within the possession or control of U.S. persons. On October 25, 1994, in view of UNSC Resolution 942 of September 23, 1994, I issued Executive Order No. 12934 in order to take additional steps with respect to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. (59 FR 54117, October 27, 1994.) Executive Order No. 12934 expands the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12808 to address the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the territory in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control, including their refusal to accept the proposed territorial settlement of the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Executive order blocks all property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of United States persons (including their overseas branches) of: (1) the Bosnian Serb military and paramilitary forces and the authorities in areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of those forces; (2) any entity, including any commercial, industrial, or public utility undertaking, organized or located in those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces; (3) any entity, wherever organized or located, which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by any person in, or resident in, those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces; and (4) any person acting for or on behalf of any person within the scope of the above definitions. The Executive order also prohibits the provision or exportation of services to those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces, or to any person for the purpose of any business carried on in those areas, either from the United States or by a U.S. person. The order also prohibits the entry of any U.S.- flagged vessel, other than a U.S. naval vessel, into the riverine ports of those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnia Serb forces. Finally, any transaction by any U.S. person that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in the order is prohibited. Executive Order No. 12934 became effective at 11:59 p.m., e.d.t., on October 25, 1994. 2. The declaration of the national emergency on May 30, 1992, was made pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code. The emergency declaration was reported to the Congress on May 30, 1992, pursuant to section 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(b)) and the expansion of that National Emergency under the same authorities was reported to the Congress on October 25, 1994. The additional sanctions set forth in related Executive orders were imposed pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the statutes cited [[Page H 7101]] above, section 1114 of the Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C. App. 1514), and section 5 of the United Nations Participation Act (22 U.S.C. 287c). 3. There have been no amendments to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) Sanctions Regulations (the ``Regulations''), 31 C.F.R. Part 585, since the last report. The Treasury Department had previously published 853 names in the Federal Register on November 17, 1994 (59 FR 59460), as part of a comprehensive listing of all blocked persons and specially designated nationals (``SDNs'') of the FRY (S/M). This list identified individuals and entities determined by the Department of the Treasury to be owned or controlled by or acting for or on behalf of the Government of the FRY (S/M), persons in the FRY (S/M), or entities located or organized in or controlled from the FRY (S/M). All prohibitions in the Regulations pertaining to the Government of the FRY (S/M) apply to the entities and individuals identified. U.S. persons, on notice of the status of such blocked persons and specially designated nationals, are prohibited from entering into transactions with them, or transactions in which they have an interest, unless otherwise exempted or authorized pursuant to the Regulations. On February 22, 1995, pursuant to Executive Order 12934 and the Regulations, Treasury identified 85 individuals as leaders of the Bosnian Serb forces or civilian authorities in the territories in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control. Also on February 22, Treasury designated 19 individuals and 23 companies as SDNs of the FRY (S/M). These designations include FRY (S/M)-connected companies around the world that are being directed from Cyprus, two Cypriot-owned firms that have had a central role in helping establish and sustain sanctions-evading FRY (S/M) front companies in Cyprus, and the head of the FRY (S/M)'s Central Bank who is also the architect of the FRY (S/M) economic program. Additionally, on March 13, 1995, Treasury named 32 firms and eight individuals that are part of the Karic Brothers' family network of companies as SDNs of the FRY (S/M). Their enterprises span the globe and are especially active in former East Bloc countries. These additions and amendments, published in the Federal Register on April 18, 1995 (60 FR 19448), bring the current total of Blocked Entities and SDNs of the FRY (S/M) to 938 and the total number of individuals identified as leaders of the Bosnian Serb military or paramilitary forces or civilian authorities in the territories in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control to 85. A copy of the notice is attached. Treasury's blocking authority as applied to FRY (S/M) subsidiaries and vessels in the United States has been challenged in court. In Milena Ship Management Company, Ltd. v. Newcomb, 804 F.Supp. 846, 855, and 859 (E.D.L.A. 1992) aff'd, 995 F.2d 620 (5th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S.Ct. 877 (1994), involving five ships owned or controlled by FRY (S/M) entities blocked in various U.S. ports, the blocking authority as applied to these vessels was upheld. In IPT Company, Inc. v. United States Department of the Treasury, No. 92 CIV 5542 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), the district court also upheld the blocking authority as applied to the property of a Yugoslav subsidiary located in the United States. The latter case is currently on appeal to the Second Circuit. 4. Over the past 6 months, the Departments of State and Treasury have worked closely with European Union (the ``EU'') member states and other U.N. member nations to coordinate implementation of the U.N. sanctions against the FRY (S/M). This has included visits by assessment teams formed under the auspices of the United States, the EU, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (the ``OSCE'') to states bordering on Serbia and Montenegro; continued deployment of OSCE sanctions assistance missions (``SAMs'') to Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine to assist in monitoring land and Danube River traffic; support for the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia (``ICFY'') monitoring missions along the Serbia-Montenegro-Bosnia border; bilateral contacts between the United States and other countries for the purpose of tightening financial and trade restrictions on the FRY (S/M); and ongoing multilateral meetings by financial sanctions enforcement authorities from various countries to coordinate enforcement efforts and to exchange technical information. 5. In accordance with licensing policy and the Regulations, FAC has exercised its authority to license certain specific transactions with respect to the FRY (S/M) that are consistent with U.S. foreign policy and the Security Council sanctions. During the reporting period, FAC has issued 109 specific licenses regarding transactions pertaining to the FRY (S/M) or assets it owns or controls, bringing the total as of April 25, 1995, to 930. Specific licenses have been issued (1) for payment to U.S. or third-country secured creditors, under certain narrowly-defined circumstances, for pre-embargo import and export transactions; (2) for legal representation or advice to the Government of the FRY (S/M) or FRY (S/M)-located or controlled entities; (3) for the liquidation or protection of tangible assets of subsidiaries of FRY (S/M)-located or controlled firms located in the U.S.; (4) for limited transactions related to FRY (S/M) diplomatic representation in Washington and New York; (5) for patent, trademark and copyright protection in the FRY (S/M) not involving payment to the FRY (S/M) Government; (6) for certain communications, news media, and travel- relateed transactions; (7) for the payment of crews' wages, vessel maintenance, and emergency supplies for FRY (S/M) controlled ships blocked in the United States; (8) for the removal from the FRY (S/M), or protection within the FRY (S/M), of certain property owned and controlled by U.S. entities; (9) to assist the United Nations in its relief operations and the activities of the U.N. Protection Force; and (10) for payment from funds outside the United States where a third country has licensed the transaction in accordance with U.N. sanctions. Pursuant to U.S. regulations implementing UNSC Resolutions, specific licenses have also been issued to authorize exportation of food, medicine, and supplies intended for humanitarian purposes in the FRY (S/M). During the past 6 months, FAC has continued to oversee the liquidation of tangible assets of the 15 U.S. subsidiaries of entities organized in the FRY (S/M). Subsequent to the issuance of Executive Order No. 12846, all operating licenses issued for these U.S.-located Serbian or Montenegrin subsidiaries or joint ventures were revoked, and the net proceeds of the liquidation of their assets placed in blocked accounts. In order to reduce the drain on blocked assets caused by continuing to rent commercial space, FAC arranged to have the blocked personalty, files, and records of the two Serbian banking institutions in New York moved to secure storage. The personalty is being liquidated, with the net proceeds placed in blocked accounts. Following the sale of the M/V Kapetan Martinovic in January 1995, five Yugoslav-owned vessels remain blocked in the United States. Approval of the UNSC's Serbian Sanctions Committee was sought and obtained for the sale of the M/V Kapetan Martinovic (and the M/V Bor, which was sold in June 1994) based on U.S. assurances that the sale would comply with four basic conditions, which assure that both U.S. and U.N. sanctions objectives with respect to the FRY (S/M) are met: (1) the sale will be for fair market value; (2) the sale will result in a complete divestiture of any interest of the FRY (S/M) (or of commercial interests located in or controlled from the FRY (S/M)) in the vessel; (3) the sale would result in no economic benefit to the FRY (S/M) (or commercial interests located in or controlled from the FRY (S/M)); and (4) the net proceeds of the sale (the gross proceeds less the costs of sale normally paid by the seller) will be placed in a blocked account in the United States. Negotiations for the sale of the M/V Bar, now blocked in New Orleans, are underway and are likely to be concluded prior to my next report. Other than the M/V Bar, the four remaining Yugoslav-owned vessels are beneficially owned by Jugooceanija Plovidba of Kotor, Montenegro, and managed by Milena Ship Management Co. Ltd. in Malta. These vessels have many unpaid U.S. creditors for services [[Page H 7102]] and supplies furnished during the time they have been blocked in the United States; moreover, the owner appears to have insufficient resources to provide for the future upkeep and maintenance needs of these vessels and their crews. The United States is notifying the UNSC's Serbian Sanctions Committee of the United States's intention to license some or all of these remaining four vessels upon the owner's request. With the FAC-licensed sales of the M/V Kapetan Martinovic and the M/V Bor, those vessels were removed from the list of blocked FRY entities and merchant vessels maintained by FAC. The new owners of several formerly Yugoslav-owned vessels, which have been sold in other countries, have petitioned FAC to remove those vessels from the list. FAC, in coordination with the Department of State, is currently reviewing the sale terms and conditions for those vessels to ascertain whether they comply with U.N. sanctions objectives and UNSC's Serbian Sanctions Committee practice. During the past 6 months, U.S. financial institutions have continued to block funds transfers in which there is an interest of the Government of the FRY (S/M) or an entity or undertaking located in or controlled from the FRY (S/M), and to stop prohibited transfers to persons in the FRY (S/M). Such interdicted transfers have accounted for $125.6 million since the issuance of Executive order No. 12808, including some $9.3 million during the past 6 months. To ensure compliance with the terms of the licenses that have been issued under the program, stringent reporting requirements are imposed. More than 279 submissions have been reviewed by FAC since the last report, and more than 125 compliance cases are currently open. 6. Since the issuance of Executive Order No. 12810, FAC has worked closely with the U.S. Customs Service to ensure both that prohibited imports and exports (including those in which the Government of the FRY (S/M) or Bosnian Serb authorities have an interest) are identified and interdicted, and that permitted imports and exports move to their intended destination without undue delay. Violations and suspected violations of the embargo are being investigated and appropriate enforcement actions are being taken. There are currently 37 cases under active investigation. Since the last report, FAC has collected nine civil penalties totaling nearly $20,000. Of these, five were paid by U.S. financial institutions for violative funds transfers involving the Government of the FRY (S/M), persons in the FRY (S/M), or entities located or organized in or controlled from the FRY (S/M). Three U.S. companies and one air carrier have also paid penalties related to exports or unlicensed payments to the Government of the FRY (S/M) or persons in the FRY (S/M) or other violations of the Regulations. 7. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month period from November 30, 1994, through May 29, 1995, that are directly attributable to the authorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency with respect to the FRY (S/M) and the Bosnian Serb forces and authorities are estimated at about $3.5 million, most of which represent wage and salary costs for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in the Department of the Treasury (particularly in FAC and its Chief Counsel's Office, and the U.S. Customs Service), the Department of State, the National Security Council, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Department of Commerce. 8. The actions and policies of the Government of the FRY (S/M), in its involvement in and support for groups attempting to seize and hold territory in the Republics of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina by force and violence, and the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina under their control, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The United States remains committed to a multilateral resolution of the conflict through implementation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions. I shall continue to exercise the powers at my disposal to apply economic sanctions against the FRY (S/M) and the Bosnian Serb forces, civil authorities, and entities, as long as these measures are appropriate, and will continue to report periodically to the Congress on significant developments pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).

DOC. 104-101) The Speaker pro tempore laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States, which was read and, together with the accompanying papers, without objection, referred to the Committee on International Relations and ordered to be printed. To the Congress of the United States: On May 30, 1992, in Executive Order No. 12808, the President declared a national emergency to deal with the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States arising from actions and policies of the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro, acting under the name of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, in their involvement in and support for groups attempting to seize territory in Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina by force and violence utilizing, in part, the forces of the so-called Yugoslav National Army (57 FR 23299, June 2, 1992). I expanded the national emergency in Executive Order No. 12934 of October 25, 1994, to address the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control. The present report is submitted pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1641(c) and 1703(c). It discusses Administration actions and expenses directly related to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order No. 12808 and Executive Order No. 12934 and to expanded sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) (the ``FRY (S/M)'') and the Bosnian Serbs contained in Executive Order No. 12810 of June 5, 1992 (57 FR 24347, June 9, 1992), Executive Order No. 12831 of January 15, 1993 (58 FR 5253, Jan. 21, 1993), Executive Order No. 12846 of April 25, 1993 (58 FR 25771, April 27, 1993), and Executive Order No. 12934 of October 25, 1994 (59 FR 54117, October 27, 1994). 1. Executive Order No. 12808 blocked all property and interests in property of the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro, or held in the name of the former Government of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, then or thereafter located in the United States or within the possession or control of U.S. persons, including their overseas branches. Subsequently, Executive Order No. 12810 expanded U.S. actions to implement in the United States the United Nations sanctions against the FRY (S/M) adopted in United Nations Security Council (``"", ""UNSC'"", ""') Resolution 757 of May 30, 1992. In addition to reaffirming the blocking of FRY (S/M) Government property, this order prohibited transactions with respect to the FRY (S/M) involving imports, exports, dealing in FRY-origin property, air and sea transportation, contract performance, funds transfers, activity promoting importation or exportation or dealings in property, and official sports, scientific, technical, or other cultural representation of, or sponsorship by, the FRY (S/M) in the United States. Executive Order No. 12810 exempted from trade restrictions (1) transshipments through the FRY (S/M), and (2) activities related to the United Nations Protection Force (``"", ""UNPROFOR'"", ""'), the Conference on Yugoslavia, or the European Community Monitor Mission. On January 15, 1993, President Bush issued Executive Order No. 12831 to implement new sanctions contained in U.N. Security Council Resolution 787 of November 16, 1992. The order revoked the exemption for transshipments through the FRY (S/M) contained in Executive Order No. 12810, prohibited transactions within the United States or by a U.S. person relating to FRY (S/M) vessels and vessels in which a majority or controlling interest is held by a person or entity in, or operating from, the FRY (S/M), and stated that all such vessels shall be considered as vessels of the FRY (S/M), regardless of the flag under which they sail. On April 25, 1993, I issued Executive Order No. 12846 to implement in the United States the sanctions adopted in "", 'UNSC ', 'Resolution 820 of April 17, 1993. That resolution called on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen peace plan for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and, if they failed to do so by April 26, called on member states to take additional measures to tighten the embargo against the FRY (S/M) and Serbian controlled areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the United Nations Protected Areas in Croatia. Effective April 26, 1993, the order blocked all property and interests in property of commercial, industrial, or public utility undertakings or entities organized or located in the FRY (S/M), including property and interests in property of entities (wherever organized or located) owned or controlled by such undertakings or entities, that are or thereafter come within the possession or control of U.S. persons. On October 25, 1994, in view of ', 'UNSC ', 'Resolution 942 of September 23, 1994, I issued Executive Order No. 12934 in order to take additional steps with respect to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. (59 FR 54117, October 27, 1994.) Executive Order No. 12934 expands the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12808 to address the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the territory in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control, including their refusal to accept the proposed territorial settlement of the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Executive order blocks all property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of United States persons (including their overseas branches) of: (1) the Bosnian Serb military and paramilitary forces and the authorities in areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of those forces; (2) any entity, including any commercial, industrial, or public utility undertaking, organized or located in those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces; (3) any entity, wherever organized or located, which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by any person in, or resident in, those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces; and (4) any person acting for or on behalf of any person within the scope of the above definitions. The Executive order also prohibits the provision or exportation of services to those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces, or to any person for the purpose of any business carried on in those areas, either from the United States or by a U.S. person. The order also prohibits the entry of any U.S.- flagged vessel, other than a U.S. naval vessel, into the riverine ports of those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnia Serb forces. Finally, any transaction by any U.S. person that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in the order is prohibited. Executive Order No. 12934 became effective at 11:59 p.m., e.d.t., on October 25, 1994. 2. The declaration of the national emergency on May 30, 1992, was made pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code. The emergency declaration was reported to the Congress on May 30, 1992, pursuant to section 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(b)) and the expansion of that National Emergency under the same authorities was reported to the Congress on October 25, 1994. The additional sanctions set forth in related Executive orders were imposed pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the statutes cited [[', 'Page H ', ""7101]] above, section 1114 of the Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C. App. 1514), and section 5 of the United Nations Participation Act (22 U.S.C. 287c). 3. There have been no amendments to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) Sanctions Regulations (the ``Regulations''), 31 C.F.R. Part 585, since the last report. The Treasury Department had previously published 853 names in the Federal Register on November 17, 1994 (59 FR 59460), as part of a comprehensive listing of all blocked persons and specially designated nationals (``SDNs'') of the FRY (S/M). This list identified individuals and entities determined by the Department of the Treasury to be owned or controlled by or acting for or on behalf of the Government of the FRY (S/M), persons in the FRY (S/M), or entities located or organized in or controlled from the FRY (S/M). All prohibitions in the Regulations pertaining to the Government of the FRY (S/M) apply to the entities and individuals identified. U.S. persons, on notice of the status of such blocked persons and specially designated nationals, are prohibited from entering into transactions with them, or transactions in which they have an interest, unless otherwise exempted or authorized pursuant to the Regulations. On February 22, 1995, pursuant to Executive Order 12934 and the Regulations, Treasury identified 85 individuals as leaders of the Bosnian Serb forces or civilian authorities in the territories in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control. Also on February 22, Treasury designated 19 individuals and 23 companies as SDNs of the FRY (S/M). These designations include FRY (S/M)-connected companies around the world that are being directed from Cyprus, two Cypriot-owned firms that have had a central role in helping establish and sustain sanctions-evading FRY (S/M) front companies in Cyprus, and the head of the FRY (S/M)'s Central Bank who is also the architect of the FRY (S/M) economic program. Additionally, on March 13, 1995, Treasury named 32 firms and eight individuals that are part of the Karic Brothers' family network of companies as SDNs of the FRY (S/M). Their enterprises span the globe and are especially active in former East Bloc countries. These additions and amendments, published in the Federal Register on April 18, 1995 (60 FR 19448), bring the current total of Blocked Entities and SDNs of the FRY (S/M) to 938 and the total number of individuals identified as leaders of the Bosnian Serb military or paramilitary forces or civilian authorities in the territories in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control to 85. A copy of the notice is attached. Treasury's blocking authority as applied to FRY (S/M) subsidiaries and vessels in the United States has been challenged in court. In Milena Ship Management Company, Ltd. v. Newcomb, 804 F.Supp. 846, 855, and 859 (E.D.L.A. 1992) aff'd, 995 F.2d 620 (5th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S.Ct. 877 (1994), involving five ships owned or controlled by FRY (S/M) entities blocked in various U.S. ports, the blocking authority as applied to these vessels was upheld. "", 'In IPT ', ""Company, Inc. v. United States Department of the Treasury, No. 92 CIV 5542 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), the district court also upheld the blocking authority as applied to the property of a Yugoslav subsidiary located in the United States. The latter case is currently on appeal to the Second Circuit. 4. Over the past 6 months, the Departments of State and Treasury have worked closely with European Union (the ``EU'') member states and other U.N. member nations to coordinate implementation of the U.N. sanctions against the FRY (S/M). This has included visits by assessment teams formed under the auspices of the United States, the EU, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (the ``"", ""OSCE'"", ""') to states bordering on Serbia and Montenegro; continued deployment of "", 'OSCE ', ""sanctions assistance missions (``SAMs'') to Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine to assist in monitoring land and Danube River traffic; support for the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia (``"", ""ICFY'"", ""') monitoring missions along the Serbia-Montenegro-Bosnia border; bilateral contacts between the United States and other countries for the purpose of tightening financial and trade restrictions on the FRY (S/M); and ongoing multilateral meetings by financial sanctions enforcement authorities from various countries to coordinate enforcement efforts and to exchange technical information. 5. In accordance with licensing policy and the "", 'Regulations, FAC ', ""has exercised its authority to license certain specific transactions with respect to the FRY (S/M) that are consistent with U.S. foreign policy and the Security Council sanctions.

Protection Force; and (10) for payment from funds outside the United States where a third country has licensed the transaction in accordance with U.N. sanctions. Pursuant to U.S. regulations implementing "", 'UNSC ', 'Resolutions, specific licenses have also been issued to authorize exportation of food, medicine, and supplies intended for humanitarian purposes in the FRY (S/M). During the past 6 months, FAC has continued to oversee the liquidation of tangible assets of the 15 U.S. subsidiaries of entities organized in the FRY (S/M).

6,"REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 67 THE PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message from the President of the United States, together with an accompanying report; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. To the Congress of the United States: On May 30, 1992, in Executive Order No. 12808, the President declared a national emergency to deal with the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States arising from actions and policies of the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro, acting under the name of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, in their involvement in and support for groups attempting to seize territory in Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina by force and violence utilizing, in part, the forces of the so-called Yugoslav National Army (57 FR 23299, June 2, 1992). I expanded the national emergency in Executive Order No. 12934 of October 25, 1994, to address the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control. The present report is submitted pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1641(c) and 1703(c). It discusses Administration actions and expenses directly related to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order No. 12808 and Executive Order No. 12934 and to expanded sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) (the ``FRY (S/M)'') and the Bosnian Serbs contained in Executive Order No. 12810 of June 5, 1992 (57 FR 24347, June 9, 1992), Executive Order No. 12831 of January 15, 1993 (58 FR 5253, Jan. 21, 1993), Executive Order No. 12846 of April 25, 1993 (58 FR 25771, April 27, 1993), and Executive Order No. 12934 of October 25, 1994 (59 FR 54117, October 27, 1994). 1. Executive Order No. 12808 blocked all property and interests in property of the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro, or held in the name of the former Government of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, then or thereafter located in the United States or within the possession or control of U.S. persons, including their overseas branches. Subsequently, Executive Order No. 12810 expanded U.S. actions to implement in the United States the United Nations sanctions against the FRY (S/M) adopted in United Nations Security Council (``UNSC'') Resolution 757 of May 30, 1992. In addition to reaffirming the blocking of FRY (S/M) Government property, this order prohibited transactions with respect to the FRY (S/M) involving imports, exports, dealing in FRY-origin property, air and sea transportation, contract performance, funds transfers, activity promoting importation or exportation or dealings in property, and official sports, scientific, technical, or other cultural representation of, or sponsorship by, the FRY (S/M) in the United States. Executive Order No. 12810 exempted from trade restrictions (1) transshipments through the FRY (S/M), and (2) activities related to the United Nations Protection Force (``UNPROFOR''), the Conference on Yugoslavia, or the European Community Monitor Mission. On January 15, 1993, President Bush issued Executive Order No. 12831 to implement new sanctions contained in U.N. Security Council Resolution 787 of November 16, 1992. The order revoked the exemption for transshipments through the FRY (S/M) contained in Executive Order No. 12810, prohibited transactions within the United States or by a U.S. person relating to FRY (S/M) vessels and vessels in which a majority or controlling interest is held by a person or entity in, or operating from, the FRY (S/M), and stated that all such vessels shall be considered as vessels of the FRY (S/M), regardless of the flag under which they sail. On April 25, 1993, I issued Executive Order No. 12846 to implement in the United States the sanctions adopted in UNSC Resolution 820 of April 17, 1993. That resolution called on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen peace plan for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and, if they failed to do so by April 26, called on member states to take additional measures to tighten the embargo against the FRY (S/M) and Serbian controlled areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the United Nations Protected Areas in Croatia. Effective April 26, 1993, the order blocked all property and interests in property of commercial, industrial, or public utility undertakings or entities organized or located in the FRY (S/M), including property and interests in property of entities (wherever organized or located) owned or controlled by such undertakings or entities, that are or thereafter come within the possession or control of U.S. persons. On October 25, 1994, in view of UNSC Resolution 942 of September 23, 1994, I issued Executive Order No. 12934 in order to take additional steps with respect to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. (59 FR 54117, October 27, 1994.) Executive Order No. 12934 expands the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12808 to address the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the territory in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control, including their refusal to accept the proposed territorial settlement of the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Executive order blocks all property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of United States persons (including their overseas branches) of: (1) the Bosnian Serb military and paramilitary forces and the authorities in areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of those forces; (2) any entity, including any commercial, industrial, or public utility undertaking, organized or located in those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces; (3) any entity, wherever organized or located, which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by any person in, or resident in, those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces; and (4) any person acting for or on behalf of any person within the scope of the above definitions. The Executive order also prohibits the provision or exportation of services to those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces, or to any person for the purpose of any business carried on in those areas, either from the United States or by a U.S. person. The order also prohibits the entry of any U.S.- flagged vessel, other than a U.S. naval vessel, into the riverine ports of those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnia Serb forces. Finally, any transaction by any U.S. person that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in the order is prohibited. Executive Order No. 12934 became effective at 11:59 p.m., e.d.t., on October 25, 1994. 2. The declaration of the national emergency on May 30, 1992, was made pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code. The emergency [[Page S 10240]] declaration was reported to the Congress on May 30, 1992, pursuant to section 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(b)) and the expansion of that National Emergency under the same authorities was reported to the Congress on October 25, 1994. The additional sanctions set forth in related Executive orders were imposed pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the statutes cited above, section 1114 of the Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C. App. 1514), and section 5 of the United Nations Participation Act (22 U.S.C. 287c). 3. There have been no amendments to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) Sanctions Regulations (the ``Regulations''), 31 C.F.R. Part 585, since the last report. The Treasury Department had previously published 853 names in the Federal Register on November 17, 1994 (59 FR 59460), as part of a comprehensive listing of all blocked persons and specially designated nationals (``SDNs'') of the FRY (S/M). This list identified individuals and entities determined by the Department of the Treasury to be owned or controlled by or acting for or on behalf of the Government of the FRY (S/M), persons in the FRY (S/M), or entities located or organized in or controlled from the FRY (S/M). All prohibitions in the Regulations pertaining to the Government of the FRY (S/M) apply to the entities and individuals identified. U.S. persons, on notice of the status of such blocked persons and specially designated nationals, are prohibited from entering into transactions with them, or transactions in which they have an interest, unless otherwise exempted or authorized pursuant to the Regulations. On February 22, 1995, pursuant to Executive Order 12934 and the Regulations, Treasury identified 85 individuals as leaders of the Bosnian Serb forces or civilian authorities in the territories in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control. Also on February 22, Treasury designated 19 individuals and 23 companies as SDNs of the FRY (S/M). These designations include FRY (S/M)-connected companies around the world that are being directed from Cyprus, two Cypriot-owned firms that have had a central role in helping establish and sustain sanctions-evading FRY (S/M) front companies in Cyprus, and the head of the FRY (S/M)'s Central Bank who is also the architect of the FRY (S/M) economic program. Additionally, on March 13, 1995, Treasury named 32 firms and eight individuals that are part of the Karic Brothers' family network of companies as SDNs of the FRY (S/M). Their enterprises span the globe and are especially active in former East Bloc countries. These additions and amendments, published in the Federal Register on April 18, 1995 (60 FR 19448), bring the current total of Blocked Entities and SDNs of the FRY (S/M) to 938 and the total number of individuals identified as leaders of the Bosnian Serb military or paramilitary forces or civilian authorities in the territories in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control to 85. A copy of the notice is attached. Treasury's blocking authority as applied to FRY (S/M) subsidiaries and vessels in the United States has been challenged in court. In Milena Ship Management Company, Ltd. v. Newcomb, 804 F Supp. 846, 855, and 859 (E.D.L.A. 1992) aff'd, 995 F.2d 620 (5th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S.Ct. 877 (1994), involving five ships owned or controlled by FRY (S/M) entities blocked in various U.S. ports, the blocking authority as applied to these vessels was upheld. In IPT Company, Inc. v. United States Department of the Treasury, No. 92 CIV 5542 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), the district court also upheld the blocking authority as applied to the property of a Yugoslav subsidiary located in the United States. The latter case is currently on appeal to the Second Circuit. 4. Over the past 6 months, the Departments of State and Treasury have worked closely with European Union (the ``EU'') member states and other U.N. member nations to coordinate implementation of the U.N. sanctions against the FRY (S/M). This has included visits by assessment teams formed under the auspices of the United States, the EU, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (the ``OSCE'') to states bordering on Serbia and Montenegro; continued deployment of OSCE sanctions assistance missions (``SAMs'') to Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine to assist in monitoring land and Danube River traffic; support for the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia (``ICFY'') monitoring missions along the Serbia-Montenegro-Bosnia border; bilateral contacts between the United States and other countries for the purpose of tightening financial and trade restrictions on the FRY (S/M); and ongoing multilateral meetings by financial sanctions enforcement authorities from various countries to coordinate enforcement efforts and to exchange technical information. 5. In accordance with licensing policy and the Regulations, FAC has exercised its authority to license certain specific transactions with respect to the FRY (S/M) that are consistent with U.S. foreign policy and the Security Council sanctions. During the reporting period, FAC has issued 109 specific licenses regarding transactions pertaining to the FRY (S/M) or assets it owns or controls, bringing the total as of April 25, 1995, to 930. Specific licenses have been issued (1) for payment to U.S. or third-country secured creditors, under certain narrowly-defined circumstances, for pre-embargo import and export transactions; (2) for legal representation or advice to the Government of the FRY (S/M) or FRY (S/M)--located or controlled entities; (3) for the liquidation or protection of tangible assets of subsidiaries of FRY (S/M)--located or controlled firms located in the U.S.; (4) for limited transactions related to FRY (S/M) diplomatic representation in Washington and New York; (S) for patent, trademark and copyright protection in the FRY (S/M) not involving payment to the FRY (S/M) Government; (6) for certain communications, news media, and travel- related transactions; (7) for the payment of crews' wages, vessel maintenance, and emergency supplies for FRY (S/M) controlled ships blocked in the United States; (8) for the removal from the FRY (S/M), or protection within the FRY (S/M), of certain property owned and controlled by U.S. entities; (9) to assist the United Nations in its relief operations and the activities of the U.N. Protection Force; and (10) for payment from funds outside the United States where a third country has licensed the transaction in accordance with U.N. sanctions. Pursuant to U.S. regulations implementing UNSC Resolutions, specific licenses have also been issued to authorize exportation of food, medicine, and supplies intended for humanitarian purposes in the FRY (S/M). During the past 6 months, FAC has continued to oversee the liquidation of tangible assets of the 15 U.S. subsidiaries of entities organized in the FRY (S/M). Subsequent to the issuance of Executive Order No. 12846, all operating licenses issued for these U.S.-located Serbian or Montenegrin subsidiaries or joint ventures were revoked, and the net proceeds of the liquidation of their assets placed in blocked accounts. In order to reduce the drain on blocked assets caused by continuing to rent commercial space, FAC arranged to have the blocked personality, files, and records of the two Serbian banking institutions in New York moved to secure storage. The personality is being liquidated, with the net proceeds placed in blocked accounts. Following the sale of the M/V Kapetan Martinovic in January 1995, five Yugoslav-owned vessels remain blocked in the United States. Approval of the UNSC's Serbian sanctions Committee was sought and obtained for the sale of the M/V Kapetan Martinovic (and the M/V Bor, which was sold in June 1994) based on U.S. assurances that the sale would comply with four basic conditions, which assure that both U.S. and U.N. sanctions objectives with respect to the FRY (S/M) are met: (1) the sale will be for fair market value; (2) the sale will result in a complete divestiture of any interest of the FRY (S/M) (or of commercial interests located in or controlled from the FRY (S/M) in the vessel; (3) the sale would result in no economic benefit to the FRY (S/ M) (or commercial interests located in or controlled from the FRY (S/ M)); and (4) the net proceeds of the sale (the gross proceeds less the costs of sale normally paid by the seller) will [[Page S 10241]] be placed in a blocked account in the United States. Negotiations for the sale of the M/V Bar, now blocked in New Orleans, are underway and are likely to be concluded prior to my next report. Other than the M/V Bar, the four remaining Yugoslav-owned vessels are beneficially owned by Jugooceanija, Plovidba of Kotor, Montenegro, and managed by Milena Ship Management Co. Ltd. in Malta. These vessels have many unpaid U.S. creditors for services and supplies furnished during the time they have been blocked in the United States; moreover, the owner appears to have insufficient resources to provide for the future upkeep and maintenance needs of these vessels and their crews. The United States is notifying the UNSC's Serbian Sanctions Committee of the United States's intention to license some or all of these remaining four vessels upon the owner's request. With the FAC-licensed sales of the M/V Kapetan Martinovic and the M/V Bor, those vessels were removed from the list of blocked FRY entities and merchant vessels maintained by FAC. The new owners of several formerly Yugoslav-owned vessels, which have been sold in other countries, have petitioned FAC to remove those vessels from the list. FAC, in coordination with the Department of State, is currently reviewing the sale terms and conditions for those vessels to ascertain whether they comply with U.N. sanctions objectives and UNSC's Serbian Sanctions Committee practice. During the past 6 months, U.S. financial institutions have continued to block funds transfers in which there is an interest of the Government of the FRY (S/M) or an entity or undertaking located in or controlled from the FRY (S/M), and to stop prohibited transfers to persons in the FRY (S/M). Such interdicted transfers have accounted for $125.6 million since the issuance of Executive Order No. 12808, including some $9.3 million during the past 6 months. To ensure compliance with the terms of the licenses that have been issued under the program, stringent reporting requirements are imposed. More than 279 submissions have been reviewed by FAC since the last report, and more than 125 compliance cases are currently open. 6. Since the issuance of Executive Order No. 12810, FAC has worked closely with the U.S. Customs Service to ensure both that prohibited imports and exports (including those in which the Government of the FRY (S/M) or Bosnian Serb authorities have an interest) are identified and interdicted, and that permitted imports and exports move to their intended destination without undue delay. Violations and suspected violations of the embargo are being investigated and appropriate enforcement actions are being taken. There are currently 37 cases under active investigation. Since the last report, FAC has collected nine civil penalties totaling nearly $20,000. Of these, five were paid by U.S. financial institutions for violative funds transfers involving the Government of the FRY (S/M), persons in the FRY (S/M), or entities located or organized in or controlled from the FRY (S/M). Three U.S. companies and one air carrier have also paid penalties related to exports or unlicensed payments to the Government of the FRY (S/M) or persons in the FRY (S/M) or other violations of the Regulations. 7. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month period from November 30, 1994, through May 29, 1995, that are directly attributable to the authorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency with respect to the FRY (S/M) and the Bosnian Serb forces and authorities are estimated at about $3.5 million, most of which represent wage and salary costs for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in the Department of the Treasury (particularly in FAC and its Chief Counsel's Office, and the U.S. Customs Service), the Department of State, the National Security Council, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Department of Commerce. 8. The actions and policies of the Government of the FRY (S/M), in its involvement in and support for groups attempting to seize and hold territory in the Republics of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina by force and violence, and the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina under their control, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The United States remains committed to a multilateral resolution of the conflict through implementation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions. I shall continue to exercise the powers at my disposal to apply economic sanctions against the FRY (S/M) and the Bosnian Serb forces, civil authorities, and entities, as long as these measures are appropriate, and will continue to report periodically to the Congress on significant developments pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c). William J. Clinton. The White House, July 18, 1995.

To the Congress of the United States: On May 30, 1992, in Executive Order No. 12808, the President declared a national emergency to deal with the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States arising from actions and policies of the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro, acting under the name of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, in their involvement in and support for groups attempting to seize territory in Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina by force and violence utilizing, in part, the forces of the so-called Yugoslav National Army (57 FR 23299, June 2, 1992). I expanded the national emergency in Executive Order No. 12934 of October 25, 1994, to address the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control. The present report is submitted pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1641(c) and 1703(c). It discusses Administration actions and expenses directly related to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order No. 12808 and Executive Order No. 12934 and to expanded sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) (the ``FRY (S/M)'') and the Bosnian Serbs contained in Executive Order No. 12810 of June 5, 1992 (57 FR 24347, June 9, 1992), Executive Order No. 12831 of January 15, 1993 (58 FR 5253, Jan. 21, 1993), Executive Order No. 12846 of April 25, 1993 (58 FR 25771, April 27, 1993), and Executive Order No. 12934 of October 25, 1994 (59 FR 54117, October 27, 1994). 1. Executive Order No. 12808 blocked all property and interests in property of the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro, or held in the name of the former Government of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, then or thereafter located in the United States or within the possession or control of U.S. persons, including their overseas branches. Subsequently, Executive Order No. 12810 expanded U.S. actions to implement in the United States the United Nations sanctions against the FRY (S/M) adopted in United Nations Security Council (``UNSC'') Resolution 757 of May 30, 1992. In addition to reaffirming the blocking of FRY (S/M) Government property, this order prohibited transactions with respect to the FRY (S/M) involving imports, exports, dealing in FRY-origin property, air and sea transportation, contract performance, funds transfers, activity promoting importation or exportation or dealings in property, and official sports, scientific, technical, or other cultural representation of, or sponsorship by, the FRY (S/M) in the United States. Executive Order No. 12810 exempted from trade restrictions (1) transshipments through the FRY (S/M), and (2) activities related to the United Nations Protection Force (``UNPROFOR''), the Conference on Yugoslavia, or the European Community Monitor Mission. On January 15, 1993, President Bush issued Executive Order No. 12831 to implement new sanctions contained in U.N. Security Council Resolution 787 of November 16, 1992. The order revoked the exemption for transshipments through the FRY (S/M) contained in Executive Order No. 12810, prohibited transactions within the United States or by a U.S. person relating to FRY (S/M) vessels and vessels in which a majority or controlling interest is held by a person or entity in, or operating from, the FRY (S/M), and stated that all such vessels shall be considered as vessels of the FRY (S/M), regardless of the flag under which they sail. On April 25, 1993, I issued Executive Order No. 12846 to implement in the United States the sanctions adopted in UNSC Resolution 820 of April 17, 1993. That resolution called on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen peace plan for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and, if they failed to do so by April 26, called on member states to take additional measures to tighten the embargo against the FRY (S/M) and Serbian controlled areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the United Nations Protected Areas in Croatia. Effective April 26, 1993, the order blocked all property and interests in property of commercial, industrial, or public utility undertakings or entities organized or located in the FRY (S/M), including property and interests in property of entities (wherever organized or located) owned or controlled by such undertakings or entities, that are or thereafter come within the possession or control of U.S. persons. On October 25, 1994, in view of UNSC Resolution 942 of September 23, 1994, I issued Executive Order No. 12934 in order to take additional steps with respect to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. (59 FR 54117, October 27, 1994.) Executive Order No. 12934 expands the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12808 to address the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the territory in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control, including their refusal to accept the proposed territorial settlement of the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Executive order blocks all property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of United States persons (including their overseas branches) of: (1) the Bosnian Serb military and paramilitary forces and the authorities in areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of those forces; (2) any entity, including any commercial, industrial, or public utility undertaking, organized or located in those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces; (3) any entity, wherever organized or located, which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by any person in, or resident in, those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces; and (4) any person acting for or on behalf of any person within the scope of the above definitions. The Executive order also prohibits the provision or exportation of services to those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces, or to any person for the purpose of any business carried on in those areas, either from the United States or by a U.S. person. The order also prohibits the entry of any U.S.- flagged vessel, other than a U.S. naval vessel, into the riverine ports of those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnia Serb forces. Finally, any transaction by any U.S. person that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in the order is prohibited. Executive Order No. 12934 became effective at 11:59 p.m., e.d.t., on October 25, 1994. 2. The declaration of the national emergency on May 30, 1992, was made pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code. The emergency [[Page S 10240]] declaration was reported to the Congress on May 30, 1992, pursuant to section 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(b)) and the expansion of that National Emergency under the same authorities was reported to the Congress on October 25, 1994. The additional sanctions set forth in related Executive orders were imposed pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the statutes cited above, section 1114 of the Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C. App. 1514), and section 5 of the United Nations Participation Act (22 U.S.C. 287c). 3. There have been no amendments to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) Sanctions Regulations (the ``Regulations''), 31 C.F.R. Part 585, since the last report. The Treasury Department had previously published 853 names in the Federal Register on November 17, 1994 (59 FR 59460), as part of a comprehensive listing of all blocked persons and specially designated nationals (``SDNs'') of the FRY (S/M). This list identified individuals and entities determined by the Department of the Treasury to be owned or controlled by or acting for or on behalf of the Government of the FRY (S/M), persons in the FRY (S/M), or entities located or organized in or controlled from the FRY (S/M). All prohibitions in the Regulations pertaining to the Government of the FRY (S/M) apply to the entities and individuals identified. U.S. persons, on notice of the status of such blocked persons and specially designated nationals, are prohibited from entering into transactions with them, or transactions in which they have an interest, unless otherwise exempted or authorized pursuant to the Regulations. On February 22, 1995, pursuant to Executive Order 12934 and the Regulations, Treasury identified 85 individuals as leaders of the Bosnian Serb forces or civilian authorities in the territories in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control. Also on February 22, Treasury designated 19 individuals and 23 companies as SDNs of the FRY (S/M). These designations include FRY (S/M)-connected companies around the world that are being directed from Cyprus, two Cypriot-owned firms that have had a central role in helping establish and sustain sanctions-evading FRY (S/M) front companies in Cyprus, and the head of the FRY (S/M)'s Central Bank who is also the architect of the FRY (S/M) economic program. Additionally, on March 13, 1995, Treasury named 32 firms and eight individuals that are part of the Karic Brothers' family network of companies as SDNs of the FRY (S/M). Their enterprises span the globe and are especially active in former East Bloc countries. These additions and amendments, published in the Federal Register on April 18, 1995 (60 FR 19448), bring the current total of Blocked Entities and SDNs of the FRY (S/M) to 938 and the total number of individuals identified as leaders of the Bosnian Serb military or paramilitary forces or civilian authorities in the territories in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control to 85. A copy of the notice is attached. Treasury's blocking authority as applied to FRY (S/M) subsidiaries and vessels in the United States has been challenged in court. In Milena Ship Management Company, Ltd. v. Newcomb, 804 F Supp. 846, 855, and 859 (E.D.L.A. 1992) aff'd, 995 F.2d 620 (5th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S.Ct. 877 (1994), involving five ships owned or controlled by FRY (S/M) entities blocked in various U.S. ports, the blocking authority as applied to these vessels was upheld. In IPT Company, Inc. v. United States Department of the Treasury, No. 92 CIV 5542 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), the district court also upheld the blocking authority as applied to the property of a Yugoslav subsidiary located in the United States. The latter case is currently on appeal to the Second Circuit. 4. Over the past 6 months, the Departments of State and Treasury have worked closely with European Union (the ``EU'') member states and other U.N. member nations to coordinate implementation of the U.N. sanctions against the FRY (S/M). This has included visits by assessment teams formed under the auspices of the United States, the EU, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (the ``OSCE'') to states bordering on Serbia and Montenegro; continued deployment of OSCE sanctions assistance missions (``SAMs'') to Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine to assist in monitoring land and Danube River traffic; support for the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia (``ICFY'') monitoring missions along the Serbia-Montenegro-Bosnia border; bilateral contacts between the United States and other countries for the purpose of tightening financial and trade restrictions on the FRY (S/M); and ongoing multilateral meetings by financial sanctions enforcement authorities from various countries to coordinate enforcement efforts and to exchange technical information. 5. In accordance with licensing policy and the Regulations, FAC has exercised its authority to license certain specific transactions with respect to the FRY (S/M) that are consistent with U.S. foreign policy and the Security Council sanctions. During the reporting period, FAC has issued 109 specific licenses regarding transactions pertaining to the FRY (S/M) or assets it owns or controls, bringing the total as of April 25, 1995, to 930. Specific licenses have been issued (1) for payment to U.S. or third-country secured creditors, under certain narrowly-defined circumstances, for pre-embargo import and export transactions; (2) for legal representation or advice to the Government of the FRY (S/M) or FRY (S/M)--located or controlled entities; (3) for the liquidation or protection of tangible assets of subsidiaries of FRY (S/M)--located or controlled firms located in the U.S.; (4) for limited transactions related to FRY (S/M) diplomatic representation in Washington and New York; (S) for patent, trademark and copyright protection in the FRY (S/M) not involving payment to the FRY (S/M) Government; (6) for certain communications, news media, and travel- related transactions; (7) for the payment of crews' wages, vessel maintenance, and emergency supplies for FRY (S/M) controlled ships blocked in the United States; (8) for the removal from the FRY (S/M), or protection within the FRY (S/M), of certain property owned and controlled by U.S. entities; (9) to assist the United Nations in its relief operations and the activities of the U.N. Protection Force; and (10) for payment from funds outside the United States where a third country has licensed the transaction in accordance with U.N. sanctions. Pursuant to U.S. regulations implementing UNSC Resolutions, specific licenses have also been issued to authorize exportation of food, medicine, and supplies intended for humanitarian purposes in the FRY (S/M). During the past 6 months, FAC has continued to oversee the liquidation of tangible assets of the 15 U.S. subsidiaries of entities organized in the FRY (S/M). Subsequent to the issuance of Executive Order No. 12846, all operating licenses issued for these U.S.-located Serbian or Montenegrin subsidiaries or joint ventures were revoked, and the net proceeds of the liquidation of their assets placed in blocked accounts. In order to reduce the drain on blocked assets caused by continuing to rent commercial space, FAC arranged to have the blocked personality, files, and records of the two Serbian banking institutions in New York moved to secure storage. The personality is being liquidated, with the net proceeds placed in blocked accounts. Following the sale of the M/V Kapetan Martinovic in January 1995, five Yugoslav-owned vessels remain blocked in the United States. Approval of the UNSC's Serbian sanctions Committee was sought and obtained for the sale of the M/V Kapetan Martinovic (and the M/V Bor, which was sold in June 1994) based on U.S. assurances that the sale would comply with four basic conditions, which assure that both U.S. and U.N. sanctions objectives with respect to the FRY (S/M) are met: (1) the sale will be for fair market value; (2) the sale will result in a complete divestiture of any interest of the FRY (S/M) (or of commercial interests located in or controlled from the FRY (S/M) in the vessel; (3) the sale would result in no economic benefit to the FRY (S/ M) (or commercial interests located in or controlled from the FRY (S/ M)); and (4) the net proceeds of the sale (the gross proceeds less the costs of sale normally paid by the seller) will [[Page S 10241]] be placed in a blocked account in the United States. Negotiations for the sale of the M/V Bar, now blocked in New Orleans, are underway and are likely to be concluded prior to my next report. Other than the M/V Bar, the four remaining Yugoslav-owned vessels are beneficially owned by Jugooceanija, Plovidba of Kotor, Montenegro, and managed by Milena Ship Management Co. Ltd. in Malta. These vessels have many unpaid U.S. creditors for services and supplies furnished during the time they have been blocked in the United States; moreover, the owner appears to have insufficient resources to provide for the future upkeep and maintenance needs of these vessels and their crews. The United States is notifying the UNSC's Serbian Sanctions Committee of the United States's intention to license some or all of these remaining four vessels upon the owner's request. With the FAC-licensed sales of the M/V Kapetan Martinovic and the M/V Bor, those vessels were removed from the list of blocked FRY entities and merchant vessels maintained by FAC. The new owners of several formerly Yugoslav-owned vessels, which have been sold in other countries, have petitioned FAC to remove those vessels from the list. FAC, in coordination with the Department of State, is currently reviewing the sale terms and conditions for those vessels to ascertain whether they comply with U.N. sanctions objectives and UNSC's Serbian Sanctions Committee practice. During the past 6 months, U.S. financial institutions have continued to block funds transfers in which there is an interest of the Government of the FRY (S/M) or an entity or undertaking located in or controlled from the FRY (S/M), and to stop prohibited transfers to persons in the FRY (S/M). Such interdicted transfers have accounted for $125.6 million since the issuance of Executive Order No. 12808, including some $9.3 million during the past 6 months. To ensure compliance with the terms of the licenses that have been issued under the program, stringent reporting requirements are imposed. More than 279 submissions have been reviewed by FAC since the last report, and more than 125 compliance cases are currently open. 6. Since the issuance of Executive Order No. 12810, FAC has worked closely with the U.S. Customs Service to ensure both that prohibited imports and exports (including those in which the Government of the FRY (S/M) or Bosnian Serb authorities have an interest) are identified and interdicted, and that permitted imports and exports move to their intended destination without undue delay. Violations and suspected violations of the embargo are being investigated and appropriate enforcement actions are being taken. There are currently 37 cases under active investigation. Since the last report, FAC has collected nine civil penalties totaling nearly $20,000. Of these, five were paid by U.S. financial institutions for violative funds transfers involving the Government of the FRY (S/M), persons in the FRY (S/M), or entities located or organized in or controlled from the FRY (S/M). Three U.S. companies and one air carrier have also paid penalties related to exports or unlicensed payments to the Government of the FRY (S/M) or persons in the FRY (S/M) or other violations of the Regulations. 7. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month period from November 30, 1994, through May 29, 1995, that are directly attributable to the authorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency with respect to the FRY (S/M) and the Bosnian Serb forces and authorities are estimated at about $3.5 million, most of which represent wage and salary costs for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in the Department of the Treasury (particularly in FAC and its Chief Counsel's Office, and the U.S. Customs Service), the Department of State, the National Security Council, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Department of Commerce. 8. The actions and policies of the Government of the FRY (S/M), in its involvement in and support for groups attempting to seize and hold territory in the Republics of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina by force and violence, and the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina under their control, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The United States remains committed to a multilateral resolution of the conflict through implementation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions. I shall continue to exercise the powers at my disposal to apply economic sanctions against the FRY (S/M) and the Bosnian Serb forces, civil authorities, and entities, as long as these measures are appropriate, and will continue to report periodically to the Congress on significant developments pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c). William J. Clinton. The White House, July 18, 1995. ","['67 ', 'THE PRESIDING ', 'OFFICER ', ""laid before the Senate the following message from the President of the United States, together with an accompanying report; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. To the Congress of the United States: On May 30, 1992, in Executive Order No. 12808, the President declared a national emergency to deal with the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States arising from actions and policies of the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro, acting under the name of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, in their involvement in and support for groups attempting to seize territory in Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina by force and violence utilizing, in part, the forces of the so-called Yugoslav National Army (57 FR 23299, June 2, 1992). I expanded the national emergency in Executive Order No. 12934 of October 25, 1994, to address the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control. The present report is submitted pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1641(c) and 1703(c). It discusses Administration actions and expenses directly related to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order No. 12808 and Executive Order No. 12934 and to expanded sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) (the ``FRY (S/M)'') and the Bosnian Serbs contained in Executive Order No. 12810 of June 5, 1992 (57 FR 24347, June 9, 1992), Executive Order No. 12831 of January 15, 1993 (58 FR 5253, Jan. 21, 1993), Executive Order No. 12846 of April 25, 1993 (58 FR 25771, April 27, 1993), and Executive Order No. 12934 of October 25, 1994 (59 FR 54117, October 27, 1994). 1. Executive Order No. 12808 blocked all property and interests in property of the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro, or held in the name of the former Government of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, then or thereafter located in the United States or within the possession or control of U.S. persons, including their overseas branches. Subsequently, Executive Order No. 12810 expanded U.S. actions to implement in the United States the United Nations sanctions against the FRY (S/M) adopted in United Nations Security Council (``"", ""UNSC'"", ""') Resolution 757 of May 30, 1992. In addition to reaffirming the blocking of FRY (S/M) Government property, this order prohibited transactions with respect to the FRY (S/M) involving imports, exports, dealing in FRY-origin property, air and sea transportation, contract performance, funds transfers, activity promoting importation or exportation or dealings in property, and official sports, scientific, technical, or other cultural representation of, or sponsorship by, the FRY (S/M) in the United States. Executive Order No. 12810 exempted from trade restrictions (1) transshipments through the FRY (S/M), and (2) activities related to the United Nations Protection Force (``"", ""UNPROFOR'"", ""'), the Conference on Yugoslavia, or the European Community Monitor Mission. On January 15, 1993, President Bush issued Executive Order No. 12831 to implement new sanctions contained in U.N. Security Council Resolution 787 of November 16, 1992. The order revoked the exemption for transshipments through the FRY (S/M) contained in Executive Order No. 12810, prohibited transactions within the United States or by a U.S. person relating to FRY (S/M) vessels and vessels in which a majority or controlling interest is held by a person or entity in, or operating from, the FRY (S/M), and stated that all such vessels shall be considered as vessels of the FRY (S/M), regardless of the flag under which they sail. On April 25, 1993, I issued Executive Order No. 12846 to implement in the United States the sanctions adopted in "", 'UNSC ', 'Resolution 820 of April 17, 1993. That resolution called on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen peace plan for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and, if they failed to do so by April 26, called on member states to take additional measures to tighten the embargo against the FRY (S/M) and Serbian controlled areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the United Nations Protected Areas in Croatia. Effective April 26, 1993, the order blocked all property and interests in property of commercial, industrial, or public utility undertakings or entities organized or located in the FRY (S/M), including property and interests in property of entities (wherever organized or located) owned or controlled by such undertakings or entities, that are or thereafter come within the possession or control of U.S. persons. On October 25, 1994, in view of ', 'UNSC ', 'Resolution 942 of September 23, 1994, I issued Executive Order No. 12934 in order to take additional steps with respect to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. (59 FR 54117, October 27, 1994.) Executive Order No. 12934 expands the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12808 to address the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the territory in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control, including their refusal to accept the proposed territorial settlement of the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Executive order blocks all property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of United States persons (including their overseas branches) of: (1) the Bosnian Serb military and paramilitary forces and the authorities in areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of those forces; (2) any entity, including any commercial, industrial, or public utility undertaking, organized or located in those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces; (3) any entity, wherever organized or located, which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by any person in, or resident in, those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces; and (4) any person acting for or on behalf of any person within the scope of the above definitions. The Executive order also prohibits the provision or exportation of services to those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces, or to any person for the purpose of any business carried on in those areas, either from the United States or by a U.S. person. The order also prohibits the entry of any U.S.- flagged vessel, other than a U.S. naval vessel, into the riverine ports of those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnia Serb forces. Finally, any transaction by any U.S. person that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in the order is prohibited. Executive Order No. 12934 became effective at 11:59 p.m., e.d.t., on October 25, 1994. 2. The declaration of the national emergency on May 30, 1992, was made pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code. The emergency [[', 'Page S ', ""10240]] declaration was reported to the Congress on May 30, 1992, pursuant to section 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(b)) and the expansion of that National Emergency under the same authorities was reported to the Congress on October 25, 1994. The additional sanctions set forth in related Executive orders were imposed pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the statutes cited above, section 1114 of the Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C. App. 1514), and section 5 of the United Nations Participation Act (22 U.S.C. 287c). 3. There have been no amendments to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) Sanctions Regulations (the ``Regulations''), 31 C.F.R. Part 585, since the last report. The Treasury Department had previously published 853 names in the Federal Register on November 17, 1994 (59 FR 59460), as part of a comprehensive listing of all blocked persons and specially designated nationals (``SDNs'') of the FRY (S/M). This list identified individuals and entities determined by the Department of the Treasury to be owned or controlled by or acting for or on behalf of the Government of the FRY (S/M), persons in the FRY (S/M), or entities located or organized in or controlled from the FRY (S/M). All prohibitions in the Regulations pertaining to the Government of the FRY (S/M) apply to the entities and individuals identified. U.S. persons, on notice of the status of such blocked persons and specially designated nationals, are prohibited from entering into transactions with them, or transactions in which they have an interest, unless otherwise exempted or authorized pursuant to the Regulations. On February 22, 1995, pursuant to Executive Order 12934 and the Regulations, Treasury identified 85 individuals as leaders of the Bosnian Serb forces or civilian authorities in the territories in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control. Also on February 22, Treasury designated 19 individuals and 23 companies as SDNs of the FRY (S/M). These designations include FRY (S/M)-connected companies around the world that are being directed from Cyprus, two Cypriot-owned firms that have had a central role in helping establish and sustain sanctions-evading FRY (S/M) front companies in Cyprus, and the head of the FRY (S/M)'s Central Bank who is also the architect of the FRY (S/M) economic program. Additionally, on March 13, 1995, Treasury named 32 firms and eight individuals that are part of the Karic Brothers' family network of companies as SDNs of the FRY (S/M). Their enterprises span the globe and are especially active in former East Bloc countries. These additions and amendments, published in the Federal Register on April 18, 1995 (60 FR 19448), bring the current total of Blocked Entities and SDNs of the FRY (S/M) to 938 and the total number of individuals identified as leaders of the Bosnian Serb military or paramilitary forces or civilian authorities in the territories in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control to 85. A copy of the notice is attached. Treasury's blocking authority as applied to FRY (S/M) subsidiaries and vessels in the United States has been challenged in court. In Milena Ship Management Company, Ltd. v. Newcomb, 804 F Supp. 846, 855, and 859 (E.D.L.A. 1992) aff'd, 995 F.2d 620 (5th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S.Ct. 877 (1994), involving five ships owned or controlled by FRY (S/M) entities blocked in various U.S. ports, the blocking authority as applied to these vessels was upheld. "", 'In IPT ', ""Company, Inc. v. United States Department of the Treasury, No. 92 CIV 5542 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), the district court also upheld the blocking authority as applied to the property of a Yugoslav subsidiary located in the United States. The latter case is currently on appeal to the Second Circuit. 4. Over the past 6 months, the Departments of State and Treasury have worked closely with European Union (the ``EU'') member states and other U.N. member nations to coordinate implementation of the U.N. sanctions against the FRY (S/M). This has included visits by assessment teams formed under the auspices of the United States, the EU, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (the ``"", ""OSCE'"", ""') to states bordering on Serbia and Montenegro; continued deployment of "", 'OSCE ', ""sanctions assistance missions (``SAMs'') to Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine to assist in monitoring land and Danube River traffic; support for the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia (``"", ""ICFY'"", ""') monitoring missions along the Serbia-Montenegro-Bosnia border; bilateral contacts between the United States and other countries for the purpose of tightening financial and trade restrictions on the FRY (S/M); and ongoing multilateral meetings by financial sanctions enforcement authorities from various countries to coordinate enforcement efforts and to exchange technical information. 5. In accordance with licensing policy and the "", 'Regulations, FAC ', ""has exercised its authority to license certain specific transactions with respect to the FRY (S/M) that are consistent with U.S. foreign policy and the Security Council sanctions.

Protection Force; and (10) for payment from funds outside the United States where a third country has licensed the transaction in accordance with U.N. sanctions.

7,"CONCERNS REGARDING AMERICA SENDING PEACEKEEPING TROOPS TO BOSNIA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from California [Mr. Cunningham] is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, I know Members on both sides of the aisle are anguishing on whether we send troops or not to Bosnia. Let me give a few of this Member's concerns. First of all, I have had not one constituent walk up to me and say, ``Duke, send our troops.'' Quite on the contrary, it has been overwhelmingly ``Duke, try to stop it if you can.'' Second, General Boyd and General MacKenzie, both in charge in that portion of the world in Bosnia-Herzegovina have stated: ``Stay out. It will be a disaster.'' These are the two generals that headed up our forces in that particular part of the world. I look at the cost. NATO has said that it is not $2.2, but by the end it will cost us $3 billion to $6 billion. The President just signed a balanced budget in 7 years agreement. Where is the money going to come from? Even if you have a supplemental, you have to offset it. You have to pay for it. We cannot do that. NATO is broke today, billions of dollars. France said just 2 weeks ago that we can plan on a 20-year commitment with NATO in that portion of the world. Who is going to end up paying for that, Mr. Speaker? We are. The President said that the primary source of nation building will come from Europe. It also leaves a lot of room for the United States. We are looking at billions of dollars when we are talking about a time when balancing a budget, providing for Medicare, and a lot of other things that the other side is arguing against it. I also look at the $4,000, much of it deemed. These are not the Bosnian Muslims, but primarily those from Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Albania, that are the radicals. If they are allowed to stay in that portion of the world, these are the ones that have sworn a worldwide Jihad against Jews, Christians, and all nonbelievers. They will attack our troops, and they have got to go. We have got to demand equal treatment. That has not happened in the past. Have Serbs and Croatians and Muslims committed atrocious acts? Absolutely, all three groups. But we need not to train one side. Can you imagine during this peace agreement, we go in and train any side or give arms to any side? If I was on any one of the other two, I would say that is an act of war. I think that is the plan. Who would come in with arms? France, Iran, Iraq, Russia, and yes, Mr. Speaker, even the United States, to sell arms. I think that would be disastrous. I have another concern.

Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from California [Mr. Cunningham] is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, I know Members on both sides of the aisle are anguishing on whether we send troops or not to Bosnia. Let me give a few of this Member's concerns. First of all, I have had not one constituent walk up to me and say, ``Duke, send our troops.'' Quite on the contrary, it has been overwhelmingly ``Duke, try to stop it if you can.'' Second, General Boyd and General MacKenzie, both in charge in that portion of the world in Bosnia-Herzegovina have stated: ``Stay out. It will be a disaster.'' These are the two generals that headed up our forces in that particular part of the world. I look at the cost. NATO has said that it is not $2.2, but by the end it will cost us $3 billion to $6 billion. The President just signed a balanced budget in 7 years agreement. Where is the money going to come from? Even if you have a supplemental, you have to offset it. You have to pay for it. We cannot do that. NATO is broke today, billions of dollars. France said just 2 weeks ago that we can plan on a 20-year commitment with NATO in that portion of the world. Who is going to end up paying for that, Mr. Speaker? We are. The President said that the primary source of nation building will come from Europe. It also leaves a lot of room for the United States. We are looking at billions of dollars when we are talking about a time when balancing a budget, providing for Medicare, and a lot of other things that the other side is arguing against it. I also look at the $4,000, much of it deemed. These are not the Bosnian Muslims, but primarily those from Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Albania, that are the radicals. If they are allowed to stay in that portion of the world, these are the ones that have sworn a worldwide Jihad against Jews, Christians, and all nonbelievers. They will attack our troops, and they have got to go. We have got to demand equal treatment. That has not happened in the past. Have Serbs and Croatians and Muslims committed atrocious acts? Absolutely, all three groups. But we need not to train one side. Can you imagine during this peace agreement, we go in and train any side or give arms to any side? If I was on any one of the other two, I would say that is an act of war. I think that is the plan. Who would come in with arms? France, Iran, Iraq, Russia, and yes, Mr. Speaker, even the United States, to sell arms. I think that would be disastrous. I have another concern. President Clinton is going to be in a campaign mode over the next year. During Desert Storm, President Bush was focused. Colin Powell was focused. Dick Cheney was focused on Desert Storm, not on political activities coming up.

8,"REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR DEBATE AND CONSIDERATION OF THREE MEASURES RELATING TO U.S. TROOP DEPLOYMENTS IN BOSNIA ______ speech of HON. RODNEY P. FRELINGHUYSEN of new jersey in the house of representatives Wednesday, December 13, 1995 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, for me, the most important priority is to support our servicemen and women. The President has made the decision, and while I am angry that he made it without consultation with Congress and the American people, we need to back them 100 percent. Our actions tonight should send this message loudly and clearly to them as they prepare to go. Because 25 years ago, I was one of them in Vietnam. I was sent on a mission that bitterly divided this country and this House. But I learned then, as I know now, that our troops deserve nothing less than the undivided support of this House and all the resources necessary to support their mission. Please support the Buyer resolution. We have all seen vivid and shockingly graphic pictures from Bosnia, but my visit there made the issue intensely human. I spoke with our troops on their way to the region from Germany, met with the Balkan leaders, wore a flak jacket, and took a bumpy bus ride into war-torn Sarajevo. No doubt, watching CNN and seeing things live are completely different. No longer is this a civil war in a faraway land, it is 32,000 American troops going into a historically troubled region as peacemakers. President Clinton made that decision. He made it without congressional approval, but as Commander in Chief he has the authority to do this. In fact, it became clear that he made this decision long ago, since we learned from our troops that their training for this mission began more than 6 to 8 months prior to the Dayton peace talks. We are going to Bosnia, and in some areas our soldiers are already there. On November 30, I was selected to join a bipartisan congressional delegation to survey the Bosnian situation. Our trip was organized in response to concerns in Congress that the White House had not kept us informed of this major policy decision in a proper and timely manner. Indeed, State Department and Pentagon officials were dispatched to Capitol Hill just 1 day before we boarded our plane to Serbia. We went with objectives--ours was a true fact-finding mission. Before leaving, we were briefed by Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, the chief U.S. negotiator at the Dayton peace accords. We were to meet with Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian leaders to solidify their support for the peace accord and to get their assurances that United States forces would be protected. Our foremost objective was to verify that our troops would have the training, equipment, and resources necessary to defend and protect themselves. We met with Serbian President Milosevic, Croatian President Tudjman and Bosnian President Izetbegovic. They remain committed to the peace agreement, pledged their support of protection for U.S. troops, and shared the fact that their citizens were truly weary from war. They said Americans were considered to be even-handed and that our military presence was vital for peace. Despite their words, they remain suspect due to past broken promises, and because facts show that these were indeed the very warmakers that caused 250,000 deaths in over 3\1/2\ years of ethnic and religious strife. As President Reagan used to say, ``trust but verify.'' Our trip to Sarajevo is one I'll never forget. We landed at the airport which was little more than a small pitted concrete platform surrounded by sandbags and bunkers. After an escort of U.N. armored vehicles was assembled, we boarded a bus and headed toward the city. We went through four Bosnian Serb armed checkpoints and saw defused land mines along the roadside which had previously lined our path. Along our well-protected route, the pictures came to life--buildings blown apart, people milling around, and everywhere burned out buses, trolleys, and cars. The 8-mile trip took almost 45 minutes. What was left of the architectural beauty of structures from the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or the towering high-rise buildings built during Marshall Tito's 30-year-reign, was now a twisted combination of bombed-out building shells, collapsed factories, or acres of roofless and pockmarked houses. Sarajevo is undoubtedly a scarred survivor. I remember, too, the stories of no food, heat, or fresh water, and the chilling testimonials of snipers killing pedestrians in the street and marketplace. There were constant reminders of the 2\1/2\ million refugees who were either burned and bombed out of their houses and communities, or simply fled the area with terror. After this eye-opener, we flew to Naples, Italy, for a briefing by the U.S. Southern Commander of NATO forces, Adm. Leighton Smith. He told us that our troops would be able to defend themselves, would be fully equipped, and that the military mission was limited to a year. ``American troops would be enforcing a peace'', he said, ``not fighting a war.'' He was honest, however, and reminded us that this mission was not without risk. Our final stop was the most moving--meeting with our young soldiers in Germany who will go to Bosnia in mid-December. I had lunch with two soldiers from New Jersey, one a very young woman, perhaps early 20's, from Burlington County and the other a slightly older man from Bergen County. Both were professional, well-trained, and motivated. Still, I sensed apprehension--the same apprehension I felt 25 years ago as a young private headed to Vietnam. This encounter placed everything in perspective and literally put a human face on this situation. For me, the most important priority for us is to support our servicemen and women. They are Americans, with over 80,000 family members on the homefront. No question, the President should better define our national interest in Bosnia and explain what our total commitment will be. I feel he has an obligation to the families of our troops and all Americans to outline the specific objectives of this mission. But while we can argue about his policy, which I do remain skeptical about, the fact is that the decision has been made and American soldiers, our soldiers, are going. And since they are going, we need to support them 100 percent. They deserve nothing less.

9,"REMARKS BY MILES LERMAN AT THE NATIONAL DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE CEREMONY ______ HON. TOM LANTOS of california in the house of representatives Thursday, May 30, 1996 Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, on April 16, Members of Congress, members of the Diplomatic Corps and hundreds of survivors of the Holocaust and their friends gathered here in the Capitol Rotunda for the National Days of Remembrance commemoration. The United States Holocaust Memorial Council was established by Congress to preserve the memory of the victims of the Holocaust. I commend the Council and the members of the Days of Remembrance Committee, chaired by my good friend Benjamin Meed, for their vigilant and genuine adherence to their extraordinarily important task. One of the first acts of the Council was to establish the annual Days of Remembrance commemoration to mirror similar observances held in Israel and throughout our Nation and elsewhere in the world. This year, the commemoration centered on the 50th anniversary of the Nuremberg trials. The observance was a reminder of the difficult process of first coping and then healing that all survivors and their families and loved ones had to endure. I commend my colleagues' attention to the insightful comments of my good friend Miles Lerman. Miles was instrumental in bringing the dream of the Holocaust Memorial Museum to reality, an immense project that is universally regarded as a resounding success. As Chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council, Miles is appointed by the President to coordinate our national effort to memorialize the victims of the Holocaust and to teach all Americans its many lessons. His words at the National Days of Remembrance commemoration are a demonstration of his outstanding ability to carry out this important task. Days of Remembrance Ceremony (By Miles Lerman) Distinguished Dignitaries, Honorable Members of Congress, ladies and gentlemen. The theme of this year's days of remembrance is the 50th anniversary of the Nuremberg Trials. What makes these trials so significant is the fact that the Allied Forces after victory did not pursue vengeance. Instead they chose to implement a due process of law to hold the German political and military leaders personally accountable for the heinous crimes they committed against humanity. We will hear more of those trial proceedings from Justice Breyer, who will analyze the uniqueness of the Nuremberg trials and place them in the proper historic prospective. I will, therefore, concentrate my remarks on the importance of remembrance. Remembrance serves many purposes. It helps us look back and wonder how different the fate of Holocaust victims would have been if the Western leaders of those days would have had the stamina at the outset to stand up to Adolph Hitler--a political megalomaniac whose appetite for territorial expansion was unsatiated; whose wild dream of developing a Deutsche heren rasse--a German super race which would enslave all nations he would conquer and create a Third Reich that would last a thousand years. This insanity could have been stopped in time but it was not. The leaders of Britain and France wanted to believe that they could reason with Adolph Hitler and thus continued to give in to his constantly escalating demands until they finally came to realize that they were dealing with a monster that must be subdued at any price. By this time, however, Hitler had managed to build a powerful war machine which took enormous sacrifices on the part of all Allied Armies who waged battles from the desserts of Africa to Leningrad and Normandy to defeat the Nazi monster. It took 6 years of bloody battles with millions of casualties and billions of dollars of military equipment to put an end to the Nazi nightmare that could have been stopped at a much earlier stage. It is a myth--it is a falsehood to believe that only Hitler and his SS henchmen were the ones who were responsible for the mass murder. In the Archives of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, we have documents proving that the entire industrial complex of Nazi Germany was involved in the process of mass annihilation. We have documents of German engineering firms praising the efficiency of the crematories they are offering for sale. We have copies of authentic bids from German chemical companies soliciting the orders for the Cyclone B gas enunciating the economic efficiency of their product for the mass killing of women and children. We dwell on this past not to inflame fury, but because we believe that in the ashes of this tragic past lies an all important lesson essential to our collective future as a democratic and free society where human differences are respected and human rights are protected. This is what the Holocaust Memorial Museum is all about. When the Nazi nightmare was finally brought to an end, the world chose to believe that the lessons of this horrible period would once and for all put an end to hatred and bigotry. Today, 50 years later, we must admit that we were naively optimistic. The sad facts are, the world has not learned its lesson. Once again, we are confronted with savageries of the worst kind all over the world. Futile ethnic cleansings and senseless carnage are still rampant. Not only in the distant places such as former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, but the venom of hatred and bigotry has embedded itself even in the heartland of America. This phenomena should be of great concern to all of us. There are, however, those who argue not to pay too much attention to these crackpots because they are only a marginal fringe of our democratic society. So permit me to invoke memory and remind you that the same arguments were heard in Germany in the early 30's when Hitler began his quest for power. Today we are beginning to see more and more blatant disregard and lack of respect for the sanctity of martyrdom. Let me cite to you just two examples. Only recently have we learned that Franjo Tudjman, the President of Croatia, has announced plans to bring to Jasenovac the bones of the Croatian Ustashis. The Ustashis were Hitler's most willing collaborators. Today, President Tudjman wants to mingle the bones of the Ustashis killers with the bones of victims whom they have murdered in Jasenovac. Jasenovac is the largest death camp of Yugoslavia where tens of thousands of victims are buried in mass graves. This proposed callous desecration of the Jasenovac Memorial cannot be permitted to happen. I have conveyed to President Tudjman our outrage over this defilement and have advised him that the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council will not remain silent until these evil plans are scrapped. Another example is Auschwitz. In Auschwitz, plans were in the making to build a shopping center only 100 yards away from the camp perimeter. Again, we expressed our dismay, we intervened and protested--this time successfully. I am pleased to inform you that I have received written confirmation from Polish Ambassador, Jerzy Kozminsky, that the development of the shopping center within the confines of Auschwitz has been canceled. The Polish authorities are to be commended for putting a stop to what would have been a painful desecration of memory. The Nuremberg trials teach us that we cannot remain indifferent; we cannot look the other way when evil plans are in the making; when atrocities take place and the truth is distorted. We must always be ready to speak out against evil no matter where it takes place--and no matter who the victims are. The victims of the Nazi inferno deserve the dignity of being left in peace and we at the Holocaust Memorial Council are determined to do all that is in our power to make sure that the ashes of the victims remain undefiled and undisturbed. This is our sacred task that we must fulfill today, tomorrow and in years to come.

10,"WHY WE SHOULD NOT BE IN BOSNIA The Speaker pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of May 12, 1995, the gentleman from California [Mr. Dornan] is recognized for 60 minutes. Mr. DORNAN. I did not realize your time was wrapping up, Mr. Burton. I just wanted to, in a colloquy with you, underscore what you said about the targeting of Americans by people from outside Bosnia. The MOIS, the secret police of Iran, have people in all the areas in Bosnia and around there. They are the security for shipping arms to the Moslem Bosnians through Zagreb with the complicity, the tolerance of the Croatian Government, all the way up to President Franjo Tudjman. They have targeted Americans for over a year. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. And they are having Americans killed, you might add. Mr. DORNAN. Yes. Now here is what adds a dimension to this today. Someone who has told me who I trust--now this makes it hearsay and puts it in the category of rumor for our friends in the dominant media culture. The liberals will go wild here, but a meeting took place at the White House, all the key players from Defense and from the State Department and security agencies, and Clinton himself expressed concern and asked many questions about the mujaheddin from Iran, the bad mujaheddin, just like we had good and bad in Afghanistan--the Hamas, some of the groups you have named, and the secret police, the terrorist secret police of Iran. He asked about them targeting Americans. He has known about this for a year. {time} 1645 The President is purported to have said, looking at Leon Panetta, my classmate from 1976, ``Do not let the Congress get fired up on this. Downplay this when you talk to the Congressmen and the Senators.'' In other words, instead of telling the American people the danger that we are in, and, to quote his own words which I will do in a minute, he is asking them to downplay the threat to our Americans. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. If the gentleman will continue to yield, the fact of the matter is we know there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Moslem terrorists from Iran who are in the Bosnia area right now. We do not know how many. We have no idea. The fact of the matter is that some of those people were involved in such tragedies here in America as the World Trade Center bombing. They do not like our policies, they do not like America very much. When you put troops, American troops strung out between, say, Sarajevo and Tuzla, that long corridor 2\1/2\ miles wide, you are leaving them open for an attack anyplace among that line. That means that you are probably going to have, anyplace along that corridor for Sarajevo to Tuzla that there could be a bomber, there could be a mortar attack, there could be any kind of attack on our troops and they will not know when it is coming. I remember when President Clinton had a number of us in the White House when we were in Mogadishu, in Somalia. The President came up with a new policy. He said he was going to billet our troops on the tarmac at the airport there in Mogadishu. He said they would be safe. They would be there as a security measure, but they would not be involved in any combat or other operations. This was after we started nation building, we quit the food handling over there. Two days later the Aideed forces, the terrorist tribal leader over there, lobbed mortars into the exact spot where our soldiers were going to be billeted. That was not anything like Bosnia, yet if we had had troops in that area where the President said they were going to be, and they found out about it, there would have been many of them killed. Think about that when you talk about a corridor between Sarajevo and Tuzla, 2\1/2\ miles wide with 25,000 American troops in there. They could pick any spot along there, any time day or night, attack our troops and kill hundreds, maybe thousands of them. This is a recipe for disaster. I appreciate the gentleman for yielding to me. The President should reconsider, and he should come clean with the American people. If he said what you alleged he said to Leon Panetta, you know, we do not let the Congress get into this thing, then he should be taken to task. I do not know if he said it or not. The American people need to know the risks. There are going to be young women lose their legs, their arms, their eyes from these land mines, but even a greater risk is the possibility of a terrorist attack from possibly Bosnian Serbs who are going to be upset about losing their homes and the problems around Sarajevo, or possibly Moslem terrorist from Iran. There are a number of people who do not like what is going on over there. They do not like anybody very much. I think our troops are really at risk. It is a mistake to get into this quagmire. Mr. DORNAN. Dan, stay with me just a minute here, because I have been to Central America with you several times, we have both been to Haiti and been very concerned about what is happening there. We both have taken a personal interest in the calls that are coming into our offices from families of men who are in active duty in Germany and who resented Clinton referring to them as volunteers. One mother said to one of my staffers, My son is not a French legionnaire or a mercenary, he did not join the military to fight under any flag, he joined and took an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And he did take a follow-on order that we do not take as Congressmen Newt would like this probably at this point, that we will obey all lawful orders of our commander. But it is coming down to the word ``lawful.'' Because you suffered through Mogadishu and spoke so forcefully and eloquently on the floor, I want to share something with you. When I was in my thirties I produced my own TV show. We had, the year I started, just gotten state-of-the-art close-up lenses where we could go in on an ant on the set and fill someone's television screen at home with that ant. Here we are, 27 years later, since I first started in December of 1967 28 years later, and we cannot call for a close-up with these good Americans down in the control room a couple of floors below us, and it is too bad. I think the day is going to come, just like some day we will have color in the Congressional Record. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I would like for them to see this map. Mr. DORNAN. If they can see this Posavina corridor that we are supposed to widen by the Dayton-Wright Patterson treaty, widen and enforce---- Mr. BURTON of Indiana. If the Americans could see the corridor we are supposed to try to defend---- Mr. DORNAN. Hold that steady and maybe the camera here in the southeast corner of the House could come in, point with your finger---- Mr. BURTON of Indiana. It is going to run all the way this way. Mr. DORNAN. Take it from there at the top. The little pink strip there, between the part of Serb-held Bosnia that is against Milosevic's Bosnia-Serbia proper and Montenegro, and this huge glob in the northern part of what is Bosnia, this little, tiny Posavina corridor, 2\1/2\ miles, is supposed to be expanded to five. Keep in mind the Israelis were properly always exercised about the distance from the furthest west point of the West Bank, Judea, from Natanya, by the sea, was 18 miles. They say that is an artillery-lobbed shell. This is 2\1/2\. Our men---- Mr. BURTON of Indiana. You have been in the military you might tell our [[Page H 13788]] colleagues how far a mortar will go, how far they can stay back from that 2\1/2\-mile-wide corridor to hit American troops if they wanted to lob something in there. Mr. DORNAN. The mortars that hit the marketplace in Tuzla when I was in Zagreb the 28th of August, and threw bodies every which way, killed 60 or 70 people and maimed 150; when I look at that ``maimed,'' I always think ``Who is blind? Who has no legs there? Who lost all their fingers there?'' We always put the death toll in bigger caps than the maimed. That is lives changed forever. A person will never earn the same income. Those mortars could be 5 or 10 miles from the corridor and lob these shells into the corridor. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. The point is they could get within a half a mile and be more accurately targeted in. That is the problem. Mr. DORNAN. I wish almost, like in every television show, we had a monitor buried in the table here so we could see. I don't know how close they can come in on this picture, but I am going to walk over there and give it to you so you can look at this handsome young American soldier's face, First Sergeant Randall Shughart. I visited his grave 2 weeks ago in Carlisle, PA. His parents sent me this picture because they did not like the standard Army picture. They said, ``This is more what Randy looked like when he was helping us on the farm.'' I am sure that as close as they can get, it is just a color picture of a handsome young fellow with a closely cropped beard and a cowboy hat, in his barn. Take a look at this while I tell you this story. Randy Shughart, together with Gary Gordon, begged the headquarters at Mogadishu International Airport to let them go down and disembark from their helicopter, because they could see movement in the cockpit of Michael Durant's crashed Blackhawk helicopter. Three times they were told no. They were, in a sense, because they knew the odds, begging to die for their friends. St. John the Evangelist 15:13, ``Greater love no man has than he died for his friends.'' They saved Durant. Durant hugging me, and both of us crying, told me that he owes his life to Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon. All four men had spine injuries when that helicopter made a hard landing. The helicopter that he disembarked took a direct hit of a rocket-propelled grenade and blew out one of the door posts and tore the leg right off one of the door gunners. I talked to the young Corporal Hall who jumped in and took over the door gun, and they flew back to Newport and crashed the helicopter, totaling it out. So that day we lost Wolcott's helicopter, Cliff Wolcott, killing him and his pilot, and then we lost this one, Durant's, and then we lost that one to a total accident after they were out of it. They held off for about 30 minutes. I have asked the Army for their last transcriptions. Durant told me the last thing Gordon or Shughart said to him was ``Good luck, pal. I hope you make it.'' Went around the front of the helicopter, heard him take a couple of shots, heard him grunt with pain. Hopefully they died with the rifle shots as the crowd overwhelmed the helicopter and captured Durant. Durant told me another man was lying on the ground, and I will not give his name because of his parents, and he was taken alive with Durant. They beat him to death. Then they began to so abuse their bodies that now that it is 2 years and 2 months later, a former Congressman said to me tonight, ``Congressman, these men are owned by America. Why don't you tell the country what happened to them?'' I will not, but I will go further than I have ever gone before. These five men, including the two that won the Medal of Honor and including Randy Shughart's picture you have there, they did not just mutilate their bodies and drag them through the streets and stick rifles and poles into every bodily orifice, including their mouths, and have women and children dance upon them in the streets for Canadian Broadcasting, the guy won a Pulitzer Prize for his video and film coverage, Paul something, they cut their arms off the bodies. We never got those limbs back. They dumped their burned remains on the steps of the United Nation every 2 days until we had gotten back---- Mr. BURTON of Indiana. If I may interrupt, that was never reported to the American people? Mr. DORNAN. Never. Look at Randy's handsome face, and he was born in Lincoln, NE. I showed this to our Medal of Honor winner, the Senator from Nebraska, Bob Kerrey, and he started at him intently, and I said, ``This guy is from Lincoln.'' And he said, ``Are you sure?'' and I said yes, I thought he was buried there. And then the Army told me where, so I went to his grave, because the week before when I was at a presidential forum in Bangor, ME, and I had asked where the other Lincoln was, in Lincoln, ME, where Gary Gordon is from. ``Two Young Men from Lincoln'' is the story I would like to write. They said, ``50 minutes north of here,'' and I took my son and drove up this first week of November to Gary Gordon's grave. I said to Mark, ``I want to see Randy Shughart's grave.'' His dad, that man there, his father is the one who refused to shake Clinton's hand in the East Ballroom of the White House, and Bob Kerrey, Senator, told me he was at this ceremony and remembers it vividly. I said, ``How is it Bob, the press never reported that story, that it only came out on talk radio?'' Mr. Shughart, a basic American farmer type, retired in Carlisle near his son's grave. He told me that he said to Clinton, ``Why did you fly Aideed down to Addis Abbaba days after this people killed and multilated my son's body?'' Mr. BURTON of Indiana. He was the dictator and tribal terrorist over there that was responsible for that. Mr. DORNAN. Another Fidel Castro, another General Jopp, another Aristide, the same mold, all of them. He said Clinton told him, ``I did not know about that operation.'' Mr. BURTON of Indiana. If the gentleman will yield, that is a ludicrous statement for anybody to make, because the administration had their Ambassador over there, negotiating with Aideed during a lot of this stuff that was going on. They knew entirely, from intelligence sources, what was going on. It is absolutely unbelievable that they would make a statement like that. Let me just add one more thing. Mr. DORNAN. It is Clinton making the statement to the father of a dead, murdered, Medal of Honor winner. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I just cannot believe that is the case. The President said in his speech---- Mr. DORNAN. He meant the operation, taking Aideed down to Addis Abbaba. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. The President said, ``I take full responsibility for whatever might happen over there.'' The fact of the matter is he should take full responsibility for what happened in Mogadishu to those men who got killed. They did not send proper equipment there, they did not send M-1 A-1 tanks, they did not send Bradley armored vehicles. He knew they should have sent those over there. The men trapped there, they did not get to them in that little town for 40 or 50 minutes because they could not get through the crowds. Mr. DORNAN. Eleven and one-half hours before they relieved the Rangers. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. The fact of the matter is we lost some of those men because we did not get there quick enough. Mr. DORNAN. Four or five died during the night. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. The fact of the matter is we are going to lose more young men and women, many more times, 40 or 50 more times in Bosnia. I think the President is making a terrible mistake. Mr. SCARBBOROUGH. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. DORNAN. I yield to the gentleman from Florida. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. I thank the gentleman from California for yielding, and thank him for all of his service on the Committee on National Security, where we have worked together. I certainly appreciate the comments you have made about the horrible treatment that American soldiers have to go through, and humanizing this process. Let me tell you something that really has disturbed me during this debate. There have been three falsehoods. The first is that we should blindly fall in line behind our Commander in Chief, regardless of what he suggests. We [[Page H 13789]] should send out troops, whether we know if there is a vital American interest, a time line, or all of the things we need to make this successful. I remember back in the mid-1990's, before I was in Congress, and you were here, maybe you can expand on this in a minute or two, just to remind Americans that there can be a loyal opposition. I remember when we were trying to remove Communists, when Ronald Reagan was trying to remove Communists from Central America, there were actually Members of this body that wrote Communist leader Ortega in Nicaragua and apologized for our support of the freedom fighters. These same people tell us that we cannot even debate this openly, so America can decide whether they want young American men and women killed in Bosnia? Let us make no mistake of it, we have sat through the briefings on the Committee on National Security. Everybody that comes in says, ``Young Americans will die if they go to Bosnia and get involved in a civil war that has been raging for over 500 years.'' What have we kept asking? We have kept saying, ``What is the vital American interest?'' {time} 1700 They have set up straw men and tried to knock them down, saying that if we did not get involved that somehow our credibility in NATO would be greatly diminished. That is a joke. The fact of the matter is, we are NATO. We have protected NATO countries for a generation from the threat of communism, and we will continue. Mr. DORNAN. A generation and a half. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. A generation and a half. We are NATO. So that is a straw man. Then they talk about it expanding and starting World War III. I heard the Vice President make that statement. That is blatantly false. It will not expand. The testimony that we have heard in the Committee on National Security clearly shows that that will not happen. I yield to the gentleman from Indiana. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Let me just say that I remember when the other side, when we were in Vietnam, and they were talking about the domino theory, they pooh-poohed that. Of course, now the same people who are doing that are saying, oh, my gosh, this may be a world war. The fact of the matter is, this war is not going to spread unless everybody decides that they want to let it spread. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. Is it not ironic that the very same people during the Vietnam war that were protesting in the streets and on campuses across this country were saying, we cannot be the world's policeman. These are the same people, 30 years later, who are saying, let us sacrifice young Americans because it will make us feel good about ourselves. The fact of the matter is, there is no vital American interest. The Secretary of Defense admitted as much, and it was in Time magazine, that there is not a vital American interest. But what is disturbing to me is, now we are seeing people saying, well, maybe, since we are beyond the cold war, maybe we do not need a vital American interest. I hear that we have a volunteer army. You notice that is what they are saying. It is a volunteer army, they signed up for this, so we can send them off. It does not matter whether there is a vital American interest, and we spend all of this money on the military, so let us use our military. That is obscene. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, it is. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. That is why I thank the gentleman from California and the gentleman from Indiana for talking about the harsh realities of war. Does it mean that Americans are gun-shy and that we do not believe that any American troops should ever be sent into harm's way? No. But is it asking too much to say, let there be a vital American interest so when the President of the United States picks up the phone and calls a parent and says, your son was just blown apart in Bosnia, but he did it for a good reason. He did it because, and that is where they start to fade out. Because, maybe the NATO people will feel better because we have sacrificed, had human sacrifices in Bosnia. I do not want to trivialize this point, but it is so central to this argument, we have to define what a vital American interest is. We have head the Secretary of Defense, we have heard the Secretary of State, we have heard General Shalikashvili, we have heard a lot of good military men and women come before our Committee on National Security, and all have failed to state that vital American interest. I do not fault them; I fault the Commander in Chief. Mr. DORNAN. Let my good colleague from Florida pause for a moment while I show the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Burton] and the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Scarborough] another photograph, and a series of photographs starting on the cover of Paris Match magazine that you are not going to forget. I guarantee you that you will be bringing this up at town hall meetings. First of all, I hand to Mr. Burton a picture from a war that has great personal significance for me that started in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on June 28, 1914, when a Bosnian Serb murdered Archduke Ferdinand and his wife, Carlotta, the heir to the throne of the Austro- Hungarian empire, and changed Europe for this whole century and began the bloodiest war in its time, 11 million killed, the flower of European youth, and it set us up for World War II where 55 to 60 million died, and it set up Stalin and Lenin and communism where 100 million more died, including China. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. And your dad was there. Mr. DORNAN. I do not have but one studio photograph of my father from World War I. A gentleman called me from North Carolina last fall and said, ``I bought for 100 bucks in a garage sale a bunch of postcards from World War I.'' He asked my staff, ``Does the Congressman have a father who was a lieutenant in World War I?'' Yes. I called him back. Send me the photograph. He sends it, and it is a photograph of my dad with about 15 French children and another young captain. My dad had suffered poison gas, mustard gas twice, shrapnel in his face under his eye, three-wound chevrons turned into Purple Hearts in a ceremony that I witnessed in the Seventh Armory in New York. If my dad were still alive, he went to his reward in 1975 at 83 years of age, he would be saying to me, in the last 4 years of the bloodiest century in all of history, ``We are going back to the hills around Sarajevo where this killing started?'' Now I want to show you both something. I am going to read the text while Dan looks at this and then he gives it to you. I have been on the French Embassy for months to get photographs of the two French pilots in a double seat Mirage 2000 that were shot down while I am at Aviano greeting our pilots back on August 30. They said, ``Uh-oh, we have lost an airplane.'' My heart starts pounding. Is this guy going to be as lucky as young Captain Scott O'Grady? Is he coming down on our side of the line like a British Harrier pilot 2 years earlier? Is he going to come down into Serb hands? Then they come in. I was talking to my wife on the phone. You cannot talk on the phone, but it is a French airplane. We take a two-seater. Then we hear there were good shoots. I am supposed to greet the squadron commander. He bends around in the air, goes back to the tanker and goes back to cover him. On the evening news here you saw their two good parachutes come down. That was August 30. Fifty-two days later, an indicted war criminal indicted at The Hague in the Netherlands by an international war crimes tribunal, Radovan Karadvic, says, ``Oh, the two French pilots were kidnapped from the hospital. What were they doing in a hospital 52 days after? They had good parachutes.'' I am about to show you their pictures the day of capture. The French embassy calls me about Frederique Chiffot, C-H-I-F-F-O-T. I misspelled it when I said it on the floor last. The other one is Souvignet, Jose, J-O-S-E. Let me spell his name, S-O-U-V-I-G-N-E-T. These two pilots are in captivity here. One of them looks like he has a sprained ankle, no cuts on [[Page H 13790]] their faces. The French Foreign Minister thinks that they have been murdered, beaten to death. When Karadzic says they were kidnapped he says, maybe by Moslems; Moslems would not do that, not with the support we are giving them; and he said, or by some band of a rogue brigands for a hostage reward. There has been no asking for money. Look at these pictures. Look at this man's face. The lieutenant, probably the back-seater; well, not necessarily, maybe the captain was the back-seat radar intercept officer. Turn the page. Look at how, like our pilots first captured in Vietnam, he is making this mean grimace into the camera like, I am resisting and I am okay. They are mature men. They are in their mid 30's, you can tell. Why at Dayton, at Wright Patterson, did not somebody say to Milosevic, by the way, all of this is predicated upon the return of these two French allied pilots who are our friends and comrades in arms? The whole deal is off, and here we are on day 82, 30 days after they announced they were kidnapped from a hospital that they should not have been in, and that could be two Americans in a heartbeat. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Bob, it is probably going to be more than two. We are going to have 25,000 there, plus support troops, in that 2\1/2\- mile-wide corridor, and they will be able to attack at any point along that corridor, at any time, day or night, with mortars, land mines, or they can use a terrorist attack with a truck bomb. I am telling you, you are probably going to see, and I hope I am wrong, but you are probably going to see a lot more Americans than two or three. Mr. DORNAN. Look at the faces of the Serb fighters there. How old do you think they are? Mr. BURTON of Indiana. They are probably in their 20's and 30's. Mr. DORNAN. And some in their 40's. Are they tough-looking, warrior- class people? Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Oh, of course. Mr. DORNAN. Have you ever seen tougher looking guys in your life? Mr. SCARBOROUGH. I saw a 60-year-old gentleman in Sarajevo, a Serb, with an assault rifle on the evening news saying, I will kill anybody that comes in here to protect my family. We are getting involved in a three-way civil war that we cannot begin to fathom, the emotions and the hatred. It is just like Mogadishu that you talked about before. We are going even beyond the original U.N. charter where we were only supposed to get involved when the sovereign state was attacked. Why are we putting Americans in the middle of a three-way civil war with what you talked about, war-hardened criminals, for the most part, that will kill Americans as soon as look at them? Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Let me just say something here. Mr. Speaker, this administration has a history of blunders in foreign policy decisions. Haiti, we are now finding out, is costing us hundreds of millions of dollars, and all hell is breaking loose down there. There are a lot of political killings that have been instigated in part by Aristide's own rhetoric. He is now saying he may not leave power, and he is using almost $2 million of American taxpayers' money to lobby Congress for more money. We have Mogadishu and Somalia and the tragedies that occurred there, and now we are going to do the same thing or worse in Bosnia? It makes no sense. This administration needs to get a foreign policy compass. They need to get some direction in their foreign policy, get some experts up there that know what they are doing and know what they are getting us into. Mr. DORNAN. But where was Clinton this morning? Speaking to the British Parliament, instead of over here counseling with us and figuring out how we can contribute to this. Now, let me bounce off of both of you my notes from Clinton's remarks on Monday night. First of all, he did take you on with that first question of yours and me. Because I put 50 questions to him in the Congressional Record just yesterday and put in the Cap Weinberger-Bob Dornan principles, the 10 things that you must satisfy before you put men, and now, thanks to Les Aspin, women, in harm's way. He said, this is Central Europe. It is vital to our national interests. So he used the word. He said so. This House, by a vote of 243 to 171 says no, and it shows you that if there is ever a constitutional power that does not involve the purse, the President can send people anywhere in this world. Wilson asked for a declaration of war. So did Roosevelt. But Harry Truman got into Korea and did not know how to get out and it cost him his Presidency. LBJ, thanks to Kennedy, got into Vietnam, did not know how to extract himself, threw his hands up on March 31, 1968, and said, I am out of here. I will serve out and try and conduct the war. He did not do anything except keep a bombing pause on for all of 1968 that he made even more severe to try and throw the election to Humphrey and destroyed his Presidency. Listen to what Clinton says. They, that is you, Mr. Scarborough, Mr. Burton, and me, and a majority of this House and Senate, they argue America can now step back. As young people would say, excuse me. Step back? We have almost 500 men in Macedonia. We have air power, sea power. We lost that French airplane and lucked out with our American air crew. We threw 90 percent of the strikes that cost those two Frenchmen 82 days of freedom. Please, God, that they are still alive and being moved from village to village. He says, we are going to end the suffering. How much money are we pouring into that area with airlift and sealift? You men should walk through the hospital at Zagreb at the airport. You should look at the U.N. facilities and the U.N. personnel there who are all overpaid, and every nickel they get is tax-free, all the bureaucrats. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Let me just say, he said he is going to end the suffering and we are going to be there 1 year. In 1 year we are going to be in and out, we are going to end the suffering, and this is a civil war, civil strife that has been going on, as you said, for 500 years or more. I am telling you, you are not going to change these people's attitudes, take away their homes and give them to somebody else, solve all of these problems in a year and make this country whole. It is just not going to happen. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. To expand on that briefly, getting back to the testimony we heard from the Committee on National Security, and I am sure you were there. When a retired U.N. general from Canada talked to us about the folly that you were just talking about, about us believing that we can send in one division in 1 year and bring peace to Bosnia for the 21st century, he said that he was responsible for surveying the crimes against humanity, being a monitor for what the Serbs did. One morning he was on the roadside and had to go out and look at a slaughter. The Serbs had slaughtered Moslem children, they had slaughtered women, had slaughtered elderly people. As he was looking at, surveying the scene, a Serb came up to him and he said, well, it serves them right. And the U.N. general turned and said, it serves them right for what? And the Serb responded, it serves them right for what they did to us in 1473. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. In 1473. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. And then the general was silent for a moment, and he looked at the committee. A smile went across his face, and he said, and you Americans believe that you can send in one division for 1 year and make a difference? You are kidding yourselves. You had better stay out. That comes from a man who had been there a lot longer than anybody in the administration and who understands it a lot better than anybody serving in this administration. {time} 1715 Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Let me just say one thing, there is an old statement, ``Those that don't profit from history are destined to make the same mistakes over and over and over again.'' This administration in its foreign policy decisions has not looked at history. They do not have the underpinning, the background necessary to be making these decisions. Yet they are going right ahead, hell-bent for leather, making these decisions, putting our young people in harm's way. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. The irony is, I know this is sort of the electrified [[Page H 13791]] third realm, we do not want to get into it because he is our President, our Commander in Chief. I will just talk about the administration generally. The irony is that the people that are sitting in this administration now are the same people 20 years ago, 30 years ago protesting the Vietnam war. Not only have they not learned from European history, they have not learned the lessons of Vietnam that they taught the country: that unless the American people are solidly behind a military action, and unless there is an immediate vital interest, we do not get involved in other people's civil wars. I thought that is what the Vietnam protests were about. I thought that is what the President and many others in good conscience protested about during the Vietnam war, that this was not our war, that there was not a direct American interest, that America had to leave that civil war to Vietnam. If they wanted to protest that 25, 30 years ago, I am not going to second-guess them or challenge them. That was their right. But why are these same people 30 yeas ago who were telling us that we cannot be policemen of the world and get involved in other people's conflicts, why are these same people, now that they are in charge 30 years later, asking us to do the same exact thing? Mr. DORNAN. Try just 26 years ago, this very week. Clinton himself, ditching class at Oxford, left for Oslo, Stockholm, Helsinki, Leningrad, 2\1/2\ days in Moscow, in Prague, on a tour to help secure victory for Hanoi. It had nothing to do with peace or ending the war in some sort of neutrality respecting the DMZ at the 17th parallel. It was to secure a victory for Hanoi. Here is an article in the current Insight magazine, the one that has Newt on the cover. It says, ``McNamara met the enemy and it turned out to be him.'' On Bosnia, ``There is a chilling McNamara-like rhetoric'' coming from administration people. ``Perry's assertion,'' Secretary of defense Perry, ``is the same guff that McNamara tossed off during Vietnam.'' It says, ``Only industrial strength arrogance can account for Robert Strange McNamara's visit to Hanoi on Veterans Day. The former defense secretary at least is unchanging in the lack of sensibility that characterized his Pentagon tenure during the Vietnam War.'' This is the man, McNamara, that said that we cannot use college men in the Vietnam struggle; they are our future. Clinton told his draft board, ``I'm too educated to go.'' Now we have, just as you pointed out, Joe, the very same people making sure Clinton does not make any reference to Vietnam in his speeches about suffering, I am looking at my notes again from Monday night, he says 250,000 people have been killed. In Cambodia it was 2 million, 8 times that. He says 2 million are on the road. They are alive. Because the road in the South China Sea meant sharks, pirates, and the death of 750,000 people, 68,000 who worked with us executed. And always the one order, the one order from Ho Chi Minh that they pursued even after he died in September 1969 was kill Americans. Are they thinking that when Haitians that we talked about on the docks were jumping up and down and saying, ``We're going to give you Somalia,'' at the end of October, referring to the man who was killed on the 6th, Matt Rearson, they had a dud land at the feet, 5 feet away from a two-star General Garrison. He told me about it himself. The 18 Rangers and helicopter pilots and Delta commandos like Randy Shugart and Gary Gordon, they are yelling about this on the docks of Haiti, 10, 12 days later, and turned around the Norton Sound. Do you not think that these people in Sarajevo who have constant TV, CNN, probably watch some of our C-SPAN debates, are not aware that the key to get Clinton to bug out is Clinton's next words? ``We must expect casualties,'' he said. Of all people, who is he to say that? Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Let me just say on the front page of the New York Times this week they quoted a gentleman from Sarajevo who lives, one of the 60,000 Bosnian Serbs that live around Sarajevo, and he said, ``What you're going to see is what you saw in Somalia when you saw that American dragged through the streets dead.'' Another lady who lives in one of those suburbs said, ``I'll kill myself and my kids before I'll let them take over my home and my property here.'' And those people are going to be coming back. I am telling you, when people say that they will even kill themselves and their kids, what do you think they are going to do to somebody else who tries to take their property? Mr. SCARBOROUGH. If the gentleman will yield, once again drawing comparisons between Bosnia and Vietnam, I remember after the war was over listening to the words of the generals for North Vietnam. They said ``We knew we could not win the war in the jungles of Vietnam, but we knew we would win this war on the streets and the college campuses of America.'' Mr. DORNAN. In the Halls of the Congress. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. ``That is why we kept fighting.'' The same thing is going to happen now. That is why the Weinberger doctrine, which the gentlemen from California [Mr. Dornan] also worked on, that is why one of the key components was support from the American people. We have to have a campaign that Americans support. It is the President's responsibility to step forward and explain what the vital American interest is. Let me just say this. I will tell you this. A lot of people will say, ``Well, why are you all talking about Bosnia in such strident terms,'' and I will tell you, this is my feeling. We have to do it now. It is our responsibility. Because once those young men and women get in Bosnia, at that point I shut my mouth, I follow the Commander in Chief. I will not do what Members of this Congress did in the 1960's and play politics with the lives of American troops. So now is the time that we have to voice our opposition to this, because once the President makes that move, and I can only speak for myself, at that point I believe we as a country fall in line behind the Commander in Chief if he chooses to do that. But until that time comes, I think we need to point out that this is the most misguided foreign policy decision not only that this administration has made but any administration in this country has made since Vietnam. We have to do all we can to draw the line in the sand and tell the President, do not send young Americans. I already have men and women from my district over there. I have NAS Pensacola, Eglin Air Force Base, Hobart Field. I have got a lot of other bases. These are not just the military. It is not abstract terms. We are talking about men and women and the children of people I know, and also my own peers who have children that go to school with my 7-year-old boy in Pensacola, FL, talking about how their father is going to be going to Bosnia. We are talking about killing real people. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Human beings. Real people. The gentleman has said it very well. I do not think anybody could have said it better. The fact of the matter is that I think everybody in this Chamber, once our troops are on the ground, are going to say, ``Hey, we didn't want them there. They shouldn't be there, but they're there and we're going to support our American young men and women who are over there to do a job.'' But the fact of the matter is, I will be supporting our troops, but I certainly will not be supporting this President and this policy that he has adopted because I think it is going to get a lot of them killed. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. What frightens me is this: The fact of the matter is that this has been a very emotional decision by this administration and it has been a decision based, I believe, on emotion. Because I watch TV. I talked about my 7-year-old boy. I saw on ABC News several months back a young 7-year-old Muslim boy was blown off his bicycle, and the boy was screaming and crying, and it looked just like my son. He said, ``Please don't cut off my leg. Don't cut off my leg.'' And the ABC reporter said ``Well, the 7-year-old boy's leg was not cut off but he did die 3 hours later.'' That hit me, and I said I know what the President has to be saying at times. We have got to do something. We have got to stop the killing. That is what my immediate response is, and that is what a lot of Americans think. [[Page H 13792]] But then you step back and you think through this process, and you are not run totally by emotion, and you say, ``Wait a second, it won't be young Bosnians that we are going to be seeing killed and TV 2 months from now, 3 months from now, if we go over there. It is going to be young Americans.'' We better make sure that it is a cause worth dying for, to make sure we do not repeat the same mistakes we made in Somalia, where we made an emotional decision to go over there. Then Americans were slaughtered, drug through the streets. Americans then made an emotional decision to bring them back. Let us not make that mistake again. Let us not base it on emotion. Let us base it on sound foreign policy. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Let me just say one thing about Somalia. When President Bush sent our troops over there initially, it was to feed the hungry masses, and those people welcomed us with open arms and treated our troops very well. It was not until President Clinton made the decision to get into nation-building, which is what he is leading us into in Bosnia, that we started losing troops and ended up having to pull out of there and leaving that dictator Aideed back in power. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. This is what is so frightening. I have heard testimony again before the Committee on National Security and I actually had somebody with a straight face tell me, from the administration, that we needed to go into Bosnia to, quote, reknit the fabric of the Bosnian society, close quote. That, my friend, is extremely frightening. It is extremely naive, and it is going to be young Americans' blood that will be spilled because of that naive view of geopolitical realities. Mr. DORNAN. Mr. Speaker, some of the members of the dynamic freshman class of the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Scarborough] have joined us. I want to put one set of figures into the Record and make one comment, because Clinton at least heeded the warnings of this Congress not to put our men and women under the United Nations. I would ask people to please save their Reader's Digest. I will put this in the Record following our remarks, Dale Van Atta's article commissioned by Reader's Digest on ``The Folly of U.N. Peacekeeping.'' It begins thusly. ``Sonja's Kon-Tiki Cafe is a notorious Serbian watering hole 6 miles north of Sarajevo. While Serb soldiers perpetrated atrocities in all the Bosnian villages, local residents reported that U.N. peacekeepers,'' and it hurts me to read these names, ``from France, Ukraine, Canada, and New Zealand regularly visited Sonja's, drinking and eating with these very same soldiers'' committing the atrocities ``and sharing their women.'' However, the women of Sonja's Kon-Tiki Club were actually prisoners of the Serbs. These are Muslim and Croatian women. ``As one soldier, Borislav Herak, would later confess, he visited Sonja's several times a week, raping many of the 70 females present and killing two of them'' because he felt like it. Then I go down to Haiti and I see white U.N. vehicles, this wonderful dream that grew out of the League of Nations in my father's war, see white U.N. vehicles lined up at the houses of prostitution in Haiti, and wondered why the United Nations is so disrespected. Well, here is what we are doing, and these figures come from the U.N. peacekeeping ops office up in New York. At this time, when Clinton says we are going to pull back, we have 2,267 people in Haiti. I did not know we had 30 in the western Sahara. The gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Burton] is the African expert. I did not know that. The part of Africa that Morocco has taken over. In Macedonia we have 494. When I was there it was 530. We already have 3 in Bosnia, an advance team is arriving as we speak in Tuzla, where that rocket hit on August 28 when I was up in Zagreb, could not believe the imagery on the news that night. We have 361 already in Croatia. I do not know if that includes all the hospital people. We have four in ex-Soviet Georgia. What kind of a Christmas are they going to have? We have 15 still on the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border, and 11 in Jerusalem. Grand total, 3,185. And not spending Christmas with their families will be 17,000 support troops all around Bosnia that are there now, air power, sea power, airlift, sea lift, hospitals, intelligence, more than they know how to use, and Clinton has the gall to say we are pulling back and not helping, and we are going to close out this century with American kids dead in the tinderbox of the Balkans? Let me share some time, and thank you for staying, Dan. I really appreciate it. My wife is calling me all day long, why are you discussing all these mundane things, when for the first time in American history a leader is saying not ``They will be home by Christmas'' but saying ``I think we can have them all in place by Christmas.'' The opposite of MacArthur, of Truman. I have never heard of such a thing in my life. Here is the way I want to allocate some time. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have left on my hour? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Taylor of North Carolina). The gentleman has 13 minutes. Mr. DORNAN. Then let me share this, and let me cut it just a bit, then Steve Chabot of Ohio, I will give you 4 minutes, Steve, because Cynthia McKinney missed her opportunity, and I want all of her people in Georgia waiting for her special order to know she is still here and going to talk about the problem of gerrymandering in Georgia. But, Steve, I will give you 4 minutes, Mark Neumann 4 minutes, Sam Brownback 2 minutes, Mark Sanford of South Carolina 2 minutes, and Jack Metcalf 4 minutes, and that ought to do it. Then on to Cynthia. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Chabot]. {time} 1730 Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank the gentleman for using the French pronunciation of my name, which I do not hear very often. Thank you very much. I have been listening to the arguments and points made by my colleagues here. I think they made some very good, some very persuasive arguments. I would just like to reiterate some of the things they have made and make some new ones myself. First, I think it is important for us to always remember that these people in that very, very dangerous area of the world have been fighting with each other for centuries now, for hundreds of years. They have been battling each other, and, unfortunately, our President is now talking about and pushing forward with a plan which will put young Americans, both men and women, on the ground in Bosnia right in the middle of that bloody mess. I am very concerned that, rather than fighting and shooting at each other, in the very near future they are going to be shooting at Americans, and I hope and I pray that I am wrong. But I am very concerned that many, many Americans are going to come back to the shores of this country in body bags. There are many other dangers besides the snipers and rogue Serbs or rogue folks on either side lobbing mortars, mortar shells, artillery shells into our U.S. troops. There are 6 million mines in Bosnia. Many of those mines, nobody has a clue as to where they are at. People can be out on a routine patrol just walking down the street and could very easily set off a mine, could be mangled and mutilated or killed, and I am very concerned we are going to lost a lot of people to those very lethal instruments. That is the 6 million estimated mines there are throughout the Bosnian area. In addition, I think we really have to recognize that, whereas the Serbs have certainly been the most aggressive and have performed the most atrocious acts and have killed the most innocent people, that none of the parties really have clean hands in this incident. The Moslems, the Bosnian Moslems, and the Croats have also allegedly committed a number of atrocities themselves. All three parties have done some very awful things in the past couple of years in that very, very dangerous part of the world. Certainly, the Serbs have been the worst. In addition, the President is talking about our troops will be out in an estimated 1-year period of time. Again, go back to the point that these people have been fighting for hundreds of years now. How anyone can predict [[Page H 13793]] that our troops will have solved the problems over there, kept the peace and then pulled out in a year's period of time, I think that there is no way in the world that is going to happen. If our troops are pulled out, it is very likely that in a very short period of time the atrocities will start again, the fighting will start, and we are going to have the same type of chaos and death that we have over there now. So the 1-year period of time, I think, is a period of time that has been grabbed out of the air, and some would argue that it has to do with the fact that there is an election a year down the road. Who knows why the President picked 1 year. But I do not think there is any way we are going to be able to go over there and then suddenly peace is going to break out in that very dangerous part of the world after we have been there for a 1-year period of time. This is in Europe's backyard. It is very, very difficult for anybody to make the argument that this is in the vital interests of the United States. We have an interest to the extent that I think we think it was a good idea for the President to get the parties together. I think it is appropriate for us to play a role in getting people to talk about peace. I think we can play a role in supporting the Europeans through our air power, which we are able to project without great loss of life to American citizens. But I do not think that a legitimate argument can be made that it is necessary for U.S. troops to be at risk on the ground, and it does not take very long for anybody to pick out a couple of examples of the type of things which could very well happen in the very near future in that very dangerous part of the world. Look what happened in Lebanon. You know, it was something as unsophisticated as a truck filled with explosives to blow up a building and kill over 200 United States Marines in Beirut, Lebanon. In Somalia we went in with the best of intentions to feed people, and then mission creep set in. The goal got expanded. We were trying to build democracies over there. We got in the middle of the warlords. Our helicopters got shot down. American lives were lost, and the bodies of young Americans were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu. What we are trying to do here is to prevent the President from making a very, very tragic mistake. He certainly has not convinced me that this is in the vital interests of the United States to put United States troops on the ground in Bosnia. From the calls that I am receiving in my office every day, he certainly has not convinced the people of Cincinnati, the people that I represent, that this is the right action. The calls are overwhelmingly coming in that we should not put United States troops on the ground in Bosnia. I have talked to many, many of my colleagues here on both sides of the aisle, both Democrats and Republicans, and the calls are coming in from people all over this country, ``Don't do it. Don't put United States troops on the ground in Bosnia.'' The President apparently is determined to move ahead with this venture. I think he is making a terrible mistake. I wish he would listen to Congress, and I wish he would listen to the American people and, please, prevent this tragedy from happening. We do not need to lose American lives in Bosnia. I beg the President to reconsider this effort that he seems to be determined to make. I think it is a very tragic event. I hope I am wrong. I hope and pray that my concerns are unfounded and things will go well. But I am very, very concerned that I am right, and if that happens, we are going to have many, many Americans who lose their lives in that very dangerous part of the world. Mr. DORNAN. I thank the gentleman for his excellent remarks. I yield to the gentleman from Washington [Mr. Metcalf]. Mr. METCALF. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I just want to start out by saying this is under no circumstances a partisan issue. It makes no difference whatsoever and would not ever make a difference to me whether the President was Republican or Democrat on this kind of an issue. I listened really carefully to President Clinton's' speech, and I re- read the speech word for word just so I was certain what he said. The vital United States interests the President laid out in his speech were broad, universal interests and would apply to any trouble spot in the world. This is not satisfactory. I have said since I ran for Congress that I would support committing American troops only if vital, specific U.S. interests were involved, and the interests that he gave were not. Militarily, U.S. troops are not needed. Our own Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff stated that Europe can handle the military aspect themselves. European powers have direct interest in Bosnia, and they should step up to the plate on this. Britain and France have done so and will be part of the operation as it is planned. You know, it is interesting, Germany had not pledged troops until today. I guess Germany remembers World War II, when they occupied that area for several years during World War II. They understand the problems there of an occupying nation, and it just seems to me that maybe their reason for not joining until today is that they understood better than we do some of the problems that are involved. The President promised that the troops in Haiti would be home in a year. Remember? It has now been 16 months, and the troops are still there. Why should we believe that Bosnia is different? One of the things that the President did say was he said he would provide a clear mission statement, a specific operational plan, what are the objectives, how will these troops accomplish the objectives, and what is the exit strategy. Thus far, and he said he would present that, and I assume that that is still coming. I am not being critical at all. We just do not have it yet. We certainly need it before we can make the judgment as to whether or not troops should be sent. Also we do not have the money to engage this operation. That is another very critical factor. We fight and work very hard to cut $2 million here or $12 million there from the budget. The estimate of the cost of this is $2.1 billion at the present time. Judging from all previous estimates that I have seen, you should multiply it at least by 2, so we are talking about, I believe, close to a $4 billion cost. Remember, this is money that we do not have. This is money that will have to be borrowed if we move into Bosnia. The idea of balancing the budget is absolutely critical, and there are circumstances certainly where we would go ahead and even if we had to borrow the money, but only if we are certain of what is going to happen, what is the vital U.S. interest that is involved, what is the plan to actually achieve the kind of peace we are looking for and set up the conditions by which we can exit. Those are the points that I see, and we will try to have an open mind and watch what the President comes up with for these things. As of now, from what I have seen, my vote would be an absolute ``no.'' I certainly hope and will do everything I can to see that we do get a vote on this in the House of Representatives. I think the Senate should also vote on whether or not to authorize troops, ground troops in Bosnia. Mr. DORNAN. I say to the gentleman from Washington [Mr. Metcalf], I want to recommend a book to you on Mogadishu. On the cover is the picture of Durand's helicopter crew, the ones that were killed, Ray Frank, three full combat tours in Vietnam, big, handsome, blond David Cleveland, William, his mother called him David, the men called him William, like his father. He was one of the door gunners, and Tommy Fields, another door gunner. It is just called ``Mogadishu.'' It tells a story of a tragedy in the Clinton administration that he just put behind him. Let me ask you something, I say to the gentleman from Washington [Mr. Metcalf], there is a report from my district office today. The calls dropped to 100 for the first time. It is usually 200. Not a single person calling my district office, oh, they will call now, detractors and stuff. We are going to ignore their calls, and I have every right to be as tough as I want on this because I am the one who went to Mogadishu less than 10 days after the last man was killed there, to photograph this whole area. They are saying 100 calls a day in my office without one saying ``Go; we should go.'' [[Page H 13794]] How are they in your office from the great Pacific Northwest? Mr. METCALF. Our calls are running more than 30 to 1 against sending troops to Bosnia, and there comes a time certainly that you should listen to the American people. Mr. DORNAN. I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. Sanford]. Mr. SANFORD. I do not know how much more actually can be added between my colleague, the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Scarborough], my colleague, the gentleman from California [Mr. Dornan], and the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Burton], go down the list, and therefore I mean you have touched on this idea of 200 American men, best-case scenario, dying. You have touched on the idea of spending $1.5 billion. You have touched on the idea we do not have a clearly defined exit strategy. You touched on the idea of 37,000 American boys being directly involved. Mr. DORNAN. I have run out of time. We did not give you gentlemen enough heads-up over here. The documents referred to are as follows: [From the Reader's Digest, October 1995] The Folly of U.N. Peacekeeping (By Dale Van Atta) Sonja's Kon-Tiki cafe is a notorious Serbian watering hole six miles north of Sarajevo. While Serb soldiers perpetrated atrocities in nearby Bosnian villages, local residents reported that U.N. peacekeepers from France, Ukraine, Canada and New Zealand regularly visited Sonja's, drinking and eating with these very same soldiers--and sharing their women. The women of Sonja's, however, were actually prisoners of the Serb soldiers. As one soldier, Borislav Herak, would later confess, he visited Sonja's several times a week, raping some of the 70 females present and killing two of them. U.N. soldiers patronized Sonja's even after a Sarajevo newspaper reported where the women were coming from. Asked about this, a U.N. spokesman excused the incident by saying no one was assigned to read the newspaper. The U.N. soldiers who frequented Sonja's also neglected to check out the neighborhood. Less than 200 feet away, a concentration camp held Bosnian Muslims in inhuman conditions. Of 800 inmates processed, 250 disappeared and are presumed dead. Tragically, Sonja's Kon-Tiki illustrates much of what has plagued U.N. peacekeeping operations: incompetent commanders, undisciplined soldiers, alliances with aggressors, failure to prevent atrocities and at times even contributing to the horror. And the level of waste, fraud and abuse is overwhelming. Until recently, the U.N. rarely intervened in conflicts. When it did, as in Cyprus during the 1960s and '70s, it had its share of success. But as the Cold War ended, the U.N. became the world's policeman, dedicated to nation building as well as peacekeeping. By the end of 1991, the U.N. was conducting 11 peacekeeping operations at an annual cost of $480 million. In three years, the numbers rose to 18 operations and $3.3 billion--with U.S. taxpayers paying 31.7 percent of the bill. Have the results justified the steep cost? Consider the U.N.'s top four peacekeeping missions: bosnia In June 1991, Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia and was recognized by the U.N. The Serbian- dominated Yugoslav army invaded Croatia, ostensibly to protect its Serbian minority. After the Serbs agreed to a cease-fire, the U.N. sent in a 14,000-member U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to build a new nation. (The mission has since mushroomed to more than 40,000 personnel, becoming the most extensive and expensive peacekeeping operation ever.) After neighboring Bosnia declared its independence in March 1992, the Serbs launched a savage campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' against the Muslims and Croats who made up 61 percent of the country's population. Rapidly the Serbs gained control of two-thirds of Bosnia, which they still hold. Bosnian Serbs swept into Muslim and Croat villages and engaged in Europe's worst atrocities since the Nazi Holocaust. Serbian thugs raped at least 20,000 women and girls. In barbed-wire camps, men, women and children were tortured and starved to death. Girls as young as six were raped repeatedly while parents and siblings were forced to watch. In one case, three Muslim girls were chained to a fence, raped by Serb soldiers for three days, then drenched with gasoline and set on fire. While this was happening, the UNPROFOR troops stood by and did nothing to help. Designated military ``observers'' counted artillery shells--and the dead. Meanwhile, evidence began to accumulate that there was a serious corruption problem. Accounting procedures were so loose that the U.S. overpaid $1.8 million on a $21.8 million fuel contract. Kenyan peacekeepers stole 25,000 gallons of fuel worth $100,000 and sold it to the Serbs. Corruption charges were routinely dismissed as unimportant by U.N. officials. Sylvana Foa, then spokesperson for the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva, said it was no surprise that ``out of 14,000 pimply 18-year-olds, a bunch of them should get up to hanky-panky'' like black-market dealings and going to brothels. When reports persisted, the U.N. finally investigated. In November 1993 a special commission confirmed that some terrible but ``limited'' misdeeds had occurred. Four Kenyan and 19 Ukrainian solders were dismissed from the U.N. force. The commission found no wrong-doing at Sonja's Kon-Tiki, but its report, locked up at U.N. headquarters and never publicly released, is woefully incomplete. The Sonja's Kon- Tiki incidents were not fully investigated, for example, because the Serbs didn't allow U.N. investigators to visit the site, and the soldiers' daily logbooks had been destroyed. Meanwhile, Russian troop commanders have collaborated with the Serb aggressors. According to U.N. personnel at the scene, Russian battalion commander Col. Viktor Loginov and senior officer Col. Aleksandr Khromchenkov frequented lavish feasts hosted by a Serbian warlord known as ``Arkan,'' widely regarded as one of the worst perpetrators of atrocities. It was also common knowledge that Russian officers directed U.N. tankers to unload gas at Arkan's barracks. During one cease- fire, when Serbian materiel was locked in a U.N. storage area, a Russian apparently gave the keys to the Serbs, who removed 51 tanks. Eventually, Khromchenkov was repatriated. Loginov, after finishing his tour of duty, joined Arkan's Serbian forces. Problems remained, however, under the leadership of another Russian commander, Maj. Gen. Aleksandr Perelyakin. Belgian troops had been blocking the movement of Serb troops across a bridge in northeastern Croatia, as required by U.N. Security Council resolutions. Perelyakin ordered the Belgians to stand aside. Reluctantly they did so, permitting one of the largest movements of Serbian troops and equipment into the region since the 1991 cease-fire. According to internal U.N. reports, the U.N. spent eight months quietly trying to pressure Moscow to pull Perelyakin back, but the Russians refused. The U.N. finally dismissed him last April. cambodia In 1991, the United States, China and the Soviet Union helped broker a peace treaty among three Cambodian guerrilla factions and the Vietnamese-installed Cambodian government, ending 21 years of civil war. To ease the transition to Cambodia's first democratic government, the U.N. created the U.N. Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). In less than two years, about 20,000 U.N. peacekeepers and other personnel were dispatched at a cost of $1.9 billion. Some of the Cambodian ``peacekeepers'' proved to be unwelcome guests--especially a Bulgarian battalion dubbed the ``Vulgarians.'' In northwest Cambodia, three Bulgarian soldiers were killed for ``meddling'' with local girls. One Bulgarian was treated for 17 different cases of VD. The troops' frequent carousing once sparked a mortar-rifle battle with Cambodian soldiers at a brothel. The Bulgarians were not the sole miscreants in Cambodia, as internal U.N. audits later showed. Requests from Phnom Penh included 6500 flak jackets--and 300,000 condoms. In the year after the U.N. peacekeepers arrived, the number of prostitutes in Phnom Penh more than tripled. U.N. mission chief Yasushi Akashi waved off Cambodian complaints with a remark that ``18-year-old hot-blooded soldiers'' had the right to enjoy themselves, drink a few beers and chase ``young beautiful beings.'' He did post an order: ``Please do not park your U.N. vans near the nightclubs'' (i.e., whorehouses). At least 150 U.N. peacekeepers contracted AIDS in Cambodia; 5000 of the troops came down with VD. Meanwhile, more than 1000 generators were ordered, at least 330 of which, worth nearly $3.2 million, were never used for the mission. When U.N. personnel started spending the $234.5 million budgeted for ``premises and accommodation,'' rental costs became so inflated that natives could barely afford to live in their own country. Some $80 million was spent buying vehicles, including hundreds of surplus motorcycles and minibuses. When 100 12-seater minibuses were needed, 850 were purchased--an ``administrative error,'' UNTAC explained, that cost $8.3 million. Despite the excesses, the U.N. points with pride to the free election that UNTAC sponsored in May 1993. Ninety percent of Cambodia's 4.7 million eligible voters defied death threats from guerrilla groups and went to the polls. Unfortunately, the election results have been subverted by the continued rule of the Cambodian People's Party--the Vietnamese-installed Communist government, which lost at the ballot box. In addition, the Khmer Rouge--the guerrilla group that butchered more than a million countrymen in the 1970s-- have refused to disarm and demobilize. So it was predictable that they would repeatedly break the ceasefire and keep up their killing. The U.N. has spent nearly $2 billion, but there is no peace in Cambodia. somalia When civil war broke out in this African nation, the resulting anarchy threatened 4.5 million Somalis--over half the population--with severe malnutrition and related diseases. U.N. Secretary General Boutros [[Page H 13795]] Boutros Ghali, the first African (and Arab) to hold the position, argued eloquently for a U.N. peacekeeping mission to ensure safe delivery of food and emergency supplies. The U.N. Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) was deployed to Mogadishu, the capital, in September 1992. It was quickly pinned down at the airport by Somali militiamen and was unable to complete its mission. A U.S. task force deployed in December secured the Mogadishu area, getting supplies to the hungry and ill. After the Americans left, the U.N. took over in May 1993 with UNOSOM II. The $2-million-a-day operation turned the former U.S. embassy complex into an 80-acre walled city boasting air-conditioned housing and a golf course. When U.N. officials ventured out of the compound, their ``taxis'' were helicopters that cost $500,000 a week. The published commercial rate for Mogadishu-U.S. phone calls was $4.91 a minute, but the ``special U.N. discount rate'' was $8.41. Unauthorized personal calls totaled more than $2 million, but the U.N. simply picked up the tab and never asked the callers to pay. Meanwhile, the peacekeeping effort disintegrated, particularly as warlord Mohammed Aidid harassed UNOSOM II troops. As the civil war continued, Somalis starved. But U.N. peacekeepers--on a food budget of $56 million a year--dined on fruit from South America, beef from Australia from frozen fish from New Zealand and the Netherlands. Thousands of yards of barbed wire arrived with no barbs; hundreds of light fixtures to illuminate the streets abutting the compound had no sockets for light bulbs. What procurement didn't waste, pilferage often took care of. Peacekeeping vehicles disappeared with regularity, and Egyptian U.N. troops were suspected of large scale black-marketing of minibuses. These losses, however, were eclipsed in a single night by an enterprising thief who broke into a U.N. office in Mogadishu and made off with $3.9 million in cash. The office door was easy pickings: its lock could be jimmied with a credit card. The money, stored in the bottom drawer of a filing cabinet, had been easily visible to dozens of U.N. employees. While the case has not been solved, one administrator was dismissed and two others were disciplined. Last summer, UNOSOM II itself was shut down, leaving Somalia to the same clan warfare that existed when U.N. troops were first deployed two years before. RWANDA Since achieving independence in 1962, Rwanda has erupted in violence between the majority Hutu tribe and minority Tutsis. The U.N. had a peacekeeping mission in that nation, but it fled as the Hutus launched a new bloodbath in April 1994. Only 270 U.N. troops stayed behind, not enough to prevent the butchery of at least 14 local Red Cross workers left exposed by the peacekeepers' swift flight. The U.N. Security Council dawdled as the dead piled up, and a daily horror of shooting, stabbings and machete hackings. The Hutus were finally driven out by a Tutsi rebel army in late summer 1994. Seven U.N. agencies and more than 100 international relief agencies rushed back. With a budget of some $200 million, the U.N. tried unsuccessfully to provide security over Hutu refugee camps in Rwanda and aid to camps in neighboring Zaire. The relief effort was soon corrupted when the U.N. let the very murderers who'd massacred a half million people take over the camps. Rather than seeking their arrest and prosecution, the U.N. made deals with the Hutu thugs, who parlayed U.N. food, drugs and other supplies into millions of dollars on the black market. Earlier this year the U.N. began to pull out of the camps. On April 22 at the Kibeho camp in Rwanda, the Tutsi-led military opened fire on Hutu crowds. Some 2000 Hutus were massacred. Where was the U.N.? Overwhelmed by the presence of nearly 2000 Tutsi soldiers, the 200 U.N. peacekeepers did nothing. A U.N. spokesman told Reader's Digest, meekly, that the U.N. was on the scene after the slaughter for cleanup and body burial. With peacekeeping operations now costing over $3 billion a year, reform is long overdue. Financial accountability can be established only by limiting control by the Secretariat, which routinely withholds information about peacekeeping operations until the last minute--too late for the U.N.'s budgetary committee to exercise oversight. In December 1993, for example, when the budget committee was given one day to approve a $600-million budget that would extend peacekeeping efforts into 1994, U.S. representative Michael Michalski lodged an official protest: ``If U.S. government employees approved a budget for a similar amount with as little information as has been provided to the committee, they would likely be thrown in jail.'' More fundamentally, the U.N. needs to re-examine its whole peacekeeping approach, for the experiment in nation building has been bloody and full of failure. Lofty ideas to bring peace everywhere in the world have run aground on reality: member states with competing interests in warring territories, the impossibility of lightly armed troops keeping at bay belligerent enemies, and the folly of moving into places without setting achievable goals. ``It has been a fundamental error to put U.N. peacekeepers in place where there is no peace to keep,'' says Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), ranking minority member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``We've seen very vividly that the U.N. is not equipped, organized or financed to intervene and fight wars.'' ____ [From the Paris Match, Oct. 5, 1995] Our Pilots are Prisoners of the Serbs (Translated by David Skelly) Two tiny points in an incandescent sky. These images have been holding us in cruel suspense for nearly a month. The two points are two French officers, a captain pilot and a lieutenant navigator, shot down on August 30 in their Mirage 2000-K2, almost directly above Pale, the capital of the Bosnian Serbs, during the first NATO raid. Three exfiltration missions according to the CSAR (combat, search and rescue procedure), which had succeeded in rescuing Captain O'Grady, failed. The Serbs have confirmed that they are holding two men alive, but no one, not even the Red Cross envoys has actually seen them. These photos reached us from Pale. Here are the faces of the two prisoners whom France has been anxiously waiting to see. The first scenes of their captivity. Peasants turned the lieutenant over to the `special forces commandos'. Being helped to walk by two Serbs from their special forces, Lieutenant Jose Souvignet seems to be suffering from a leg wound. Peasants turned the two airmen over to the ``specijali,'' who have been hiding them from the whole world ever since. The captain, Frederique Chiffot, snarls at his guards. Contrary to what happened with the American pilot, ours were brought down in broad daylight, above a mountain in an area with a high density of Serbian soldiers. Militiamen in the city of Pale were able to be there when they came down, and so it was impossible for the Frenchmen to escape. As soon as they hit ground they were captured and stripped of their warning, location, and survival equipment. Since these unique photos were taken, probably very shortly after their capture (in the foreground, a militiaman is still holding their helmets), they have probably been moved from their place of captivity, making it very difficult to exfiltrate them. According to rare Serbian information, it was thought that only Lieutenant Jose Souvignet had a leg wound. But here, Captain Frederique Chiffot, grimacing at the camera, also seems to be supported by members of the militia. Three attempts already: NATO is doing everything possible to free them. From September 5th to the 8th, three times over, NATO commandos have flown off in search of the two Frenchmen. These very complicated missions make use of airplanes and helicopters which have taken off from different bases, from Italian territory or the aircraft carrier ``Theodore Roosevelt.'' On board this ship, the Admiral Smith's general staff is coordinating, second by second, the delicate precision engineering of this warriors' ballet. The first attempt was completely American, but the weather was not on our side. The second and third attempts were French and American. Only the latter enabled the commandos to set down on a meadow near Pale. In vain. They had to withdraw under fire from the Serbs before having found the prisoners. When they were taken back up in the helicopter, two had been wounded. In the control room of the ``Theodore Roosevelt'' operations are being followed in real time. It was in an identical Mirage 2000 that the two pilots were brought down. Photos of the debris from the crash were widely disseminated in the press by the Serbs.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of May 12, 1995, the gentleman from California [Mr. Dornan] is recognized for 60 minutes. Mr. DORNAN. I did not realize your time was wrapping up, Mr. Burton. I just wanted to, in a colloquy with you, underscore what you said about the targeting of Americans by people from outside Bosnia. The MOIS, the secret police of Iran, have people in all the areas in Bosnia and around there. They are the security for shipping arms to the Moslem Bosnians through Zagreb with the complicity, the tolerance of the Croatian Government, all the way up to President Franjo Tudjman. They have targeted Americans for over a year. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. And they are having Americans killed, you might add. Mr. DORNAN. Yes. Now here is what adds a dimension to this today. Someone who has told me who I trust--now this makes it hearsay and puts it in the category of rumor for our friends in the dominant media culture. The liberals will go wild here, but a meeting took place at the White House, all the key players from Defense and from the State Department and security agencies, and Clinton himself expressed concern and asked many questions about the mujaheddin from Iran, the bad mujaheddin, just like we had good and bad in Afghanistan--the Hamas, some of the groups you have named, and the secret police, the terrorist secret police of Iran. He asked about them targeting Americans. He has known about this for a year. {time} 1645 The President is purported to have said, looking at Leon Panetta, my classmate from 1976, ``Do not let the Congress get fired up on this. Downplay this when you talk to the Congressmen and the Senators.'' In other words, instead of telling the American people the danger that we are in, and, to quote his own words which I will do in a minute, he is asking them to downplay the threat to our Americans. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. If the gentleman will continue to yield, the fact of the matter is we know there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Moslem terrorists from Iran who are in the Bosnia area right now. We do not know how many. We have no idea. The fact of the matter is that some of those people were involved in such tragedies here in America as the World Trade Center bombing. They do not like our policies, they do not like America very much. When you put troops, American troops strung out between, say, Sarajevo and Tuzla, that long corridor 2\1/2\ miles wide, you are leaving them open for an attack anyplace among that line. That means that you are probably going to have, anyplace along that corridor for Sarajevo to Tuzla that there could be a bomber, there could be a mortar attack, there could be any kind of attack on our troops and they will not know when it is coming. I remember when President Clinton had a number of us in the White House when we were in Mogadishu, in Somalia. The President came up with a new policy. He said he was going to billet our troops on the tarmac at the airport there in Mogadishu. He said they would be safe. They would be there as a security measure, but they would not be involved in any combat or other operations. This was after we started nation building, we quit the food handling over there. Two days later the Aideed forces, the terrorist tribal leader over there, lobbed mortars into the exact spot where our soldiers were going to be billeted. That was not anything like Bosnia, yet if we had had troops in that area where the President said they were going to be, and they found out about it, there would have been many of them killed. Think about that when you talk about a corridor between Sarajevo and Tuzla, 2\1/2\ miles wide with 25,000 American troops in there. They could pick any spot along there, any time day or night, attack our troops and kill hundreds, maybe thousands of them. This is a recipe for disaster. I appreciate the gentleman for yielding to me. The President should reconsider, and he should come clean with the American people. If he said what you alleged he said to Leon Panetta, you know, we do not let the Congress get into this thing, then he should be taken to task. I do not know if he said it or not. The American people need to know the risks. There are going to be young women lose their legs, their arms, their eyes from these land mines, but even a greater risk is the possibility of a terrorist attack from possibly Bosnian Serbs who are going to be upset about losing their homes and the problems around Sarajevo, or possibly Moslem terrorist from Iran. There are a number of people who do not like what is going on over there. They do not like anybody very much. I think our troops are really at risk. It is a mistake to get into this quagmire. Mr. DORNAN. Dan, stay with me just a minute here, because I have been to Central America with you several times, we have both been to Haiti and been very concerned about what is happening there. We both have taken a personal interest in the calls that are coming into our offices from families of men who are in active duty in Germany and who resented Clinton referring to them as volunteers. One mother said to one of my staffers, My son is not a French legionnaire or a mercenary, he did not join the military to fight under any flag, he joined and took an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And he did take a follow-on order that we do not take as Congressmen Newt would like this probably at this point, that we will obey all lawful orders of our commander. But it is coming down to the word ``lawful.'' Because you suffered through Mogadishu and spoke so forcefully and eloquently on the floor, I want to share something with you. When I was in my thirties I produced my own TV show. We had, the year I started, just gotten state-of-the-art close-up lenses where we could go in on an ant on the set and fill someone's television screen at home with that ant. Here we are, 27 years later, since I first started in December of 1967 28 years later, and we cannot call for a close-up with these good Americans down in the control room a couple of floors below us, and it is too bad. I think the day is going to come, just like some day we will have color in the Congressional Record. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I would like for them to see this map. Mr. DORNAN. If they can see this Posavina corridor that we are supposed to widen by the Dayton-Wright Patterson treaty, widen and enforce---- Mr. BURTON of Indiana. If the Americans could see the corridor we are supposed to try to defend---- Mr. DORNAN. Hold that steady and maybe the camera here in the southeast corner of the House could come in, point with your finger---- Mr. BURTON of Indiana. It is going to run all the way this way. Mr. DORNAN. Take it from there at the top. The little pink strip there, between the part of Serb-held Bosnia that is against Milosevic's Bosnia-Serbia proper and Montenegro, and this huge glob in the northern part of what is Bosnia, this little, tiny Posavina corridor, 2\1/2\ miles, is supposed to be expanded to five. Keep in mind the Israelis were properly always exercised about the distance from the furthest west point of the West Bank, Judea, from Natanya, by the sea, was 18 miles. They say that is an artillery-lobbed shell. This is 2\1/2\. Our men---- Mr. BURTON of Indiana. You have been in the military you might tell our [[Page H 13788]] colleagues how far a mortar will go, how far they can stay back from that 2\1/2\-mile-wide corridor to hit American troops if they wanted to lob something in there. Mr. DORNAN. The mortars that hit the marketplace in Tuzla when I was in Zagreb the 28th of August, and threw bodies every which way, killed 60 or 70 people and maimed 150; when I look at that ``maimed,'' I always think ``Who is blind? Who has no legs there? Who lost all their fingers there?'' We always put the death toll in bigger caps than the maimed. That is lives changed forever. A person will never earn the same income. Those mortars could be 5 or 10 miles from the corridor and lob these shells into the corridor. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. The point is they could get within a half a mile and be more accurately targeted in. That is the problem. Mr. DORNAN. I wish almost, like in every television show, we had a monitor buried in the table here so we could see. I don't know how close they can come in on this picture, but I am going to walk over there and give it to you so you can look at this handsome young American soldier's face, First Sergeant Randall Shughart. I visited his grave 2 weeks ago in Carlisle, PA. His parents sent me this picture because they did not like the standard Army picture. They said, ``This is more what Randy looked like when he was helping us on the farm.'' I am sure that as close as they can get, it is just a color picture of a handsome young fellow with a closely cropped beard and a cowboy hat, in his barn. Take a look at this while I tell you this story. Randy Shughart, together with Gary Gordon, begged the headquarters at Mogadishu International Airport to let them go down and disembark from their helicopter, because they could see movement in the cockpit of Michael Durant's crashed Blackhawk helicopter. Three times they were told no. They were, in a sense, because they knew the odds, begging to die for their friends. St. John the Evangelist 15:13, ``Greater love no man has than he died for his friends.'' They saved Durant. Durant hugging me, and both of us crying, told me that he owes his life to Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon. All four men had spine injuries when that helicopter made a hard landing. The helicopter that he disembarked took a direct hit of a rocket-propelled grenade and blew out one of the door posts and tore the leg right off one of the door gunners. I talked to the young Corporal Hall who jumped in and took over the door gun, and they flew back to Newport and crashed the helicopter, totaling it out. So that day we lost Wolcott's helicopter, Cliff Wolcott, killing him and his pilot, and then we lost this one, Durant's, and then we lost that one to a total accident after they were out of it. They held off for about 30 minutes. I have asked the Army for their last transcriptions. Durant told me the last thing Gordon or Shughart said to him was ``Good luck, pal. I hope you make it.'' Went around the front of the helicopter, heard him take a couple of shots, heard him grunt with pain. Hopefully they died with the rifle shots as the crowd overwhelmed the helicopter and captured Durant. Durant told me another man was lying on the ground, and I will not give his name because of his parents, and he was taken alive with Durant. They beat him to death. Then they began to so abuse their bodies that now that it is 2 years and 2 months later, a former Congressman said to me tonight, ``Congressman, these men are owned by America. Why don't you tell the country what happened to them?'' I will not, but I will go further than I have ever gone before. These five men, including the two that won the Medal of Honor and including Randy Shughart's picture you have there, they did not just mutilate their bodies and drag them through the streets and stick rifles and poles into every bodily orifice, including their mouths, and have women and children dance upon them in the streets for Canadian Broadcasting, the guy won a Pulitzer Prize for his video and film coverage, Paul something, they cut their arms off the bodies. We never got those limbs back. They dumped their burned remains on the steps of the United Nation every 2 days until we had gotten back---- Mr. BURTON of Indiana. If I may interrupt, that was never reported to the American people? Mr. DORNAN. Never. Look at Randy's handsome face, and he was born in Lincoln, NE. I showed this to our Medal of Honor winner, the Senator from Nebraska, Bob Kerrey, and he started at him intently, and I said, ``This guy is from Lincoln.'' And he said, ``Are you sure?'' and I said yes, I thought he was buried there. And then the Army told me where, so I went to his grave, because the week before when I was at a presidential forum in Bangor, ME, and I had asked where the other Lincoln was, in Lincoln, ME, where Gary Gordon is from. ``Two Young Men from Lincoln'' is the story I would like to write. They said, ``50 minutes north of here,'' and I took my son and drove up this first week of November to Gary Gordon's grave. I said to Mark, ``I want to see Randy Shughart's grave.'' His dad, that man there, his father is the one who refused to shake Clinton's hand in the East Ballroom of the White House, and Bob Kerrey, Senator, told me he was at this ceremony and remembers it vividly. I said, ``How is it Bob, the press never reported that story, that it only came out on talk radio?'' Mr. Shughart, a basic American farmer type, retired in Carlisle near his son's grave. He told me that he said to Clinton, ``Why did you fly Aideed down to Addis Abbaba days after this people killed and multilated my son's body?'' Mr. BURTON of Indiana. He was the dictator and tribal terrorist over there that was responsible for that. Mr. DORNAN. Another Fidel Castro, another General Jopp, another Aristide, the same mold, all of them. He said Clinton told him, ``I did not know about that operation.'' Mr. BURTON of Indiana. If the gentleman will yield, that is a ludicrous statement for anybody to make, because the administration had their Ambassador over there, negotiating with Aideed during a lot of this stuff that was going on. They knew entirely, from intelligence sources, what was going on. It is absolutely unbelievable that they would make a statement like that. Let me just add one more thing. Mr. DORNAN. It is Clinton making the statement to the father of a dead, murdered, Medal of Honor winner. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I just cannot believe that is the case. The President said in his speech---- Mr. DORNAN. He meant the operation, taking Aideed down to Addis Abbaba. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. The President said, ``I take full responsibility for whatever might happen over there.'' The fact of the matter is he should take full responsibility for what happened in Mogadishu to those men who got killed. They did not send proper equipment there, they did not send M-1 A-1 tanks, they did not send Bradley armored vehicles. He knew they should have sent those over there. The men trapped there, they did not get to them in that little town for 40 or 50 minutes because they could not get through the crowds. Mr. DORNAN. Eleven and one-half hours before they relieved the Rangers. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. The fact of the matter is we lost some of those men because we did not get there quick enough. Mr. DORNAN. Four or five died during the night. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. The fact of the matter is we are going to lose more young men and women, many more times, 40 or 50 more times in Bosnia. I think the President is making a terrible mistake. Mr. SCARBBOROUGH. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. DORNAN. I yield to the gentleman from Florida. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. I thank the gentleman from California for yielding, and thank him for all of his service on the Committee on National Security, where we have worked together. I certainly appreciate the comments you have made about the horrible treatment that American soldiers have to go through, and humanizing this process. Let me tell you something that really has disturbed me during this debate. There have been three falsehoods. The first is that we should blindly fall in line behind our Commander in Chief, regardless of what he suggests. We [[Page H 13789]] should send out troops, whether we know if there is a vital American interest, a time line, or all of the things we need to make this successful. I remember back in the mid-1990's, before I was in Congress, and you were here, maybe you can expand on this in a minute or two, just to remind Americans that there can be a loyal opposition. I remember when we were trying to remove Communists, when Ronald Reagan was trying to remove Communists from Central America, there were actually Members of this body that wrote Communist leader Ortega in Nicaragua and apologized for our support of the freedom fighters. These same people tell us that we cannot even debate this openly, so America can decide whether they want young American men and women killed in Bosnia? Let us make no mistake of it, we have sat through the briefings on the Committee on National Security. Everybody that comes in says, ``Young Americans will die if they go to Bosnia and get involved in a civil war that has been raging for over 500 years.'' What have we kept asking? We have kept saying, ``What is the vital American interest?'' {time} 1700 They have set up straw men and tried to knock them down, saying that if we did not get involved that somehow our credibility in NATO would be greatly diminished. That is a joke. The fact of the matter is, we are NATO. We have protected NATO countries for a generation from the threat of communism, and we will continue. Mr. DORNAN. A generation and a half. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. A generation and a half. We are NATO. So that is a straw man. Then they talk about it expanding and starting World War III. I heard the Vice President make that statement. That is blatantly false. It will not expand. The testimony that we have heard in the Committee on National Security clearly shows that that will not happen. I yield to the gentleman from Indiana. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Let me just say that I remember when the other side, when we were in Vietnam, and they were talking about the domino theory, they pooh-poohed that. Of course, now the same people who are doing that are saying, oh, my gosh, this may be a world war. The fact of the matter is, this war is not going to spread unless everybody decides that they want to let it spread. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. Is it not ironic that the very same people during the Vietnam war that were protesting in the streets and on campuses across this country were saying, we cannot be the world's policeman. These are the same people, 30 years later, who are saying, let us sacrifice young Americans because it will make us feel good about ourselves. The fact of the matter is, there is no vital American interest. The Secretary of Defense admitted as much, and it was in Time magazine, that there is not a vital American interest. But what is disturbing to me is, now we are seeing people saying, well, maybe, since we are beyond the cold war, maybe we do not need a vital American interest. I hear that we have a volunteer army. You notice that is what they are saying. It is a volunteer army, they signed up for this, so we can send them off. It does not matter whether there is a vital American interest, and we spend all of this money on the military, so let us use our military. That is obscene. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, it is. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. That is why I thank the gentleman from California and the gentleman from Indiana for talking about the harsh realities of war. Does it mean that Americans are gun-shy and that we do not believe that any American troops should ever be sent into harm's way? No. But is it asking too much to say, let there be a vital American interest so when the President of the United States picks up the phone and calls a parent and says, your son was just blown apart in Bosnia, but he did it for a good reason. He did it because, and that is where they start to fade out. Because, maybe the NATO people will feel better because we have sacrificed, had human sacrifices in Bosnia. I do not want to trivialize this point, but it is so central to this argument, we have to define what a vital American interest is. We have head the Secretary of Defense, we have heard the Secretary of State, we have heard General Shalikashvili, we have heard a lot of good military men and women come before our Committee on National Security, and all have failed to state that vital American interest. I do not fault them; I fault the Commander in Chief. Mr. DORNAN. Let my good colleague from Florida pause for a moment while I show the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Burton] and the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Scarborough] another photograph, and a series of photographs starting on the cover of Paris Match magazine that you are not going to forget. I guarantee you that you will be bringing this up at town hall meetings. First of all, I hand to Mr. Burton a picture from a war that has great personal significance for me that started in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on June 28, 1914, when a Bosnian Serb murdered Archduke Ferdinand and his wife, Carlotta, the heir to the throne of the Austro- Hungarian empire, and changed Europe for this whole century and began the bloodiest war in its time, 11 million killed, the flower of European youth, and it set us up for World War II where 55 to 60 million died, and it set up Stalin and Lenin and communism where 100 million more died, including China. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. And your dad was there. Mr. DORNAN. I do not have but one studio photograph of my father from World War I. A gentleman called me from North Carolina last fall and said, ``I bought for 100 bucks in a garage sale a bunch of postcards from World War I.'' He asked my staff, ``Does the Congressman have a father who was a lieutenant in World War I?'' Yes. I called him back. Send me the photograph. He sends it, and it is a photograph of my dad with about 15 French children and another young captain. My dad had suffered poison gas, mustard gas twice, shrapnel in his face under his eye, three-wound chevrons turned into Purple Hearts in a ceremony that I witnessed in the Seventh Armory in New York. If my dad were still alive, he went to his reward in 1975 at 83 years of age, he would be saying to me, in the last 4 years of the bloodiest century in all of history, ``We are going back to the hills around Sarajevo where this killing started?'' Now I want to show you both something. I am going to read the text while Dan looks at this and then he gives it to you. I have been on the French Embassy for months to get photographs of the two French pilots in a double seat Mirage 2000 that were shot down while I am at Aviano greeting our pilots back on August 30. They said, ``Uh-oh, we have lost an airplane.'' My heart starts pounding. Is this guy going to be as lucky as young Captain Scott O'Grady? Is he coming down on our side of the line like a British Harrier pilot 2 years earlier? Is he going to come down into Serb hands? Then they come in. I was talking to my wife on the phone. You cannot talk on the phone, but it is a French airplane. We take a two-seater. Then we hear there were good shoots. I am supposed to greet the squadron commander. He bends around in the air, goes back to the tanker and goes back to cover him. On the evening news here you saw their two good parachutes come down. That was August 30. Fifty-two days later, an indicted war criminal indicted at The Hague in the Netherlands by an international war crimes tribunal, Radovan Karadvic, says, ``Oh, the two French pilots were kidnapped from the hospital. What were they doing in a hospital 52 days after? They had good parachutes.'' I am about to show you their pictures the day of capture. The French embassy calls me about Frederique Chiffot, C-H-I-F-F-O-T. I misspelled it when I said it on the floor last. The other one is Souvignet, Jose, J-O-S-E. Let me spell his name, S-O-U-V-I-G-N-E-T. These two pilots are in captivity here. One of them looks like he has a sprained ankle, no cuts on [[Page H 13790]] their faces. The French Foreign Minister thinks that they have been murdered, beaten to death. When Karadzic says they were kidnapped he says, maybe by Moslems; Moslems would not do that, not with the support we are giving them; and he said, or by some band of a rogue brigands for a hostage reward. There has been no asking for money. Look at these pictures. Look at this man's face. The lieutenant, probably the back-seater; well, not necessarily, maybe the captain was the back-seat radar intercept officer. Turn the page. Look at how, like our pilots first captured in Vietnam, he is making this mean grimace into the camera like, I am resisting and I am okay. They are mature men. They are in their mid 30's, you can tell. Why at Dayton, at Wright Patterson, did not somebody say to Milosevic, by the way, all of this is predicated upon the return of these two French allied pilots who are our friends and comrades in arms? The whole deal is off, and here we are on day 82, 30 days after they announced they were kidnapped from a hospital that they should not have been in, and that could be two Americans in a heartbeat. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Bob, it is probably going to be more than two. We are going to have 25,000 there, plus support troops, in that 2\1/2\- mile-wide corridor, and they will be able to attack at any point along that corridor, at any time, day or night, with mortars, land mines, or they can use a terrorist attack with a truck bomb. I am telling you, you are probably going to see, and I hope I am wrong, but you are probably going to see a lot more Americans than two or three. Mr. DORNAN. Look at the faces of the Serb fighters there. How old do you think they are? Mr. BURTON of Indiana. They are probably in their 20's and 30's. Mr. DORNAN. And some in their 40's. Are they tough-looking, warrior- class people? Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Oh, of course. Mr. DORNAN. Have you ever seen tougher looking guys in your life? Mr. SCARBOROUGH. I saw a 60-year-old gentleman in Sarajevo, a Serb, with an assault rifle on the evening news saying, I will kill anybody that comes in here to protect my family. We are getting involved in a three-way civil war that we cannot begin to fathom, the emotions and the hatred. It is just like Mogadishu that you talked about before. We are going even beyond the original U.N. charter where we were only supposed to get involved when the sovereign state was attacked. Why are we putting Americans in the middle of a three-way civil war with what you talked about, war-hardened criminals, for the most part, that will kill Americans as soon as look at them? Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Let me just say something here. Mr. Speaker, this administration has a history of blunders in foreign policy decisions. Haiti, we are now finding out, is costing us hundreds of millions of dollars, and all hell is breaking loose down there. There are a lot of political killings that have been instigated in part by Aristide's own rhetoric. He is now saying he may not leave power, and he is using almost $2 million of American taxpayers' money to lobby Congress for more money. We have Mogadishu and Somalia and the tragedies that occurred there, and now we are going to do the same thing or worse in Bosnia? It makes no sense. This administration needs to get a foreign policy compass. They need to get some direction in their foreign policy, get some experts up there that know what they are doing and know what they are getting us into. Mr. DORNAN. But where was Clinton this morning? Speaking to the British Parliament, instead of over here counseling with us and figuring out how we can contribute to this. Now, let me bounce off of both of you my notes from Clinton's remarks on Monday night. First of all, he did take you on with that first question of yours and me. Because I put 50 questions to him in the Congressional Record just yesterday and put in the Cap Weinberger-Bob Dornan principles, the 10 things that you must satisfy before you put men, and now, thanks to Les Aspin, women, in harm's way. He said, this is Central Europe. It is vital to our national interests. So he used the word. He said so. This House, by a vote of 243 to 171 says no, and it shows you that if there is ever a constitutional power that does not involve the purse, the President can send people anywhere in this world. Wilson asked for a declaration of war. So did Roosevelt. But Harry Truman got into Korea and did not know how to get out and it cost him his Presidency. LBJ, thanks to Kennedy, got into Vietnam, did not know how to extract himself, threw his hands up on March 31, 1968, and said, I am out of here. I will serve out and try and conduct the war. He did not do anything except keep a bombing pause on for all of 1968 that he made even more severe to try and throw the election to Humphrey and destroyed his Presidency. Listen to what Clinton says. They, that is you, Mr. Scarborough, Mr. Burton, and me, and a majority of this House and Senate, they argue America can now step back. As young people would say, excuse me. Step back? We have almost 500 men in Macedonia. We have air power, sea power. We lost that French airplane and lucked out with our American air crew. We threw 90 percent of the strikes that cost those two Frenchmen 82 days of freedom. Please, God, that they are still alive and being moved from village to village. He says, we are going to end the suffering. How much money are we pouring into that area with airlift and sealift? You men should walk through the hospital at Zagreb at the airport. You should look at the U.N. facilities and the U.N. personnel there who are all overpaid, and every nickel they get is tax-free, all the bureaucrats. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Let me just say, he said he is going to end the suffering and we are going to be there 1 year. In 1 year we are going to be in and out, we are going to end the suffering, and this is a civil war, civil strife that has been going on, as you said, for 500 years or more. I am telling you, you are not going to change these people's attitudes, take away their homes and give them to somebody else, solve all of these problems in a year and make this country whole. It is just not going to happen. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. To expand on that briefly, getting back to the testimony we heard from the Committee on National Security, and I am sure you were there. When a retired U.N. general from Canada talked to us about the folly that you were just talking about, about us believing that we can send in one division in 1 year and bring peace to Bosnia for the 21st century, he said that he was responsible for surveying the crimes against humanity, being a monitor for what the Serbs did. One morning he was on the roadside and had to go out and look at a slaughter. The Serbs had slaughtered Moslem children, they had slaughtered women, had slaughtered elderly people. As he was looking at, surveying the scene, a Serb came up to him and he said, well, it serves them right. And the U.N. general turned and said, it serves them right for what? And the Serb responded, it serves them right for what they did to us in 1473. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. In 1473. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. And then the general was silent for a moment, and he looked at the committee. A smile went across his face, and he said, and you Americans believe that you can send in one division for 1 year and make a difference? You are kidding yourselves. You had better stay out. That comes from a man who had been there a lot longer than anybody in the administration and who understands it a lot better than anybody serving in this administration. {time} 1715 Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Let me just say one thing, there is an old statement, ``Those that don't profit from history are destined to make the same mistakes over and over and over again.'' This administration in its foreign policy decisions has not looked at history. They do not have the underpinning, the background necessary to be making these decisions. Yet they are going right ahead, hell-bent for leather, making these decisions, putting our young people in harm's way. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. The irony is, I know this is sort of the electrified [[Page H 13791]] third realm, we do not want to get into it because he is our President, our Commander in Chief. I will just talk about the administration generally. The irony is that the people that are sitting in this administration now are the same people 20 years ago, 30 years ago protesting the Vietnam war. Not only have they not learned from European history, they have not learned the lessons of Vietnam that they taught the country: that unless the American people are solidly behind a military action, and unless there is an immediate vital interest, we do not get involved in other people's civil wars. I thought that is what the Vietnam protests were about. I thought that is what the President and many others in good conscience protested about during the Vietnam war, that this was not our war, that there was not a direct American interest, that America had to leave that civil war to Vietnam. If they wanted to protest that 25, 30 years ago, I am not going to second-guess them or challenge them. That was their right. But why are these same people 30 yeas ago who were telling us that we cannot be policemen of the world and get involved in other people's conflicts, why are these same people, now that they are in charge 30 years later, asking us to do the same exact thing? Mr. DORNAN. Try just 26 years ago, this very week. Clinton himself, ditching class at Oxford, left for Oslo, Stockholm, Helsinki, Leningrad, 2\1/2\ days in Moscow, in Prague, on a tour to help secure victory for Hanoi. It had nothing to do with peace or ending the war in some sort of neutrality respecting the DMZ at the 17th parallel. It was to secure a victory for Hanoi. Here is an article in the current Insight magazine, the one that has Newt on the cover. It says, ``McNamara met the enemy and it turned out to be him.'' On Bosnia, ``There is a chilling McNamara-like rhetoric'' coming from administration people. ``Perry's assertion,'' Secretary of defense Perry, ``is the same guff that McNamara tossed off during Vietnam.'' It says, ``Only industrial strength arrogance can account for Robert Strange McNamara's visit to Hanoi on Veterans Day. The former defense secretary at least is unchanging in the lack of sensibility that characterized his Pentagon tenure during the Vietnam War.'' This is the man, McNamara, that said that we cannot use college men in the Vietnam struggle; they are our future. Clinton told his draft board, ``I'm too educated to go.'' Now we have, just as you pointed out, Joe, the very same people making sure Clinton does not make any reference to Vietnam in his speeches about suffering, I am looking at my notes again from Monday night, he says 250,000 people have been killed. In Cambodia it was 2 million, 8 times that. He says 2 million are on the road. They are alive. Because the road in the South China Sea meant sharks, pirates, and the death of 750,000 people, 68,000 who worked with us executed. And always the one order, the one order from Ho Chi Minh that they pursued even after he died in September 1969 was kill Americans. Are they thinking that when Haitians that we talked about on the docks were jumping up and down and saying, ``We're going to give you Somalia,'' at the end of October, referring to the man who was killed on the 6th, Matt Rearson, they had a dud land at the feet, 5 feet away from a two-star General Garrison. He told me about it himself. The 18 Rangers and helicopter pilots and Delta commandos like Randy Shugart and Gary Gordon, they are yelling about this on the docks of Haiti, 10, 12 days later, and turned around the Norton Sound. Do you not think that these people in Sarajevo who have constant TV, CNN, probably watch some of our C-SPAN debates, are not aware that the key to get Clinton to bug out is Clinton's next words? ``We must expect casualties,'' he said. Of all people, who is he to say that? Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Let me just say on the front page of the New York Times this week they quoted a gentleman from Sarajevo who lives, one of the 60,000 Bosnian Serbs that live around Sarajevo, and he said, ``What you're going to see is what you saw in Somalia when you saw that American dragged through the streets dead.'' Another lady who lives in one of those suburbs said, ``I'll kill myself and my kids before I'll let them take over my home and my property here.'' And those people are going to be coming back. I am telling you, when people say that they will even kill themselves and their kids, what do you think they are going to do to somebody else who tries to take their property? Mr. SCARBOROUGH. If the gentleman will yield, once again drawing comparisons between Bosnia and Vietnam, I remember after the war was over listening to the words of the generals for North Vietnam. They said ``We knew we could not win the war in the jungles of Vietnam, but we knew we would win this war on the streets and the college campuses of America.'' Mr. DORNAN. In the Halls of the Congress. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. ``That is why we kept fighting.'' The same thing is going to happen now. That is why the Weinberger doctrine, which the gentlemen from California [Mr. Dornan] also worked on, that is why one of the key components was support from the American people. We have to have a campaign that Americans support. It is the President's responsibility to step forward and explain what the vital American interest is. Let me just say this. I will tell you this. A lot of people will say, ``Well, why are you all talking about Bosnia in such strident terms,'' and I will tell you, this is my feeling. We have to do it now. It is our responsibility. Because once those young men and women get in Bosnia, at that point I shut my mouth, I follow the Commander in Chief. I will not do what Members of this Congress did in the 1960's and play politics with the lives of American troops. So now is the time that we have to voice our opposition to this, because once the President makes that move, and I can only speak for myself, at that point I believe we as a country fall in line behind the Commander in Chief if he chooses to do that. But until that time comes, I think we need to point out that this is the most misguided foreign policy decision not only that this administration has made but any administration in this country has made since Vietnam. We have to do all we can to draw the line in the sand and tell the President, do not send young Americans. I already have men and women from my district over there. I have NAS Pensacola, Eglin Air Force Base, Hobart Field. I have got a lot of other bases. These are not just the military. It is not abstract terms. We are talking about men and women and the children of people I know, and also my own peers who have children that go to school with my 7-year-old boy in Pensacola, FL, talking about how their father is going to be going to Bosnia. We are talking about killing real people. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Human beings. Real people. The gentleman has said it very well. I do not think anybody could have said it better. The fact of the matter is that I think everybody in this Chamber, once our troops are on the ground, are going to say, ``Hey, we didn't want them there. They shouldn't be there, but they're there and we're going to support our American young men and women who are over there to do a job.'' But the fact of the matter is, I will be supporting our troops, but I certainly will not be supporting this President and this policy that he has adopted because I think it is going to get a lot of them killed. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. What frightens me is this: The fact of the matter is that this has been a very emotional decision by this administration and it has been a decision based, I believe, on emotion. Because I watch TV. I talked about my 7-year-old boy. I saw on ABC News several months back a young 7-year-old Muslim boy was blown off his bicycle, and the boy was screaming and crying, and it looked just like my son. He said, ``Please don't cut off my leg. Don't cut off my leg.'' And the ABC reporter said ``Well, the 7-year-old boy's leg was not cut off but he did die 3 hours later.'' That hit me, and I said I know what the President has to be saying at times. We have got to do something. We have got to stop the killing. That is what my immediate response is, and that is what a lot of Americans think. [[Page H 13792]] But then you step back and you think through this process, and you are not run totally by emotion, and you say, ``Wait a second, it won't be young Bosnians that we are going to be seeing killed and TV 2 months from now, 3 months from now, if we go over there. It is going to be young Americans.'' We better make sure that it is a cause worth dying for, to make sure we do not repeat the same mistakes we made in Somalia, where we made an emotional decision to go over there. Then Americans were slaughtered, drug through the streets. Americans then made an emotional decision to bring them back. Let us not make that mistake again. Let us not base it on emotion. Let us base it on sound foreign policy. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Let me just say one thing about Somalia. When President Bush sent our troops over there initially, it was to feed the hungry masses, and those people welcomed us with open arms and treated our troops very well. It was not until President Clinton made the decision to get into nation-building, which is what he is leading us into in Bosnia, that we started losing troops and ended up having to pull out of there and leaving that dictator Aideed back in power. Mr. SCARBOROUGH. This is what is so frightening. I have heard testimony again before the Committee on National Security and I actually had somebody with a straight face tell me, from the administration, that we needed to go into Bosnia to, quote, reknit the fabric of the Bosnian society, close quote. That, my friend, is extremely frightening. It is extremely naive, and it is going to be young Americans' blood that will be spilled because of that naive view of geopolitical realities. Mr. DORNAN. Mr. Speaker, some of the members of the dynamic freshman class of the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Scarborough] have joined us. I want to put one set of figures into the Record and make one comment, because Clinton at least heeded the warnings of this Congress not to put our men and women under the United Nations. I would ask people to please save their Reader's Digest. I will put this in the Record following our remarks, Dale Van Atta's article commissioned by Reader's Digest on ``The Folly of U.N. Peacekeeping.'' It begins thusly. ``Sonja's Kon-Tiki Cafe is a notorious Serbian watering hole 6 miles north of Sarajevo. While Serb soldiers perpetrated atrocities in all the Bosnian villages, local residents reported that U.N. peacekeepers,'' and it hurts me to read these names, ``from France, Ukraine, Canada, and New Zealand regularly visited Sonja's, drinking and eating with these very same soldiers'' committing the atrocities ``and sharing their women.'' However, the women of Sonja's Kon-Tiki Club were actually prisoners of the Serbs. These are Muslim and Croatian women. ``As one soldier, Borislav Herak, would later confess, he visited Sonja's several times a week, raping many of the 70 females present and killing two of them'' because he felt like it. Then I go down to Haiti and I see white U.N. vehicles, this wonderful dream that grew out of the League of Nations in my father's war, see white U.N. vehicles lined up at the houses of prostitution in Haiti, and wondered why the United Nations is so disrespected. Well, here is what we are doing, and these figures come from the U.N. peacekeeping ops office up in New York. At this time, when Clinton says we are going to pull back, we have 2,267 people in Haiti. I did not know we had 30 in the western Sahara. The gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Burton] is the African expert. I did not know that. The part of Africa that Morocco has taken over. In Macedonia we have 494. When I was there it was 530. We already have 3 in Bosnia, an advance team is arriving as we speak in Tuzla, where that rocket hit on August 28 when I was up in Zagreb, could not believe the imagery on the news that night. We have 361 already in Croatia. I do not know if that includes all the hospital people. We have four in ex-Soviet Georgia. What kind of a Christmas are they going to have? We have 15 still on the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border, and 11 in Jerusalem. Grand total, 3,185. And not spending Christmas with their families will be 17,000 support troops all around Bosnia that are there now, air power, sea power, airlift, sea lift, hospitals, intelligence, more than they know how to use, and Clinton has the gall to say we are pulling back and not helping, and we are going to close out this century with American kids dead in the tinderbox of the Balkans? Let me share some time, and thank you for staying, Dan. I really appreciate it. My wife is calling me all day long, why are you discussing all these mundane things, when for the first time in American history a leader is saying not ``They will be home by Christmas'' but saying ``I think we can have them all in place by Christmas.'' The opposite of MacArthur, of Truman. I have never heard of such a thing in my life. Here is the way I want to allocate some time. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have left on my hour? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Taylor of North Carolina). The gentleman has 13 minutes. Mr. DORNAN. Then let me share this, and let me cut it just a bit, then Steve Chabot of Ohio, I will give you 4 minutes, Steve, because Cynthia McKinney missed her opportunity, and I want all of her people in Georgia waiting for her special order to know she is still here and going to talk about the problem of gerrymandering in Georgia. But, Steve, I will give you 4 minutes, Mark Neumann 4 minutes, Sam Brownback 2 minutes, Mark Sanford of South Carolina 2 minutes, and Jack Metcalf 4 minutes, and that ought to do it. Then on to Cynthia. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Chabot]. {time} 1730 Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank the gentleman for using the French pronunciation of my name, which I do not hear very often. Thank you very much. I have been listening to the arguments and points made by my colleagues here. I think they made some very good, some very persuasive arguments. I would just like to reiterate some of the things they have made and make some new ones myself. First, I think it is important for us to always remember that these people in that very, very dangerous area of the world have been fighting with each other for centuries now, for hundreds of years. They have been battling each other, and, unfortunately, our President is now talking about and pushing forward with a plan which will put young Americans, both men and women, on the ground in Bosnia right in the middle of that bloody mess. I am very concerned that, rather than fighting and shooting at each other, in the very near future they are going to be shooting at Americans, and I hope and I pray that I am wrong. But I am very concerned that many, many Americans are going to come back to the shores of this country in body bags. There are many other dangers besides the snipers and rogue Serbs or rogue folks on either side lobbing mortars, mortar shells, artillery shells into our U.S. troops. There are 6 million mines in Bosnia. Many of those mines, nobody has a clue as to where they are at. People can be out on a routine patrol just walking down the street and could very easily set off a mine, could be mangled and mutilated or killed, and I am very concerned we are going to lost a lot of people to those very lethal instruments. That is the 6 million estimated mines there are throughout the Bosnian area. In addition, I think we really have to recognize that, whereas the Serbs have certainly been the most aggressive and have performed the most atrocious acts and have killed the most innocent people, that none of the parties really have clean hands in this incident. The Moslems, the Bosnian Moslems, and the Croats have also allegedly committed a number of atrocities themselves. All three parties have done some very awful things in the past couple of years in that very, very dangerous part of the world. Certainly, the Serbs have been the worst. In addition, the President is talking about our troops will be out in an estimated 1-year period of time. Again, go back to the point that these people have been fighting for hundreds of years now. How anyone can predict [[Page H 13793]] that our troops will have solved the problems over there, kept the peace and then pulled out in a year's period of time, I think that there is no way in the world that is going to happen. If our troops are pulled out, it is very likely that in a very short period of time the atrocities will start again, the fighting will start, and we are going to have the same type of chaos and death that we have over there now. So the 1-year period of time, I think, is a period of time that has been grabbed out of the air, and some would argue that it has to do with the fact that there is an election a year down the road. Who knows why the President picked 1 year. But I do not think there is any way we are going to be able to go over there and then suddenly peace is going to break out in that very dangerous part of the world after we have been there for a 1-year period of time. This is in Europe's backyard. It is very, very difficult for anybody to make the argument that this is in the vital interests of the United States. We have an interest to the extent that I think we think it was a good idea for the President to get the parties together. I think it is appropriate for us to play a role in getting people to talk about peace. I think we can play a role in supporting the Europeans through our air power, which we are able to project without great loss of life to American citizens. But I do not think that a legitimate argument can be made that it is necessary for U.S. troops to be at risk on the ground, and it does not take very long for anybody to pick out a couple of examples of the type of things which could very well happen in the very near future in that very dangerous part of the world. Look what happened in Lebanon. You know, it was something as unsophisticated as a truck filled with explosives to blow up a building and kill over 200 United States Marines in Beirut, Lebanon. In Somalia we went in with the best of intentions to feed people, and then mission creep set in. The goal got expanded. We were trying to build democracies over there. We got in the middle of the warlords. Our helicopters got shot down. American lives were lost, and the bodies of young Americans were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu. What we are trying to do here is to prevent the President from making a very, very tragic mistake. He certainly has not convinced me that this is in the vital interests of the United States to put United States troops on the ground in Bosnia. From the calls that I am receiving in my office every day, he certainly has not convinced the people of Cincinnati, the people that I represent, that this is the right action. The calls are overwhelmingly coming in that we should not put United States troops on the ground in Bosnia. I have talked to many, many of my colleagues here on both sides of the aisle, both Democrats and Republicans, and the calls are coming in from people all over this country, ``Don't do it. Don't put United States troops on the ground in Bosnia.'' The President apparently is determined to move ahead with this venture. I think he is making a terrible mistake. I wish he would listen to Congress, and I wish he would listen to the American people and, please, prevent this tragedy from happening. We do not need to lose American lives in Bosnia. I beg the President to reconsider this effort that he seems to be determined to make. I think it is a very tragic event. I hope I am wrong. I hope and pray that my concerns are unfounded and things will go well. But I am very, very concerned that I am right, and if that happens, we are going to have many, many Americans who lose their lives in that very dangerous part of the world. Mr. DORNAN. I thank the gentleman for his excellent remarks. I yield to the gentleman from Washington [Mr. Metcalf]. Mr. METCALF. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I just want to start out by saying this is under no circumstances a partisan issue. It makes no difference whatsoever and would not ever make a difference to me whether the President was Republican or Democrat on this kind of an issue. I listened really carefully to President Clinton's' speech, and I re- read the speech word for word just so I was certain what he said. The vital United States interests the President laid out in his speech were broad, universal interests and would apply to any trouble spot in the world. This is not satisfactory. I have said since I ran for Congress that I would support committing American troops only if vital, specific U.S. interests were involved, and the interests that he gave were not. Militarily, U.S. troops are not needed. Our own Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff stated that Europe can handle the military aspect themselves. European powers have direct interest in Bosnia, and they should step up to the plate on this. Britain and France have done so and will be part of the operation as it is planned. You know, it is interesting, Germany had not pledged troops until today. I guess Germany remembers World War II, when they occupied that area for several years during World War II. They understand the problems there of an occupying nation, and it just seems to me that maybe their reason for not joining until today is that they understood better than we do some of the problems that are involved. The President promised that the troops in Haiti would be home in a year. Remember? It has now been 16 months, and the troops are still there. Why should we believe that Bosnia is different? One of the things that the President did say was he said he would provide a clear mission statement, a specific operational plan, what are the objectives, how will these troops accomplish the objectives, and what is the exit strategy. Thus far, and he said he would present that, and I assume that that is still coming. I am not being critical at all. We just do not have it yet. We certainly need it before we can make the judgment as to whether or not troops should be sent. Also we do not have the money to engage this operation. That is another very critical factor. We fight and work very hard to cut $2 million here or $12 million there from the budget. The estimate of the cost of this is $2.1 billion at the present time. Judging from all previous estimates that I have seen, you should multiply it at least by 2, so we are talking about, I believe, close to a $4 billion cost. Remember, this is money that we do not have. This is money that will have to be borrowed if we move into Bosnia. The idea of balancing the budget is absolutely critical, and there are circumstances certainly where we would go ahead and even if we had to borrow the money, but only if we are certain of what is going to happen, what is the vital U.S. interest that is involved, what is the plan to actually achieve the kind of peace we are looking for and set up the conditions by which we can exit. Those are the points that I see, and we will try to have an open mind and watch what the President comes up with for these things. As of now, from what I have seen, my vote would be an absolute ``no.'' I certainly hope and will do everything I can to see that we do get a vote on this in the House of Representatives. I think the Senate should also vote on whether or not to authorize troops, ground troops in Bosnia. Mr. DORNAN. I say to the gentleman from Washington [Mr. Metcalf], I want to recommend a book to you on Mogadishu. On the cover is the picture of Durand's helicopter crew, the ones that were killed, Ray Frank, three full combat tours in Vietnam, big, handsome, blond David Cleveland, William, his mother called him David, the men called him William, like his father. He was one of the door gunners, and Tommy Fields, another door gunner. It is just called ``Mogadishu.'' It tells a story of a tragedy in the Clinton administration that he just put behind him. Let me ask you something, I say to the gentleman from Washington [Mr. Metcalf], there is a report from my district office today. The calls dropped to 100 for the first time. It is usually 200. Not a single person calling my district office, oh, they will call now, detractors and stuff. We are going to ignore their calls, and I have every right to be as tough as I want on this because I am the one who went to Mogadishu less than 10 days after the last man was killed there, to photograph this whole area. They are saying 100 calls a day in my office without one saying ``Go; we should go.'' [[Page H 13794]] How are they in your office from the great Pacific Northwest? Mr. METCALF. Our calls are running more than 30 to 1 against sending troops to Bosnia, and there comes a time certainly that you should listen to the American people. Mr. DORNAN. I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. Sanford]. Mr. SANFORD. I do not know how much more actually can be added between my colleague, the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Scarborough], my colleague, the gentleman from California [Mr. Dornan], and the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Burton], go down the list, and therefore I mean you have touched on this idea of 200 American men, best-case scenario, dying. You have touched on the idea of spending $1.5 billion. You have touched on the idea we do not have a clearly defined exit strategy. You touched on the idea of 37,000 American boys being directly involved. Mr. DORNAN. I have run out of time. We did not give you gentlemen enough heads-up over here. The documents referred to are as follows: [From the Reader's Digest, October 1995] The Folly of U.N. Peacekeeping (By Dale Van Atta) Sonja's Kon-Tiki cafe is a notorious Serbian watering hole six miles north of Sarajevo. While Serb soldiers perpetrated atrocities in nearby Bosnian villages, local residents reported that U.N. peacekeepers from France, Ukraine, Canada and New Zealand regularly visited Sonja's, drinking and eating with these very same soldiers--and sharing their women. The women of Sonja's, however, were actually prisoners of the Serb soldiers. As one soldier, Borislav Herak, would later confess, he visited Sonja's several times a week, raping some of the 70 females present and killing two of them. U.N. soldiers patronized Sonja's even after a Sarajevo newspaper reported where the women were coming from. Asked about this, a U.N. spokesman excused the incident by saying no one was assigned to read the newspaper. The U.N. soldiers who frequented Sonja's also neglected to check out the neighborhood. Less than 200 feet away, a concentration camp held Bosnian Muslims in inhuman conditions. Of 800 inmates processed, 250 disappeared and are presumed dead. Tragically, Sonja's Kon-Tiki illustrates much of what has plagued U.N. peacekeeping operations: incompetent commanders, undisciplined soldiers, alliances with aggressors, failure to prevent atrocities and at times even contributing to the horror. And the level of waste, fraud and abuse is overwhelming. Until recently, the U.N. rarely intervened in conflicts. When it did, as in Cyprus during the 1960s and '70s, it had its share of success. But as the Cold War ended, the U.N. became the world's policeman, dedicated to nation building as well as peacekeeping. By the end of 1991, the U.N. was conducting 11 peacekeeping operations at an annual cost of $480 million. In three years, the numbers rose to 18 operations and $3.3 billion--with U.S. taxpayers paying 31.7 percent of the bill. Have the results justified the steep cost? Consider the U.N.'s top four peacekeeping missions: bosnia In June 1991, Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia and was recognized by the U.N. The Serbian- dominated Yugoslav army invaded Croatia, ostensibly to protect its Serbian minority. After the Serbs agreed to a cease-fire, the U.N. sent in a 14,000-member U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to build a new nation. (The mission has since mushroomed to more than 40,000 personnel, becoming the most extensive and expensive peacekeeping operation ever.) After neighboring Bosnia declared its independence in March 1992, the Serbs launched a savage campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' against the Muslims and Croats who made up 61 percent of the country's population. Rapidly the Serbs gained control of two-thirds of Bosnia, which they still hold. Bosnian Serbs swept into Muslim and Croat villages and engaged in Europe's worst atrocities since the Nazi Holocaust. Serbian thugs raped at least 20,000 women and girls. In barbed-wire camps, men, women and children were tortured and starved to death. Girls as young as six were raped repeatedly while parents and siblings were forced to watch. In one case, three Muslim girls were chained to a fence, raped by Serb soldiers for three days, then drenched with gasoline and set on fire. While this was happening, the UNPROFOR troops stood by and did nothing to help. Designated military ``observers'' counted artillery shells--and the dead. Meanwhile, evidence began to accumulate that there was a serious corruption problem. Accounting procedures were so loose that the U.S. overpaid $1.8 million on a $21.8 million fuel contract. Kenyan peacekeepers stole 25,000 gallons of fuel worth $100,000 and sold it to the Serbs. Corruption charges were routinely dismissed as unimportant by U.N. officials. Sylvana Foa, then spokesperson for the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva, said it was no surprise that ``out of 14,000 pimply 18-year-olds, a bunch of them should get up to hanky-panky'' like black-market dealings and going to brothels. When reports persisted, the U.N. finally investigated. In November 1993 a special commission confirmed that some terrible but ``limited'' misdeeds had occurred. Four Kenyan and 19 Ukrainian solders were dismissed from the U.N. force. The commission found no wrong-doing at Sonja's Kon-Tiki, but its report, locked up at U.N. headquarters and never publicly released, is woefully incomplete. The Sonja's Kon- Tiki incidents were not fully investigated, for example, because the Serbs didn't allow U.N. investigators to visit the site, and the soldiers' daily logbooks had been destroyed. Meanwhile, Russian troop commanders have collaborated with the Serb aggressors. According to U.N. personnel at the scene, Russian battalion commander Col. Viktor Loginov and senior officer Col. Aleksandr Khromchenkov frequented lavish feasts hosted by a Serbian warlord known as ``Arkan,'' widely regarded as one of the worst perpetrators of atrocities. It was also common knowledge that Russian officers directed U.N. tankers to unload gas at Arkan's barracks. During one cease- fire, when Serbian materiel was locked in a U.N. storage area, a Russian apparently gave the keys to the Serbs, who removed 51 tanks. Eventually, Khromchenkov was repatriated. Loginov, after finishing his tour of duty, joined Arkan's Serbian forces. Problems remained, however, under the leadership of another Russian commander, Maj. Gen. Aleksandr Perelyakin. Belgian troops had been blocking the movement of Serb troops across a bridge in northeastern Croatia, as required by U.N. Security Council resolutions. Perelyakin ordered the Belgians to stand aside. Reluctantly they did so, permitting one of the largest movements of Serbian troops and equipment into the region since the 1991 cease-fire. According to internal U.N. reports, the U.N. spent eight months quietly trying to pressure Moscow to pull Perelyakin back, but the Russians refused. The U.N. finally dismissed him last April. cambodia In 1991, the United States, China and the Soviet Union helped broker a peace treaty among three Cambodian guerrilla factions and the Vietnamese-installed Cambodian government, ending 21 years of civil war. To ease the transition to Cambodia's first democratic government, the U.N. created the U.N. Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). In less than two years, about 20,000 U.N. peacekeepers and other personnel were dispatched at a cost of $1.9 billion. Some of the Cambodian ``peacekeepers'' proved to be unwelcome guests--especially a Bulgarian battalion dubbed the ``Vulgarians.'' In northwest Cambodia, three Bulgarian soldiers were killed for ``meddling'' with local girls. One Bulgarian was treated for 17 different cases of VD. The troops' frequent carousing once sparked a mortar-rifle battle with Cambodian soldiers at a brothel. The Bulgarians were not the sole miscreants in Cambodia, as internal U.N. audits later showed. Requests from Phnom Penh included 6500 flak jackets--and 300,000 condoms. In the year after the U.N. peacekeepers arrived, the number of prostitutes in Phnom Penh more than tripled. U.N. mission chief Yasushi Akashi waved off Cambodian complaints with a remark that ``18-year-old hot-blooded soldiers'' had the right to enjoy themselves, drink a few beers and chase ``young beautiful beings.'' He did post an order: ``Please do not park your U.N. vans near the nightclubs'' (i.e., whorehouses). At least 150 U.N. peacekeepers contracted AIDS in Cambodia; 5000 of the troops came down with VD. Meanwhile, more than 1000 generators were ordered, at least 330 of which, worth nearly $3.2 million, were never used for the mission. When U.N. personnel started spending the $234.5 million budgeted for ``premises and accommodation,'' rental costs became so inflated that natives could barely afford to live in their own country. Some $80 million was spent buying vehicles, including hundreds of surplus motorcycles and minibuses. When 100 12-seater minibuses were needed, 850 were purchased--an ``administrative error,'' UNTAC explained, that cost $8.3 million. Despite the excesses, the U.N. points with pride to the free election that UNTAC sponsored in May 1993. Ninety percent of Cambodia's 4.7 million eligible voters defied death threats from guerrilla groups and went to the polls. Unfortunately, the election results have been subverted by the continued rule of the Cambodian People's Party--the Vietnamese-installed Communist government, which lost at the ballot box. In addition, the Khmer Rouge--the guerrilla group that butchered more than a million countrymen in the 1970s-- have refused to disarm and demobilize. So it was predictable that they would repeatedly break the ceasefire and keep up their killing. The U.N. has spent nearly $2 billion, but there is no peace in Cambodia. somalia When civil war broke out in this African nation, the resulting anarchy threatened 4.5 million Somalis--over half the population--with severe malnutrition and related diseases. U.N. Secretary General Boutros [[Page H 13795]] Boutros Ghali, the first African (and Arab) to hold the position, argued eloquently for a U.N. peacekeeping mission to ensure safe delivery of food and emergency supplies. The U.N. Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) was deployed to Mogadishu, the capital, in September 1992. It was quickly pinned down at the airport by Somali militiamen and was unable to complete its mission. A U.S. task force deployed in December secured the Mogadishu area, getting supplies to the hungry and ill. After the Americans left, the U.N. took over in May 1993 with UNOSOM II. The $2-million-a-day operation turned the former U.S. embassy complex into an 80-acre walled city boasting air-conditioned housing and a golf course. When U.N. officials ventured out of the compound, their ``taxis'' were helicopters that cost $500,000 a week. The published commercial rate for Mogadishu-U.S. phone calls was $4.91 a minute, but the ``special U.N. discount rate'' was $8.41. Unauthorized personal calls totaled more than $2 million, but the U.N. simply picked up the tab and never asked the callers to pay. Meanwhile, the peacekeeping effort disintegrated, particularly as warlord Mohammed Aidid harassed UNOSOM II troops. As the civil war continued, Somalis starved. But U.N. peacekeepers--on a food budget of $56 million a year--dined on fruit from South America, beef from Australia from frozen fish from New Zealand and the Netherlands. Thousands of yards of barbed wire arrived with no barbs; hundreds of light fixtures to illuminate the streets abutting the compound had no sockets for light bulbs. What procurement didn't waste, pilferage often took care of. Peacekeeping vehicles disappeared with regularity, and Egyptian U.N. troops were suspected of large scale black-marketing of minibuses. These losses, however, were eclipsed in a single night by an enterprising thief who broke into a U.N. office in Mogadishu and made off with $3.9 million in cash. The office door was easy pickings: its lock could be jimmied with a credit card. The money, stored in the bottom drawer of a filing cabinet, had been easily visible to dozens of U.N. employees. While the case has not been solved, one administrator was dismissed and two others were disciplined. Last summer, UNOSOM II itself was shut down, leaving Somalia to the same clan warfare that existed when U.N. troops were first deployed two years before. RWANDA Since achieving independence in 1962, Rwanda has erupted in violence between the majority Hutu tribe and minority Tutsis. The U.N. had a peacekeeping mission in that nation, but it fled as the Hutus launched a new bloodbath in April 1994. Only 270 U.N. troops stayed behind, not enough to prevent the butchery of at least 14 local Red Cross workers left exposed by the peacekeepers' swift flight. The U.N. Security Council dawdled as the dead piled up, and a daily horror of shooting, stabbings and machete hackings. The Hutus were finally driven out by a Tutsi rebel army in late summer 1994. Seven U.N. agencies and more than 100 international relief agencies rushed back. With a budget of some $200 million, the U.N. tried unsuccessfully to provide security over Hutu refugee camps in Rwanda and aid to camps in neighboring Zaire. The relief effort was soon corrupted when the U.N. let the very murderers who'd massacred a half million people take over the camps. Rather than seeking their arrest and prosecution, the U.N. made deals with the Hutu thugs, who parlayed U.N. food, drugs and other supplies into millions of dollars on the black market. Earlier this year the U.N. began to pull out of the camps. On April 22 at the Kibeho camp in Rwanda, the Tutsi-led military opened fire on Hutu crowds. Some 2000 Hutus were massacred. Where was the U.N.? Overwhelmed by the presence of nearly 2000 Tutsi soldiers, the 200 U.N. peacekeepers did nothing. A U.N. spokesman told Reader's Digest, meekly, that the U.N. was on the scene after the slaughter for cleanup and body burial. With peacekeeping operations now costing over $3 billion a year, reform is long overdue. Financial accountability can be established only by limiting control by the Secretariat, which routinely withholds information about peacekeeping operations until the last minute--too late for the U.N.'s budgetary committee to exercise oversight. In December 1993, for example, when the budget committee was given one day to approve a $600-million budget that would extend peacekeeping efforts into 1994, U.S. representative Michael Michalski lodged an official protest: ``If U.S. government employees approved a budget for a similar amount with as little information as has been provided to the committee, they would likely be thrown in jail.'' More fundamentally, the U.N. needs to re-examine its whole peacekeeping approach, for the experiment in nation building has been bloody and full of failure. Lofty ideas to bring peace everywhere in the world have run aground on reality: member states with competing interests in warring territories, the impossibility of lightly armed troops keeping at bay belligerent enemies, and the folly of moving into places without setting achievable goals. ``It has been a fundamental error to put U.N. peacekeepers in place where there is no peace to keep,'' says Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), ranking minority member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``We've seen very vividly that the U.N. is not equipped, organized or financed to intervene and fight wars.'' ____ [From the Paris Match, Oct. 5, 1995] Our Pilots are Prisoners of the Serbs (Translated by David Skelly) Two tiny points in an incandescent sky. These images have been holding us in cruel suspense for nearly a month. The two points are two French officers, a captain pilot and a lieutenant navigator, shot down on August 30 in their Mirage 2000-K2, almost directly above Pale, the capital of the Bosnian Serbs, during the first NATO raid. Three exfiltration missions according to the CSAR (combat, search and rescue procedure), which had succeeded in rescuing Captain O'Grady, failed. The Serbs have confirmed that they are holding two men alive, but no one, not even the Red Cross envoys has actually seen them. These photos reached us from Pale. Here are the faces of the two prisoners whom France has been anxiously waiting to see. The first scenes of their captivity. Peasants turned the lieutenant over to the `special forces commandos'. Being helped to walk by two Serbs from their special forces, Lieutenant Jose Souvignet seems to be suffering from a leg wound. Peasants turned the two airmen over to the ``specijali,'' who have been hiding them from the whole world ever since. The captain, Frederique Chiffot, snarls at his guards. Contrary to what happened with the American pilot, ours were brought down in broad daylight, above a mountain in an area with a high density of Serbian soldiers. Militiamen in the city of Pale were able to be there when they came down, and so it was impossible for the Frenchmen to escape. As soon as they hit ground they were captured and stripped of their warning, location, and survival equipment. Since these unique photos were taken, probably very shortly after their capture (in the foreground, a militiaman is still holding their helmets), they have probably been moved from their place of captivity, making it very difficult to exfiltrate them. According to rare Serbian information, it was thought that only Lieutenant Jose Souvignet had a leg wound. But here, Captain Frederique Chiffot, grimacing at the camera, also seems to be supported by members of the militia. Three attempts already: NATO is doing everything possible to free them. From September 5th to the 8th, three times over, NATO commandos have flown off in search of the two Frenchmen. These very complicated missions make use of airplanes and helicopters which have taken off from different bases, from Italian territory or the aircraft carrier ``Theodore Roosevelt.'' On board this ship, the Admiral Smith's general staff is coordinating, second by second, the delicate precision engineering of this warriors' ballet. The first attempt was completely American, but the weather was not on our side. The second and third attempts were French and American. Only the latter enabled the commandos to set down on a meadow near Pale. In vain. They had to withdraw under fire from the Serbs before having found the prisoners. When they were taken back up in the helicopter, two had been wounded. In the control room of the ``Theodore Roosevelt'' operations are being followed in real time. It was in an identical Mirage 2000 that the two pilots were brought down. Photos of the debris from the crash were widely disseminated in the press by the Serbs. ","[""The Speaker pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of May 12, 1995, the gentleman from California [Mr. Dornan] is recognized for 60 minutes. "", 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' I did not realize your time was wrapping up, Mr. ', 'Burton. I ', 'just wanted to, in a colloquy with you, underscore what you said about the targeting of Americans by people from outside Bosnia. ', 'The MOIS,', ' the secret police of Iran, have people in all the areas in Bosnia and around there. They are the security for shipping arms to the Moslem Bosnians through Zagreb with the complicity, the tolerance of the Croatian Government, all the way up to President Franjo Tudjman. They have targeted Americans for over a year. ', 'Mr. BURTON ', 'of Indiana. And they are having Americans killed, you might add. ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', "" Yes. Now here is what adds a dimension to this today. Someone who has told me who I trust--now this makes it hearsay and puts it in the category of rumor for our friends in the dominant media culture. The liberals will go wild here, but a meeting took place at the White House, all the key players from Defense and from the State Department and security agencies, and Clinton himself expressed concern and asked many questions about the mujaheddin from Iran, the bad mujaheddin, just like we had good and bad in Afghanistan--the Hamas, some of the groups you have named, and the secret police, the terrorist secret police of Iran. He asked about them targeting Americans. He has known about this for a year. {time} 1645 The President is purported to have said, looking at Leon Panetta, my classmate from 1976, ``Do not let the Congress get fired up on this. Downplay this when you talk to the Congressmen and the Senators.'' In other words, instead of telling the American people the danger that we are in, and, to quote his own words which I will do in a minute, he is asking them to downplay the threat to our Americans. "", 'Mr. BURTON ', 'of Indiana. If the gentleman will continue to yield, the fact of the matter is we know there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Moslem terrorists from Iran who are in the Bosnia area right now. We do not know how many. We have no idea. The fact of the matter is that some of those people were involved in such tragedies here in America as the World Trade Center bombing. They do not like our policies, they do not like America very much. When you put troops, American troops strung out between, say, Sarajevo and Tuzla, that long corridor 2\\1/2\\ miles wide, you are leaving them open for an attack anyplace among that line. That means that you are probably going to have, anyplace along that corridor for Sarajevo to Tuzla that there could be a bomber, there could be a mortar attack, there could be any kind of attack on our troops and they will not know when it is coming. I remember when President Clinton had a number of us in the White House when we were in Mogadishu, in Somalia. The President came up with a new policy. He said he was going to billet our troops on the tarmac at the airport there in Mogadishu. He said they would be safe. They would be there as a security measure, but they would not be involved in any combat or other operations. This was after we started nation building, we quit the food handling over there. Two days later the Aideed forces, the terrorist tribal leader over there, lobbed mortars into the exact spot where our soldiers were going to be billeted. That was not anything like Bosnia, yet if we had had troops in that area where the President said they were going to be, and they found out about it, there would have been many of them killed. Think about that when you talk about a corridor between Sarajevo and Tuzla, 2\\1/2\\ miles wide with 25,000 American troops in there. They could pick any spot along there, any time day or night, attack our troops and kill hundreds, maybe thousands of them. This is a recipe for disaster. I appreciate the gentleman for yielding to me. The President should reconsider, and he should come clean with the American people. If he said what you alleged he said to Leon Panetta, you know, we do not let the Congress get into this thing, then he should be taken to task. I do not know if he said it or not. The American people need to know the risks. There are going to be young women lose their legs, their arms, their eyes from these land mines, but even a greater risk is the possibility of a terrorist attack from possibly Bosnian Serbs who are going to be upset about losing their homes and the problems around Sarajevo, or possibly Moslem terrorist from Iran. There are a number of people who do not like what is going on over there. They do not like anybody very much. I think our troops are really at risk. It is a mistake to get into this quagmire. ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', "" Dan, stay with me just a minute here, because I have been to Central America with you several times, we have both been to Haiti and been very concerned about what is happening there. We both have taken a personal interest in the calls that are coming into our offices from families of men who are in active duty in Germany and who resented Clinton referring to them as volunteers. One mother said to one of my staffers, My son is not a French legionnaire or a mercenary, he did not join the military to fight under any flag, he joined and took an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And he did take a follow-on order that we do not take as Congressmen Newt would like this probably at this point, that we will obey all lawful orders of our commander. But it is coming down to the word ``lawful.'' Because you suffered through Mogadishu and spoke so forcefully and eloquently on the floor, I want to share something with you. "", 'When I ', ""was in my thirties I produced my own TV show. We had, the year I started, just gotten state-of-the-art close-up lenses where we could go in on an ant on the set and fill someone's television screen at home with that ant. Here we are, 27 years later, since I first started in December of 1967 28 years later, and we cannot call for a close-up with these good Americans down in the control room a couple of floors below us, and it is too bad. I think the day is going to come, just like some day we will have color in the Congressional Record. "", 'Mr. BURTON ', 'of ', 'Indiana. I ', 'would like for them to see this map. ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' If they can see this Posavina corridor that we are supposed to widen by the Dayton-Wright Patterson treaty, widen and enforce---- ', 'Mr. BURTON ', 'of Indiana. If the Americans could see the corridor we are supposed to try to defend---- ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' Hold that steady and maybe the camera here in the southeast corner of the House could come in, point with your finger---- ', 'Mr. BURTON ', 'of Indiana. It is going to run all the way this way. ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', "" Take it from there at the top. The little pink strip there, between the part of Serb-held Bosnia that is against Milosevic's Bosnia-Serbia proper and Montenegro, and this huge glob in the northern part of what is Bosnia, this little, tiny Posavina corridor, 2\\1/2\\ miles, is supposed to be expanded to five. Keep in mind the Israelis were properly always exercised about the distance from the furthest west point of the West Bank, Judea, from Natanya, by the sea, was 18 miles. They say that is an artillery-lobbed shell. This is 2\\1/2\\. Our men---- "", 'Mr. BURTON ', 'of Indiana. You have been in the military you might tell our [[', 'Page H ', '13788]] colleagues how far a mortar will go, how far they can stay back from that 2\\1/2\\-mile-wide corridor to hit American troops if they wanted to lob something in there. ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', "" The mortars that hit the marketplace in Tuzla when I was in Zagreb the 28th of August, and threw bodies every which way, killed 60 or 70 people and maimed 150; when I look at that ``maimed,'' I always think ``Who is blind? Who has no legs there? Who lost all their fingers there?'' We always put the death toll in bigger caps than the maimed. That is lives changed forever. A person will never earn the same income. Those mortars could be 5 or 10 miles from the corridor and lob these shells into the corridor. "", 'Mr. BURTON ', 'of Indiana. The point is they could get within a half a mile and be more accurately targeted in. That is the problem. ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', "" I wish almost, like in every television show, we had a monitor buried in the table here so we could see. I don't know how close they can come in on this picture, but I am going to walk over there and give it to you so you can look at this handsome young American soldier's face, First Sergeant Randall "", 'Shughart. I ', 'visited his grave 2 weeks ago in ', 'Carlisle, PA.', "" His parents sent me this picture because they did not like the standard Army picture. They said, ``This is more what Randy looked like when he was helping us on the farm.'' I am sure that as close as they can get, it is just a color picture of a handsome young fellow with a closely cropped beard and a cowboy hat, in his barn. Take a look at this while I tell you this story. Randy Shughart, together with Gary Gordon, begged the headquarters at Mogadishu International Airport to let them go down and disembark from their helicopter, because they could see movement in the cockpit of Michael Durant's crashed Blackhawk helicopter. Three times they were told no. They were, in a sense, because they knew the odds, begging to die for their friends. St. John the Evangelist 15:13, ``Greater love no man has than he died for his friends.'' They saved Durant. Durant hugging me, and both of us crying, told me that he owes his life to Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon. All four men had spine injuries when that helicopter made a hard landing. The helicopter that he disembarked took a direct hit of a rocket-propelled grenade and blew out one of the door posts and tore the leg right off one of the door gunners. I talked to the young Corporal Hall who jumped in and took over the door gun, and they flew back to Newport and crashed the helicopter, totaling it out. So that day we lost Wolcott's helicopter, Cliff Wolcott, killing him and his pilot, and then we lost this one, Durant's, and then we lost that one to a total accident after they were out of it. They held off for about 30 minutes. I have asked the Army for their last transcriptions. Durant told me the last thing Gordon or Shughart said to him was ``Good luck, pal. I hope you make it.'' Went around the front of the helicopter, heard him take a couple of shots, heard him grunt with pain. Hopefully they died with the rifle shots as the crowd overwhelmed the helicopter and captured Durant. Durant told me another man was lying on the ground, and I will not give his name because of his parents, and he was taken alive with Durant. They beat him to death. Then they began to so abuse their bodies that now that it is 2 years and 2 months later, a former Congressman said to me tonight, ``Congressman, these men are owned by America. Why don't you tell the country what happened to them?'' I will not, but I will go further than I have ever gone before. These five men, including the two that won the Medal of Honor and including Randy Shughart's picture you have there, they did not just mutilate their bodies and drag them through the streets and stick rifles and poles into every bodily orifice, including their mouths, and have women and children dance upon them in the streets for Canadian Broadcasting, the guy won a Pulitzer Prize for his video and film coverage, Paul something, they cut their arms off the bodies. We never got those limbs back. They dumped their burned remains on the steps of the United Nation every 2 days until we had gotten back---- "", 'Mr. BURTON ', 'of Indiana. ', 'If I ', 'may interrupt, that was never reported to the American people? ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', "" Never. Look at Randy's handsome face, and he was born in "", 'Lincoln, NE.', "" I showed this to our Medal of Honor winner, the Senator from Nebraska, Bob Kerrey, and he started at him intently, and I said, ``This guy is from Lincoln.'' And he said, ``Are you sure?'' and I said yes, I thought he was buried there. And then the Army told me where, so I went to his grave, because the week before when I was at a presidential forum in "", 'Bangor, ME,', ' and I had asked where the other Lincoln was, in ', 'Lincoln, ME,', "" where Gary Gordon is from. ``Two Young Men from Lincoln'' is the story I would like to write. They said, ``50 minutes north of here,'' and I took my son and drove up this first week of November to Gary Gordon's grave. I said to Mark, ``I want to see Randy Shughart's grave.'' His dad, that man there, his father is the one who refused to shake Clinton's hand in the East Ballroom of the White House, and Bob Kerrey, Senator, told me he was at this ceremony and remembers it vividly. I said, ``How is it Bob, the press never reported that story, that it only came out on talk radio?'' Mr. Shughart, a basic American farmer type, retired in Carlisle near his son's grave. He told me that he said to Clinton, ``Why did you fly Aideed down to Addis Abbaba days after this people killed and multilated my son's body?'' "", 'Mr. BURTON ', 'of Indiana. He was the dictator and tribal terrorist over there that was responsible for that. ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', "" Another Fidel Castro, another General Jopp, another Aristide, the same mold, all of them. He said Clinton told him, ``I did not know about that operation.'' "", 'Mr. BURTON ', 'of Indiana. If the gentleman will yield, that is a ludicrous statement for anybody to make, because the administration had their Ambassador over there, negotiating with Aideed during a lot of this stuff that was going on. They knew entirely, from intelligence sources, what was going on. It is absolutely unbelievable that they would make a statement like that. Let me just add one more thing. ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' It is Clinton making the statement to the father of a dead, murdered, Medal of Honor winner. ', 'Mr. BURTON ', 'of ', 'Indiana. I ', 'just cannot believe that is the case. The President said in his speech---- ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' He meant the operation, taking Aideed down to Addis Abbaba. ', 'Mr. BURTON ', ""of Indiana. The President said, ``I take full responsibility for whatever might happen over there.'' The fact of the matter is he should take full responsibility for what happened in Mogadishu to those men who got killed. They did not send proper equipment there, they did not send M-1 A-1 tanks, they did not send Bradley armored vehicles. He knew they should have sent those over there. The men trapped there, they did not get to them in that little town for 40 or 50 minutes because they could not get through the crowds.

The fact of the matter is we lost some of those men because we did not get there quick enough. ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' Four or five died during the night. ', 'Mr. BURTON ', 'of Indiana. The fact of the matter is we are going to lose more young men and women, many more times, 40 or 50 more times in ', 'Bosnia. I ', 'think the President is making a terrible mistake. ', 'Mr. SCARBBOROUGH.', ' Will the gentleman yield? ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' I yield to the gentleman from Florida. ', 'Mr. SCARBOROUGH.', ' I thank the gentleman from California for yielding, and thank him for all of his service on the Committee on National Security, where we have worked together. I certainly appreciate the comments you have made about the horrible treatment that American soldiers have to go through, and humanizing this process. Let me tell you something that really has disturbed me during this debate. There have been three falsehoods. The first is that we should blindly fall in line behind our Commander in Chief, regardless of what he suggests. We [[', 'Page H ', ""13789]] should send out troops, whether we know if there is a vital American interest, a time line, or all of the things we need to make this successful. I remember back in the mid-1990's, before I was in Congress, and you were here, maybe you can expand on this in a minute or two, just to remind Americans that there can be a loyal opposition. I remember when we were trying to remove Communists, when Ronald Reagan was trying to remove Communists from Central America, there were actually Members of this body that wrote Communist leader Ortega in Nicaragua and apologized for our support of the freedom fighters. These same people tell us that we cannot even debate this openly, so America can decide whether they want young American men and women killed in Bosnia? Let us make no mistake of it, we have sat through the briefings on the Committee on National Security. Everybody that comes in says, ``Young Americans will die if they go to Bosnia and get involved in a civil war that has been raging for over 500 years.'' What have we kept asking? We have kept saying, ``What is the vital American interest?'' {time} 1700 They have set up straw men and tried to knock them down, saying that if we did not get involved that somehow our credibility in "", 'NATO ', 'would be greatly diminished. That is a joke. The fact of the matter is, we are ', 'NATO.', ' We have protected ', 'NATO ', 'countries for a generation from the threat of communism, and we will continue. ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' A generation and a half. ', 'Mr. SCARBOROUGH.', ' A generation and a half. We are ', 'NATO.', ' So that is a straw man. Then they talk about it expanding and starting World ', 'War III.', ' I heard the Vice President make that statement. That is blatantly false. It will not expand. The testimony that we have heard in the Committee on National Security clearly shows that that will not happen. I yield to the gentleman from Indiana. ', 'Mr. BURTON ', 'of Indiana. Let me just say that I remember when the other side, when we were in Vietnam, and they were talking about the domino theory, they pooh-poohed that. Of course, now the same people who are doing that are saying, oh, my gosh, this may be a world war. The fact of the matter is, this war is not going to spread unless everybody decides that they want to let it spread. ', 'Mr. SCARBOROUGH.', "" Is it not ironic that the very same people during the Vietnam war that were protesting in the streets and on campuses across this country were saying, we cannot be the world's policeman. These are the same people, 30 years later, who are saying, let us sacrifice young Americans because it will make us feel good about ourselves. The fact of the matter is, there is no vital American interest. The Secretary of Defense admitted as much, and it was in Time magazine, that there is not a vital American interest. But what is disturbing to me is, now we are seeing people saying, well, maybe, since we are beyond the cold war, maybe we do not need a vital American interest. I hear that we have a volunteer army. You notice that is what they are saying. It is a volunteer army, they signed up for this, so we can send them off. It does not matter whether there is a vital American interest, and we spend all of this money on the military, so let us use our military. That is obscene. "", 'Mr. BURTON ', 'of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, it is. ', 'Mr. SCARBOROUGH.', "" That is why I thank the gentleman from California and the gentleman from Indiana for talking about the harsh realities of war. Does it mean that Americans are gun-shy and that we do not believe that any American troops should ever be sent into harm's way? No. But is it asking too much to say, let there be a vital American interest so when the President of the United States picks up the phone and calls a parent and says, your son was just blown apart in Bosnia, but he did it for a good reason. He did it because, and that is where they start to fade out. Because, maybe the "", 'NATO ', 'people will feel better because we have sacrificed, had human sacrifices in ', 'Bosnia. I ', 'do not want to trivialize this point, but it is so central to this argument, we have to define what a vital American interest is. We have head the Secretary of Defense, we have heard the Secretary of State, we have heard General Shalikashvili, we have heard a lot of good military men and women come before our Committee on National Security, and all have failed to state that vital American interest. I do not fault them; I fault the Commander in Chief. ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' Let my good colleague from Florida pause for a moment while I show the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Burton] and the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Scarborough] another photograph, and a series of photographs starting on the cover of Paris Match magazine that you are not going to forget. I guarantee you that you will be bringing this up at town hall meetings. First of all, I hand to Mr. Burton a picture from a war that has great personal significance for me that started in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on June 28, 1914, when a Bosnian Serb murdered Archduke Ferdinand and his wife, Carlotta, the heir to the throne of the Austro- Hungarian empire, and changed Europe for this whole century and began the bloodiest war in its time, 11 million killed, the flower of European youth, and it set us up for World ', 'War II ', 'where 55 to 60 million died, and it set up Stalin and Lenin and communism where 100 million more died, including China.

My dad had suffered poison gas, mustard gas twice, shrapnel in his face under his eye, three-wound chevrons turned into Purple Hearts in a ceremony that I witnessed in the Seventh Armory in New York. If my dad were still alive, he went to his reward in 1975 at 83 years of age, he would be saying to me, in the last 4 years of the bloodiest century in all of history, ``We are going back to the hills around Sarajevo where this killing started?'' "", 'Now I ', ""want to show you both something. I am going to read the text while Dan looks at this and then he gives it to you. I have been on the French Embassy for months to get photographs of the two French pilots in a double seat Mirage 2000 that were shot down while I am at Aviano greeting our pilots back on August 30. They said, ``Uh-oh, we have lost an airplane.'' My heart starts pounding. Is this guy going to be as lucky as young Captain "", ""Scott O'"", ""Grady? Is he coming down on our side of the line like a British Harrier pilot 2 years earlier? Is he going to come down into Serb hands? Then they come in. I was talking to my wife on the phone. You cannot talk on the phone, but it is a French airplane. We take a two-seater. Then we hear there were good shoots. I am supposed to greet the squadron commander. He bends around in the air, goes back to the tanker and goes back to cover him. On the evening news here you saw their two good parachutes come down. That was August 30. Fifty-two days later, an indicted war criminal indicted at The Hague in the Netherlands by an international war crimes tribunal, Radovan Karadvic, says, ``Oh, the two French pilots were kidnapped from the hospital. What were they doing in a hospital 52 days after? They had good parachutes.'' I am about to show you their pictures the day of capture. The French embassy calls me about Frederique "", 'Chiffot, C-', 'H-I-F-F-O-T. I misspelled it when I said it on the floor last. The other one is Souvignet, ', 'Jose, J-', 'O-S-E.

The French Foreign Minister thinks that they have been murdered, beaten to death. When Karadzic says they were kidnapped he says, maybe by Moslems; Moslems would not do that, not with the support we are giving them; and he said, or by some band of a rogue brigands for a hostage reward. There has been no asking for money. Look at these pictures. Look at this man's face. The lieutenant, probably the back-seater; well, not necessarily, maybe the captain was the back-seat radar intercept officer. Turn the page. Look at how, like our pilots first captured in Vietnam, he is making this mean grimace into the camera like, I am resisting and I am okay. They are mature men. They are in their mid 30's, you can tell. Why at Dayton, at Wright Patterson, did not somebody say to Milosevic, by the way, all of this is predicated upon the return of these two French allied pilots who are our friends and comrades in arms? The whole deal is off, and here we are on day 82, 30 days after they announced they were kidnapped from a hospital that they should not have been in, and that could be two Americans in a heartbeat. "", 'Mr. BURTON ', 'of Indiana. Bob, it is probably going to be more than two. We are going to have 25,000 there, plus support troops, in that 2\\1/2\\- mile-wide corridor, and they will be able to attack at any point along that corridor, at any time, day or night, with mortars, land mines, or they can use a terrorist attack with a truck bomb.

We are getting involved in a three-way civil war that we cannot begin to fathom, the emotions and the hatred. It is just like Mogadishu that you talked about before. We are going even beyond the original U.N. charter where we were only supposed to get involved when the sovereign state was attacked. Why are we putting Americans in the middle of a three-way civil war with what you talked about, war-hardened criminals, for the most part, that will kill Americans as soon as look at them? ', 'Mr. BURTON ', ""of Indiana. Let me just say something here. Mr. Speaker, this administration has a history of blunders in foreign policy decisions. Haiti, we are now finding out, is costing us hundreds of millions of dollars, and all hell is breaking loose down there. There are a lot of political killings that have been instigated in part by Aristide's own rhetoric. He is now saying he may not leave power, and he is using almost $2 million of American taxpayers' money to lobby Congress for more money. We have Mogadishu and Somalia and the tragedies that occurred there, and now we are going to do the same thing or worse in Bosnia? It makes no sense. This administration needs to get a foreign policy compass. They need to get some direction in their foreign policy, get some experts up there that know what they are doing and know what they are getting us into. "", 'Mr. DORNAN.', "" But where was Clinton this morning? Speaking to the British Parliament, instead of over here counseling with us and figuring out how we can contribute to this. Now, let me bounce off of both of you my notes from Clinton's remarks on Monday night. First of all, he did take you on with that first question of yours and me. "", 'Because I ', ""put 50 questions to him in the Congressional Record just yesterday and put in the Cap Weinberger-Bob Dornan principles, the 10 things that you must satisfy before you put men, and now, thanks to Les Aspin, women, in harm's way. He said, this is Central Europe. It is vital to our national interests. So he used the word. He said so. This House, by a vote of 243 to 171 says no, and it shows you that if there is ever a constitutional power that does not involve the purse, the President can send people anywhere in this world. Wilson asked for a declaration of war. So did Roosevelt. But Harry Truman got into Korea and did not know how to get out and it cost him his "", 'Presidency. LBJ,', ' thanks to Kennedy, got into Vietnam, did not know how to extract himself, threw his hands up on March 31, 1968, and said, I am out of here. I will serve out and try and conduct the war. He did not do anything except keep a bombing pause on for all of 1968 that he made even more severe to try and throw the election to Humphrey and destroyed his Presidency. Listen to what Clinton says. They, that is you, Mr. Scarborough, Mr. Burton, and me, and a majority of this House and Senate, they argue America can now step back. As young people would say, excuse me. Step back? We have almost 500 men in Macedonia. We have air power, sea power. We lost that French airplane and lucked out with our American air crew. We threw 90 percent of the strikes that cost those two Frenchmen 82 days of freedom. Please, God, that they are still alive and being moved from village to village. He says, we are going to end the suffering. How much money are we pouring into that area with airlift and sealift? You men should walk through the hospital at Zagreb at the airport. You should look at the U.N. facilities and the U.N. personnel there who are all overpaid, and every nickel they get is tax-free, all the bureaucrats. ', 'Mr. BURTON ', ""of Indiana. Let me just say, he said he is going to end the suffering and we are going to be there 1 year. In 1 year we are going to be in and out, we are going to end the suffering, and this is a civil war, civil strife that has been going on, as you said, for 500 years or more. I am telling you, you are not going to change these people's attitudes, take away their homes and give them to somebody else, solve all of these problems in a year and make this country whole. It is just not going to happen. "", 'Mr. SCARBOROUGH.', ' To expand on that briefly, getting back to the testimony we heard from the Committee on National Security, and I am sure you were there. When a retired U.N. general from Canada talked to us about the folly that you were just talking about, about us believing that we can send in one division in 1 year and bring peace to Bosnia for the 21st century, he said that he was responsible for surveying the crimes against humanity, being a monitor for what the Serbs did. One morning he was on the roadside and had to go out and look at a slaughter. The Serbs had slaughtered Moslem children, they had slaughtered women, had slaughtered elderly people. As he was looking at, surveying the scene, a Serb came up to him and he said, well, it serves them right. And the U.N. general turned and said, it serves them right for what? And the Serb responded, it serves them right for what they did to us in 1473. ', 'Mr. BURTON ', 'of Indiana. In 1473. ', 'Mr. SCARBOROUGH.', ' And then the general was silent for a moment, and he looked at the committee. A smile went across his face, and he said, and you Americans believe that you can send in one division for 1 year and make a difference? You are kidding yourselves. You had better stay out. That comes from a man who had been there a lot longer than anybody in the administration and who understands it a lot better than anybody serving in this administration. {time} 1715 ', 'Mr. BURTON ', ""of Indiana. Let me just say one thing, there is an old statement, ``Those that don't profit from history are destined to make the same mistakes over and over and over again.'' This administration in its foreign policy decisions has not looked at history. They do not have the underpinning, the background necessary to be making these decisions. Yet they are going right ahead, hell-bent for leather, making these decisions, putting our young people in harm's way. "", 'Mr. SCARBOROUGH.', ' The irony is, I know this is sort of the electrified [[', 'Page H ', '13791]] third realm, we do not want to get into it because he is our President, our Commander in ', 'Chief. I ', ""will just talk about the administration generally. The irony is that the people that are sitting in this administration now are the same people 20 years ago, 30 years ago protesting the Vietnam war. Not only have they not learned from European history, they have not learned the lessons of Vietnam that they taught the country: that unless the American people are solidly behind a military action, and unless there is an immediate vital interest, we do not get involved in other people's civil wars. I thought that is what the Vietnam protests were about. I thought that is what the President and many others in good conscience protested about during the Vietnam war, that this was not our war, that there was not a direct American interest, that America had to leave that civil war to Vietnam. If they wanted to protest that 25, 30 years ago, I am not going to second-guess them or challenge them. That was their right. But why are these same people 30 yeas ago who were telling us that we cannot be policemen of the world and get involved in other people's conflicts, why are these same people, now that they are in charge 30 years later, asking us to do the same exact thing? "", 'Mr. DORNAN.', "" Try just 26 years ago, this very week. Clinton himself, ditching class at Oxford, left for Oslo, Stockholm, Helsinki, Leningrad, 2\\1/2\\ days in Moscow, in Prague, on a tour to help secure victory for Hanoi. It had nothing to do with peace or ending the war in some sort of neutrality respecting the DMZ at the 17th parallel. It was to secure a victory for Hanoi. Here is an article in the current Insight magazine, the one that has Newt on the cover. It says, ``McNamara met the enemy and it turned out to be him.'' On Bosnia, ``There is a chilling McNamara-like rhetoric'' coming from administration people. ``Perry's assertion,'' Secretary of defense Perry, ``is the same guff that McNamara tossed off during Vietnam.'' It says, ``Only industrial strength arrogance can account for Robert Strange McNamara's visit to Hanoi on Veterans Day. The former defense secretary at least is unchanging in the lack of sensibility that characterized his Pentagon tenure during the Vietnam War.'' This is the man, McNamara, that said that we cannot use college men in the Vietnam struggle; they are our future. Clinton told his draft board, ``I'm too educated to go.'' Now we have, just as you pointed out, Joe, the very same people making sure Clinton does not make any reference to Vietnam in his speeches about suffering, I am looking at my notes again from Monday night, he says 250,000 people have been killed. In Cambodia it was 2 million, 8 times that. He says 2 million are on the road. They are alive. Because the road in the South China Sea meant sharks, pirates, and the death of 750,000 people, 68,000 who worked with us executed. And always the one order, the one order from Ho Chi Minh that they pursued even after he died in September 1969 was kill Americans. Are they thinking that when Haitians that we talked about on the docks were jumping up and down and saying, ``We're going to give you Somalia,'' at the end of October, referring to the man who was killed on the 6th, Matt Rearson, they had a dud land at the feet, 5 feet away from a two-star General Garrison. He told me about it himself. The 18 Rangers and helicopter pilots and Delta commandos like Randy Shugart and Gary Gordon, they are yelling about this on the docks of Haiti, 10, 12 days later, and turned around the Norton Sound. Do you not think that these people in Sarajevo who have constant "", 'TV, CNN,', ' probably watch some of our C-', 'SPAN ', ""debates, are not aware that the key to get Clinton to bug out is Clinton's next words? ``We must expect casualties,'' he said. Of all people, who is he to say that? "", 'Mr. BURTON ', ""of Indiana. Let me just say on the front page of the New York Times this week they quoted a gentleman from Sarajevo who lives, one of the 60,000 Bosnian Serbs that live around Sarajevo, and he said, ``What you're going to see is what you saw in Somalia when you saw that American dragged through the streets dead.'' Another lady who lives in one of those suburbs said, ``I'll kill myself and my kids before I'll let them take over my home and my property here.'' And those people are going to be coming back. I am telling you, when people say that they will even kill themselves and their kids, what do you think they are going to do to somebody else who tries to take their property? "", 'Mr. SCARBOROUGH.', ' If the gentleman will yield, once again drawing comparisons between Bosnia and ', 'Vietnam, I ', ""remember after the war was over listening to the words of the generals for North Vietnam. They said ``We knew we could not win the war in the jungles of Vietnam, but we knew we would win this war on the streets and the college campuses of America.'' "", 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' In the Halls of the Congress. ', 'Mr. SCARBOROUGH.', "" ``That is why we kept fighting.'' The same thing is going to happen now. That is why the Weinberger doctrine, which the gentlemen from California [Mr. Dornan] also worked on, that is why one of the key components was support from the American people. We have to have a campaign that Americans support. It is the President's responsibility to step forward and explain what the vital American interest is. Let me just say this. I will tell you this. A lot of people will say, ``Well, why are you all talking about Bosnia in such strident terms,'' and I will tell you, this is my feeling. We have to do it now. It is our responsibility. Because once those young men and women get in Bosnia, at that point I shut my mouth, I follow the Commander in "", 'Chief. I ', ""will not do what Members of this Congress did in the 1960's and play politics with the lives of American troops. So now is the time that we have to voice our opposition to this, because once the President makes that move, and I can only speak for myself, at that point I believe we as a country fall in line behind the Commander in Chief if he chooses to do that. But until that time comes, I think we need to point out that this is the most misguided foreign policy decision not only that this administration has made but any administration in this country has made since Vietnam. We have to do all we can to draw the line in the sand and tell the President, do not send young "", 'Americans. I ', 'already have men and women from my district over there. I have NAS Pensacola, Eglin Air Force Base, Hobart ', 'Field. I ', 'have got a lot of other bases. These are not just the military. It is not abstract terms. We are talking about men and women and the children of people I know, and also my own peers who have children that go to school with my 7-year-old boy in ', 'Pensacola, FL,', ' talking about how their father is going to be going to Bosnia. We are talking about killing real people. ', 'Mr. BURTON ', ""of Indiana. Human beings. Real people. The gentleman has said it very well. I do not think anybody could have said it better. The fact of the matter is that I think everybody in this Chamber, once our troops are on the ground, are going to say, ``Hey, we didn't want them there. They shouldn't be there, but they're there and we're going to support our American young men and women who are over there to do a job.'' But the fact of the matter is, I will be supporting our troops, but I certainly will not be supporting this President and this policy that he has adopted because I think it is going to get a lot of them killed. "", 'Mr. SCARBOROUGH.', ' What frightens me is this: The fact of the matter is that this has been a very emotional decision by this administration and it has been a decision based, I believe, on emotion. ', 'Because I ', 'watch ', 'TV. I ', ""talked about my 7-year-old boy. I saw on ABC News several months back a young 7-year-old Muslim boy was blown off his bicycle, and the boy was screaming and crying, and it looked just like my son. He said, ``Please don't cut off my leg. Don't cut off my leg.'' And the ABC reporter said ``Well, the 7-year-old boy's leg was not cut off but he did die 3 hours later.'' That hit me, and I said I know what the President has to be saying at times. We have got to do something. We have got to stop the killing. That is what my immediate response is, and that is what a lot of Americans think. [["", 'Page H ', ""13792]] But then you step back and you think through this process, and you are not run totally by emotion, and you say, ``Wait a second, it won't be young Bosnians that we are going to be seeing killed and TV 2 months from now, 3 months from now, if we go over there. It is going to be young Americans.'' We better make sure that it is a cause worth dying for, to make sure we do not repeat the same mistakes we made in Somalia, where we made an emotional decision to go over there. Then Americans were slaughtered, drug through the streets. Americans then made an emotional decision to bring them back. Let us not make that mistake again. Let us not base it on emotion. Let us base it on sound foreign policy. "", 'Mr. BURTON ', 'of Indiana. Let me just say one thing about Somalia. When President Bush sent our troops over there initially, it was to feed the hungry masses, and those people welcomed us with open arms and treated our troops very well. It was not until President Clinton made the decision to get into nation-building, which is what he is leading us into in Bosnia, that we started losing troops and ended up having to pull out of there and leaving that dictator Aideed back in power. ', 'Mr. SCARBOROUGH.', "" This is what is so frightening. I have heard testimony again before the Committee on National Security and I actually had somebody with a straight face tell me, from the administration, that we needed to go into Bosnia to, quote, reknit the fabric of the Bosnian society, close quote. That, my friend, is extremely frightening. It is extremely naive, and it is going to be young Americans' blood that will be spilled because of that naive view of geopolitical realities. "", 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' Mr. Speaker, some of the members of the dynamic freshman class of the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Scarborough] have joined us. I want to put one set of figures into the Record and make one comment, because Clinton at least heeded the warnings of this Congress not to put our men and women under the United ', 'Nations. I ', ""would ask people to please save their Reader's "", 'Digest. I ', ""will put this in the Record following our remarks, Dale Van Atta's article commissioned by Reader's Digest on ``The Folly of U.N. Peacekeeping.'' It begins thusly. ``Sonja's Kon-Tiki Cafe is a notorious Serbian watering hole 6 miles north of Sarajevo. While Serb soldiers perpetrated atrocities in all the Bosnian villages, local residents reported that U.N. peacekeepers,'' and it hurts me to read these names, ``from France, Ukraine, Canada, and New Zealand regularly visited Sonja's, drinking and eating with these very same soldiers'' committing the atrocities ``and sharing their women.'' However, the women of Sonja's Kon-Tiki Club were actually prisoners of the Serbs. These are Muslim and Croatian women. ``As one soldier, Borislav Herak, would later confess, he visited Sonja's several times a week, raping many of the 70 females present and killing two of them'' because he felt like it. "", 'Then I ', ""go down to Haiti and I see white U.N. vehicles, this wonderful dream that grew out of the League of Nations in my father's war, see white U.N. vehicles lined up at the houses of prostitution in Haiti, and wondered why the United Nations is so disrespected.

At this time, when Clinton says we are going to pull back, we have 2,267 people in "", 'Haiti. I ', 'did not know we had 30 in the western Sahara.

I thank the gentleman for using the French pronunciation of my name, which I do not hear very often. Thank you very much. I have been listening to the arguments and points made by my colleagues here. I think they made some very good, some very persuasive arguments. I would just like to reiterate some of the things they have made and make some new ones myself. ', 'First, I ', 'think it is important for us to always remember that these people in that very, very dangerous area of the world have been fighting with each other for centuries now, for hundreds of years. They have been battling each other, and, unfortunately, our President is now talking about and pushing forward with a plan which will put young Americans, both men and women, on the ground in Bosnia right in the middle of that bloody mess. I am very concerned that, rather than fighting and shooting at each other, in the very near future they are going to be shooting at Americans, and I hope and I pray that I am wrong. ', 'But I ', 'am very concerned that many, many Americans are going to come back to the shores of this country in body bags. There are many other dangers besides the snipers and rogue Serbs or rogue folks on either side lobbing mortars, mortar shells, artillery shells into our U.S. troops. There are 6 million mines in Bosnia. Many of those mines, nobody has a clue as to where they are at. People can be out on a routine patrol just walking down the street and could very easily set off a mine, could be mangled and mutilated or killed, and I am very concerned we are going to lost a lot of people to those very lethal instruments. That is the 6 million estimated mines there are throughout the Bosnian area. In addition, I think we really have to recognize that, whereas the Serbs have certainly been the most aggressive and have performed the most atrocious acts and have killed the most innocent people, that none of the parties really have clean hands in this incident. The Moslems, the Bosnian Moslems, and the Croats have also allegedly committed a number of atrocities themselves. All three parties have done some very awful things in the past couple of years in that very, very dangerous part of the world. Certainly, the Serbs have been the worst. In addition, the President is talking about our troops will be out in an estimated 1-year period of time. Again, go back to the point that these people have been fighting for hundreds of years now. How anyone can predict [[', 'Page H ', ""13793]] that our troops will have solved the problems over there, kept the peace and then pulled out in a year's period of time, I think that there is no way in the world that is going to happen. If our troops are pulled out, it is very likely that in a very short period of time the atrocities will start again, the fighting will start, and we are going to have the same type of chaos and death that we have over there now. So the 1-year period of time, I think, is a period of time that has been grabbed out of the air, and some would argue that it has to do with the fact that there is an election a year down the road. Who knows why the President picked 1 year. "", 'But I ', ""do not think there is any way we are going to be able to go over there and then suddenly peace is going to break out in that very dangerous part of the world after we have been there for a 1-year period of time. This is in Europe's backyard. It is very, very difficult for anybody to make the argument that this is in the vital interests of the United States. We have an interest to the extent that I think we think it was a good idea for the President to get the parties together. I think it is appropriate for us to play a role in getting people to talk about peace. I think we can play a role in supporting the Europeans through our air power, which we are able to project without great loss of life to American citizens. "", 'But I ', 'do not think that a legitimate argument can be made that it is necessary for U.S. troops to be at risk on the ground, and it does not take very long for anybody to pick out a couple of examples of the type of things which could very well happen in the very near future in that very dangerous part of the world. Look what happened in Lebanon. You know, it was something as unsophisticated as a truck filled with explosives to blow up a building and kill over 200 United States Marines in Beirut, Lebanon. In Somalia we went in with the best of intentions to feed people, and then mission creep set in. The goal got expanded. We were trying to build democracies over there. We got in the middle of the warlords. Our helicopters got shot down. American lives were lost, and the bodies of young Americans were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu. What we are trying to do here is to prevent the President from making a very, very tragic mistake. He certainly has not convinced me that this is in the vital interests of the United States to put United States troops on the ground in Bosnia. From the calls that I am receiving in my office every day, he certainly has not convinced the people of Cincinnati, the people that I represent, that this is the right action. The calls are overwhelmingly coming in that we should not put United States troops on the ground in ', 'Bosnia. I ', ""have talked to many, many of my colleagues here on both sides of the aisle, both Democrats and Republicans, and the calls are coming in from people all over this country, ``Don't do it. Don't put United States troops on the ground in Bosnia.'' The President apparently is determined to move ahead with this venture. I think he is making a terrible mistake. I wish he would listen to Congress, and I wish he would listen to the American people and, please, prevent this tragedy from happening. We do not need to lose American lives in "", 'Bosnia. I ', 'beg the President to reconsider this effort that he seems to be determined to make. I think it is a very tragic event. I hope I am wrong. I hope and pray that my concerns are unfounded and things will go well. ', 'But I ', 'am very, very concerned that I am right, and if that happens, we are going to have many, many Americans who lose their lives in that very dangerous part of the world. ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' I thank the gentleman for his excellent remarks. I yield to the gentleman from Washington [Mr. Metcalf]. ', 'Mr. METCALF.', "" I thank the gentleman for yielding. I just want to start out by saying this is under no circumstances a partisan issue. It makes no difference whatsoever and would not ever make a difference to me whether the President was Republican or Democrat on this kind of an issue. I listened really carefully to President Clinton's' speech, and I re- read the speech word for word just so I was certain what he said. The vital United States interests the President laid out in his speech were broad, universal interests and would apply to any trouble spot in the world. This is not satisfactory. I have said since I ran for Congress that I would support committing American troops only if vital, specific U.S. interests were involved, and the interests that he gave were not. "", 'Militarily, U.', 'S. troops are not needed. Our own Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff stated that Europe can handle the military aspect themselves. European powers have direct interest in Bosnia, and they should step up to the plate on this. Britain and France have done so and will be part of the operation as it is planned. You know, it is interesting, Germany had not pledged troops until today. I guess Germany remembers World ', 'War II,', ' when they occupied that area for several years during World ', 'War II.', "" They understand the problems there of an occupying nation, and it just seems to me that maybe their reason for not joining until today is that they understood better than we do some of the problems that are involved. The President promised that the troops in Haiti would be home in a year. Remember? It has now been 16 months, and the troops are still there. Why should we believe that Bosnia is different? One of the things that the President did say was he said he would provide a clear mission statement, a specific operational plan, what are the objectives, how will these troops accomplish the objectives, and what is the exit strategy. Thus far, and he said he would present that, and I assume that that is still coming. I am not being critical at all. We just do not have it yet. We certainly need it before we can make the judgment as to whether or not troops should be sent. Also we do not have the money to engage this operation. That is another very critical factor. We fight and work very hard to cut $2 million here or $12 million there from the budget. The estimate of the cost of this is $2.1 billion at the present time. Judging from all previous estimates that I have seen, you should multiply it at least by 2, so we are talking about, I believe, close to a $4 billion cost. Remember, this is money that we do not have. This is money that will have to be borrowed if we move into Bosnia. The idea of balancing the budget is absolutely critical, and there are circumstances certainly where we would go ahead and even if we had to borrow the money, but only if we are certain of what is going to happen, what is the vital U.S. interest that is involved, what is the plan to actually achieve the kind of peace we are looking for and set up the conditions by which we can exit. Those are the points that I see, and we will try to have an open mind and watch what the President comes up with for these things. As of now, from what I have seen, my vote would be an absolute ``no.'' I certainly hope and will do everything I can to see that we do get a vote on this in the House of "", 'Representatives. I ', 'think the Senate should also vote on whether or not to authorize troops, ground troops in Bosnia. ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', "" I say to the gentleman from Washington [Mr. Metcalf], I want to recommend a book to you on Mogadishu. On the cover is the picture of Durand's helicopter crew, the ones that were killed, Ray Frank, three full combat tours in Vietnam, big, handsome, blond David Cleveland, William, his mother called him David, the men called him William, like his father. He was one of the door gunners, and Tommy Fields, another door gunner. It is just called ``Mogadishu.'' It tells a story of a tragedy in the Clinton administration that he just put behind him. Let me ask you something, I say to the gentleman from Washington [Mr. Metcalf], there is a report from my district office today. The calls dropped to 100 for the first time. It is usually 200. Not a single person calling my district office, oh, they will call now, detractors and stuff. We are going to ignore their calls, and I have every right to be as tough as I want on this because I am the one who went to Mogadishu less than 10 days after the last man was killed there, to photograph this whole area.

The documents referred to are as follows: [From the Reader's Digest, October 1995] The Folly of U.N. Peacekeeping (By Dale Van Atta) Sonja's Kon-Tiki cafe is a notorious Serbian watering hole six miles north of Sarajevo. While Serb soldiers perpetrated atrocities in nearby Bosnian villages, local residents reported that U.N. peacekeepers from France, Ukraine, Canada and New Zealand regularly visited Sonja's, drinking and eating with these very same soldiers--and sharing their women. The women of Sonja's, however, were actually prisoners of the Serb soldiers. As one soldier, Borislav Herak, would later confess, he visited Sonja's several times a week, raping some of the 70 females present and killing two of them. U.N. soldiers patronized Sonja's even after a Sarajevo newspaper reported where the women were coming from. Asked about this, a U.N. spokesman excused the incident by saying no one was assigned to read the newspaper. "", 'The U.', ""N. soldiers who frequented Sonja's also neglected to check out the neighborhood. Less than 200 feet away, a concentration camp held Bosnian Muslims in inhuman conditions. Of 800 inmates processed, 250 disappeared and are presumed dead. Tragically, Sonja's Kon-Tiki illustrates much of what has plagued U.N. peacekeeping operations: incompetent commanders, undisciplined soldiers, alliances with aggressors, failure to prevent atrocities and at times even contributing to the horror. And the level of waste, fraud and abuse is overwhelming. Until recently, the U.N. rarely intervened in conflicts. When it did, as in Cyprus during the 1960s and '70s, it had its share of success. But as the Cold War ended, the U.N. became the world's policeman, dedicated to nation building as well as peacekeeping. By the end of 1991, the U.N. was conducting 11 peacekeeping operations at an annual cost of $480 million. In three years, the numbers rose to 18 operations and $3.3 billion--with U.S. taxpayers paying 31.7 percent of the bill. Have the results justified the steep cost? Consider the U.N.'s top four peacekeeping missions: bosnia In June 1991, Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia and was recognized by the U.N. The Serbian- dominated Yugoslav army invaded Croatia, ostensibly to protect its Serbian minority. After the Serbs agreed to a cease-fire, the U.N. sent in a 14,000-member U.N. Protection Force ("", 'UNPROFOR)', "" to build a new nation. (The mission has since mushroomed to more than 40,000 personnel, becoming the most extensive and expensive peacekeeping operation ever.) After neighboring Bosnia declared its independence in March 1992, the Serbs launched a savage campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' against the Muslims and Croats who made up 61 percent of the country's population. Rapidly the Serbs gained control of two-thirds of Bosnia, which they still hold. Bosnian Serbs swept into Muslim and Croat villages and engaged in Europe's worst atrocities since the Nazi Holocaust. Serbian thugs raped at least 20,000 women and girls. In barbed-wire camps, men, women and children were tortured and starved to death. Girls as young as six were raped repeatedly while parents and siblings were forced to watch. In one case, three Muslim girls were chained to a fence, raped by Serb soldiers for three days, then drenched with gasoline and set on fire. While this was happening, the "", 'UNPROFOR ', ""troops stood by and did nothing to help. Designated military ``observers'' counted artillery shells--and the dead. Meanwhile, evidence began to accumulate that there was a serious corruption problem. Accounting procedures were so loose that the U.S. overpaid $1.8 million on a $21.8 million fuel contract. Kenyan peacekeepers stole 25,000 gallons of fuel worth $100,000 and sold it to the Serbs. Corruption charges were routinely dismissed as unimportant by U.N. officials. Sylvana Foa, then spokesperson for the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva, said it was no surprise that ``out of 14,000 pimply 18-year-olds, a bunch of them should get up to hanky-panky'' like black-market dealings and going to brothels. When reports persisted, the U.N. finally investigated. In November 1993 a special commission confirmed that some terrible but ``limited'' misdeeds had occurred. Four Kenyan and 19 Ukrainian solders were dismissed from the U.N. force. The commission found no wrong-doing at Sonja's Kon-Tiki, but its report, locked up at U.N. headquarters and never publicly released, is woefully incomplete. The Sonja's Kon- Tiki incidents were not fully investigated, for example, because the Serbs didn't allow U.N. investigators to visit the site, and the soldiers' daily logbooks had been destroyed. Meanwhile, Russian troop commanders have collaborated with the Serb aggressors. According to U.N. personnel at the scene, Russian battalion commander Col. Viktor Loginov and senior officer Col. Aleksandr Khromchenkov frequented lavish feasts hosted by a Serbian warlord known as ``Arkan,'' widely regarded as one of the worst perpetrators of atrocities. It was also common knowledge that Russian officers directed U.N. tankers to unload gas at Arkan's barracks. During one cease- fire, when Serbian materiel was locked in a U.N. storage area, a Russian apparently gave the keys to the Serbs, who removed 51 tanks. Eventually, Khromchenkov was repatriated. Loginov, after finishing his tour of duty, joined Arkan's Serbian forces. Problems remained, however, under the leadership of another Russian commander, Maj. Gen. Aleksandr Perelyakin. Belgian troops had been blocking the movement of Serb troops across a bridge in northeastern Croatia, as required by U.N. Security Council resolutions. Perelyakin ordered the Belgians to stand aside. Reluctantly they did so, permitting one of the largest movements of Serbian troops and equipment into the region since the 1991 cease-fire. According to internal U.N. reports, the U.N. spent eight months quietly trying to pressure Moscow to pull Perelyakin back, but the Russians refused. "", 'The U.', ""N. finally dismissed him last April. cambodia In 1991, the United States, China and the Soviet Union helped broker a peace treaty among three Cambodian guerrilla factions and the Vietnamese-installed Cambodian government, ending 21 years of civil war. To ease the transition to Cambodia's first democratic government, the U.N. created the U.N. Transitional Authority in Cambodia ("", 'UNTAC)', "". In less than two years, about 20,000 U.N. peacekeepers and other personnel were dispatched at a cost of $1.9 billion. Some of the Cambodian ``peacekeepers'' proved to be unwelcome guests--especially a Bulgarian battalion dubbed the ``Vulgarians.'' In northwest Cambodia, three Bulgarian soldiers were killed for ``meddling'' with local girls. One Bulgarian was treated for 17 different cases of VD. The troops' frequent carousing once sparked a mortar-rifle battle with Cambodian soldiers at a brothel. The Bulgarians were not the sole miscreants in Cambodia, as internal U.N. audits later showed. Requests from Phnom Penh included 6500 flak jackets--and 300,000 condoms. In the year after the U.N. peacekeepers arrived, the number of prostitutes in Phnom Penh more than tripled. U.N. mission chief Yasushi Akashi waved off Cambodian complaints with a remark that ``18-year-old hot-blooded soldiers'' had the right to enjoy themselves, drink a few beers and chase ``young beautiful beings.'' He did post an order: ``Please do not park your U.N. vans near the nightclubs'' (i.e., whorehouses). At least 150 U.N. peacekeepers contracted "", 'AIDS ', 'in Cambodia; 5000 of the troops came down with VD. Meanwhile, more than 1000 generators were ordered, at least 330 of which, worth nearly $3.2 million, were never used for the mission. ', 'When U.', ""N. personnel started spending the $234.5 million budgeted for ``premises and accommodation,'' rental costs became so inflated that natives could barely afford to live in their own country. Some $80 million was spent buying vehicles, including hundreds of surplus motorcycles and minibuses. When 100 12-seater minibuses were needed, 850 were purchased--an ``administrative error,'' "", 'UNTAC ', 'explained, that cost $8.3 million. Despite the excesses, the U.N. points with pride to the free election that ', 'UNTAC ', ""sponsored in May 1993. Ninety percent of Cambodia's 4.7 million eligible voters defied death threats from guerrilla groups and went to the polls. Unfortunately, the election results have been subverted by the continued rule of the Cambodian People's Party--the Vietnamese-installed Communist government, which lost at the ballot box. In addition, the Khmer Rouge--the guerrilla group that butchered more than a million countrymen in the 1970s-- have refused to disarm and demobilize. So it was predictable that they would repeatedly break the ceasefire and keep up their killing. "", 'The U.', 'N. has spent nearly $2 billion, but there is no peace in Cambodia. somalia When civil war broke out in this African nation, the resulting anarchy threatened 4.5 million Somalis--over half the population--with severe malnutrition and related diseases. U.N. Secretary General Boutros [[', 'Page H ', '13795]] Boutros Ghali, the first African (and Arab) to hold the position, argued eloquently for a U.N. peacekeeping mission to ensure safe delivery of food and emergency supplies. ', 'The U.', 'N. Operation in Somalia (', 'UNOSOM)', ' was deployed to Mogadishu, the capital, in September 1992. It was quickly pinned down at the airport by Somali militiamen and was unable to complete its mission. A U.S. task force deployed in December secured the Mogadishu area, getting supplies to the hungry and ill. After the Americans left, the U.N. took over in May 1993 with ', 'UNOSOM II.', ' The $2-million-a-day operation turned the former U.S. embassy complex into an 80-acre walled city boasting air-conditioned housing and a golf course. ', 'When U.', ""N. officials ventured out of the compound, their ``taxis'' were helicopters that cost $500,000 a week. The published commercial rate for "", 'Mogadishu-U.', ""S. phone calls was $4.91 a minute, but the ``special U.N. discount rate'' was $8.41. Unauthorized personal calls totaled more than $2 million, but the U.N. simply picked up the tab and never asked the callers to pay. Meanwhile, the peacekeeping effort disintegrated, particularly as warlord Mohammed Aidid harassed "", 'UNOSOM II ', 'troops. As the civil war continued, Somalis starved. ', 'But U.', ""N. peacekeepers--on a food budget of $56 million a year--dined on fruit from South America, beef from Australia from frozen fish from New Zealand and the Netherlands. Thousands of yards of barbed wire arrived with no barbs; hundreds of light fixtures to illuminate the streets abutting the compound had no sockets for light bulbs. What procurement didn't waste, pilferage often took care of. Peacekeeping vehicles disappeared with regularity, and "", 'Egyptian U.', 'N. troops were suspected of large scale black-marketing of minibuses. These losses, however, were eclipsed in a single night by an enterprising thief who broke into a U.N. office in Mogadishu and made off with $3.9 million in cash. The office door was easy pickings: its lock could be jimmied with a credit card. The money, stored in the bottom drawer of a filing cabinet, had been easily visible to dozens of U.N. employees. While the case has not been solved, one administrator was dismissed and two others were disciplined. Last summer, ', 'UNOSOM II ', 'itself was shut down, leaving Somalia to the same clan warfare that existed when U.N. troops were first deployed two years before. ', 'RWANDA ', 'Since achieving independence in 1962, Rwanda has erupted in violence between the majority Hutu tribe and minority Tutsis. ', 'The U.', ""N. had a peacekeeping mission in that nation, but it fled as the Hutus launched a new bloodbath in April 1994. Only 270 U.N. troops stayed behind, not enough to prevent the butchery of at least 14 local Red Cross workers left exposed by the peacekeepers' swift flight. "", 'The U.', 'N. Security Council dawdled as the dead piled up, and a daily horror of shooting, stabbings and machete hackings. The Hutus were finally driven out by a Tutsi rebel army in late summer 1994. ', 'Seven U.', ""N. agencies and more than 100 international relief agencies rushed back. With a budget of some $200 million, the U.N. tried unsuccessfully to provide security over Hutu refugee camps in Rwanda and aid to camps in neighboring Zaire. The relief effort was soon corrupted when the U.N. let the very murderers who'd massacred a half million people take over the camps. Rather than seeking their arrest and prosecution, the U.N. made deals with the Hutu thugs, who parlayed U.N. food, drugs and other supplies into millions of dollars on the black market. Earlier this year the U.N. began to pull out of the camps. On April 22 at the Kibeho camp in Rwanda, the Tutsi-led military opened fire on Hutu crowds. Some 2000 Hutus were massacred. Where was the U.N.? Overwhelmed by the presence of nearly 2000 Tutsi soldiers, the 200 U.N. peacekeepers did nothing. A U.N. spokesman told Reader's Digest, meekly, that the U.N. was on the scene after the slaughter for cleanup and body burial. With peacekeeping operations now costing over $3 billion a year, reform is long overdue. Financial accountability can be established only by limiting control by the Secretariat, which routinely withholds information about peacekeeping operations until the last minute--too late for the U.N.'s budgetary committee to exercise oversight. In December 1993, for example, when the budget committee was given one day to approve a $600-million budget that would extend peacekeeping efforts into 1994, U.S. representative Michael Michalski lodged an official protest: ``"", 'If U.', ""S. government employees approved a budget for a similar amount with as little information as has been provided to the committee, they would likely be thrown in jail.'' More fundamentally, the U.N. needs to re-examine its whole peacekeeping approach, for the experiment in nation building has been bloody and full of failure. Lofty ideas to bring peace everywhere in the world have run aground on reality: member states with competing interests in warring territories, the impossibility of lightly armed troops keeping at bay belligerent enemies, and the folly of moving into places without setting achievable goals. ``It has been a fundamental error to put U.N. peacekeepers in place where there is no peace to keep,'' says Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), ranking minority member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``We've seen very vividly that the U.N. is not equipped, organized or financed to intervene and fight wars.'' ____ [From the Paris Match, Oct. 5, 1995] Our Pilots are Prisoners of the Serbs (Translated by David Skelly) Two tiny points in an incandescent sky. These images have been holding us in cruel suspense for nearly a month. The two points are two French officers, a captain pilot and a lieutenant navigator, shot down on August 30 in their Mirage 2000-K2, almost directly above Pale, the capital of the Bosnian Serbs, during the first "", 'NATO ', 'raid. Three exfiltration missions according to the ', 'CSAR ', '(combat, search and rescue procedure), which had succeeded in rescuing ', ""Captain O'"", ""Grady, failed. The Serbs have confirmed that they are holding two men alive, but no one, not even the Red Cross envoys has actually seen them. These photos reached us from Pale. Here are the faces of the two prisoners whom France has been anxiously waiting to see. The first scenes of their captivity. Peasants turned the lieutenant over to the `special forces commandos'. Being helped to walk by two Serbs from their special forces, Lieutenant Jose Souvignet seems to be suffering from a leg wound. Peasants turned the two airmen over to the ``specijali,'' who have been hiding them from the whole world ever since. The captain, Frederique Chiffot, snarls at his guards. Contrary to what happened with the American pilot, ours were brought down in broad daylight, above a mountain in an area with a high density of Serbian soldiers. Militiamen in the city of Pale were able to be there when they came down, and so it was impossible for the Frenchmen to escape. As soon as they hit ground they were captured and stripped of their warning, location, and survival equipment. Since these unique photos were taken, probably very shortly after their capture (in the foreground, a militiaman is still holding their helmets), they have probably been moved from their place of captivity, making it very difficult to exfiltrate them. According to rare Serbian information, it was thought that only Lieutenant Jose Souvignet had a leg wound. But here, Captain Frederique Chiffot, grimacing at the camera, also seems to be supported by members of the militia. Three attempts already: "", 'NATO ', 'is doing everything possible to free them. From September 5th to the 8th, three times over, ', 'NATO ', ""commandos have flown off in search of the two Frenchmen. These very complicated missions make use of airplanes and helicopters which have taken off from different bases, from Italian territory or the aircraft carrier ``Theodore Roosevelt.'' On board this ship, the Admiral Smith's general staff is coordinating, second by second, the delicate precision engineering of this warriors' ballet. The first attempt was completely American, but the weather was not on our side. The second and third attempts were French and American. Only the latter enabled the commandos to set down on a meadow near Pale. In vain. They had to withdraw under fire from the Serbs before having found the prisoners. When they were taken back up in the helicopter, two had been wounded. In the control room of the ``Theodore Roosevelt'' operations are being followed in real time. It was in an identical Mirage 2000 that the two pilots were brought down. Photos of the debris from the crash were widely disseminated in the press by the Serbs. ""]"

15,"BALANCING THE BUDGET AND TROOPS IN BOSNIA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of May 12, 1995, the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Gutknecht] is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Mr. Speaker, I want to first yield to the gentleman from the great State of Pennsylvania, the Keystone State [Mr. Fox]. We want to talk a little bit tonight about the budget, and then perhaps about the other big issue that I think Americans are concerned with, the issue of Bosnia. So I welcome Representative Fox, and maybe we can talk a little bit about how we got to where we are now and a little bit about the Balanced Budget Act. Mr. FOX of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the leadership the gentleman has taken here in the 104th Congress in focusing our attention on balancing the budget. Mr. Speaker, this is probably the most important issue we have before us, to make sure that we can reduce the cost of government, eliminate the waste, the fraud, and the abuse, and get down to the services that the Federal Government should be taking care of. The fact that we have not balanced the budget since 1969 has given us approximately a $5 trillion debt, and we are paying for that every day, every man, woman, and child in the United States. It has been told to us by no less [[Page H 14149]] than Alan Greenspan, Congressman Gutknecht, that if we in fact come to a balanced budget within 7 years, we will not only increase the number of jobs in the United States by about 200,000 or 300,000, but we will as well reduce the cost of home mortgage payments, we will reduce car payments and, as well, reduce the cost of college loans. I think that is a pretty significant way to helping everyone in America, whether it be seniors, working families and children, making sure they can realize the American dream. I yield back. Mr. GUTKNECHT. I think we should talk a little bit about how we got to where we are. You and I were both elected last November as members of this freshman class, and I think it is important sometimes to reflect back on what the American people were saying a little over 12 months ago. I think what they were really saying is that they understand that the Federal Government has grown too big, it spends too much, it wastes too much of their tax dollars, and they want the Federal Government to be put on a diet. I think they fundamentally believe, and that is what my constituents still are telling me, that it is time to make the Federal Government do what every family has to do, what every business has had to do. In fact, if you look at every major corporation, every minor corporation, every small corporation, every small business, every single day they have to figure out ways to be more efficient. But that is not true of the Federal Government. Mr. Speaker, the first chart I want to show, and I am sure you are familiar with it as well, Representative Fox, is what the President originally proposed in terms of his, quote, ``balanced budget plan.'' Now, this is what the 10-year balanced budget plan would have produced in terms of deficits for as far as the eye could see. This is scored by the Congressional Budget Office, and I think that is the source that the President recommended a few years ago that we use, and the reason is, the CBO has historically been more accurate, more conservative, than any of the other sources which score some of our budget proposals. As you can see, in the year 1996, his proposal would have produced a $196 billion deficit; in 1997, $212 billion; in 1998, $199 billion; in the year 1999, $213 billion; 2000, $220 billion; 2001, $211 billion; 2002, $210 billion, and on out to the year 2005, over $209 billion, over $200 billion deficits literally for as far as the eye could see. That is not what I think the American people wanted when they asked us to balance the budget. I do not think they meant a 10-year plan which creates almost an additional $2 trillion worth of debt. Perhaps you want to talk a little bit about what the American people have said and what this plan said. Mr. FOX of Pennsylvania. I think the American public made it very clear, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike, that in fact what they want is a balanced budget. They have to balance their budget, the schools do, the States do, as you said earlier. Congressman Gutknecht, I know when you were in Minnesota, you had to balance the budget in the State government when you served there in the State legislature. The fact is, on Monday, November 20, Congressman Gutknecht, the President finally agreed to balance the budget in 7 years with honest numbers from the Congressional Budget Office. The President said at that time that he agreed with the Congress to do as follows: The President and the Congress shall enact legislation in the first session of the 104th Congress to achieve a balanced budget not later than the year 2002, as estimated by CBO, and the President and the Congress agreed that the balanced budget must protect future generations, ensure Medicare solvency, reform welfare, and provide adequate funding for Medicaid, education, agriculture, national defense, veterans, and the environment. Further, the balanced budget shall adopt tax policies to help working families and to stimulate future economic growth. Yet despite all of that on November 20, today, just 2 weeks later, or less than 2 weeks, the President vetoed a balanced budget bill. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Now, Representative Fox, it seemed to me like you were reading something there. Was that an actual agreement that was signed? Mr. FOX of Pennsylvania. Yes, it was. Mr. GUTKNECHT. More importantly, I think, as I understand that, that was actually signed into law. So that is not a campaign promise, that is actually a Federal law. Am I correct in that? Mr. FOX of Pennsylvania. Yes, you are correct in that, Congressman Gutknecht. What he said, his commitment was detailed in a continuing resolution to fund the Federal Government to December 15. Mr. GUTKNECHT. So now we have a law, a Federal law, which is a commitment by the President and this Congress to work together to produce a 7-year balanced budget plan, scored by CBO. What were some of the other things that you mentioned, some language that provides adequate funding for what? Mr. FOX of Pennsylvania. For Medicare and for welfare, for adequate funding for Medicaid, for education, agriculture, veterans programs, and the environment. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Well, we all support that, and I think we can do that with the budget we proposed that the President vetoed today that calls for spending almost $12.1 trillion over the next 7 years. Let me point out something else, Representative Fox, and I think you are probably aware of this. But right at the bottom of this chart it also points out that the President's plan was offered for a vote in the Senate, and it got zero votes. As a matter of fact, it was defeated 96 to zero. To their credit, some of our colleagues here in the House offered their own budget alternative, and I do give them credit for that. They went to an awful lot of work to put together a budget alternative to ours. Unfortunately, it only got 73 votes. As you and I both know, one of the critical ingredients in terms of actually structuring a budget and putting it together is, you have to get at least 218 votes in the House and 51 votes in the Senate; otherwise, you are really just sort of whistling in the wind. It really does not make any difference. Unfortunately, our colleagues in the coalition in the House only got 73 votes for theirs. What we have put together, and I think it is important that we understand this, is not only have we put together a balanced budget plan which meets the CBO test, which actually balances the budget in 7 years or less, but we were able to get 218 votes in the House and 51 votes in the Senate. So we passed the two most important hurdles. Mr. FOX of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, the fact is that you have been working and struggling and hoping that we can get this bipartisan support, and I think we will eventually, because I think the American people are now saying, they want a balanced budget. They want the Federal services that the Government can provide where the States cannot take care of them better. What is surprising under that Republican plan that was sent to the President, Medicare spending would total $1.6 trillion, $724 billion more than was spent during the previous 7 years, a 63-percent increase. {time} 2030 When it comes to welfare, the Republican plan would have welfare spending total $878 billion during the next 7 years, $386 billion more than was spent during the last 7 years, a 78 percent increase. Under Medicaid, the Republican plan gives States $791 billion in grant assistance over the next 7 years. That is $358 billion more than was spent during the previous 7 years, a 79 percent increase. On education, under our plan the amount of money available for student loans increases nearly 50 percent during the next 7 years, rising from $24 billion in 1995 to $36 billion in 2002, and the number of student loans will increase from 6.6 million in 1995 to 7.1 million in 1996, the most ever made available. Mr. GUTKNECHT. I want the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Fox] and I to come back to those numbers, but before we do, I want to go back to this basic point, the commitment to a 7-year balanced budget plan. I want to read this quote again for the Members who are watching in their offices and perhaps Americans who are [[Page H 14150]] watching at home: ``The President and the Congress shall.'' It does not say ``ought to,'' or ``it would be a good idea'' or ``may.'' It says, ``The President and the Congress shall enact legislation in the first session,'' that means before we start next year, ``of the 104th Congress to achieve a balanced budget not later than the fiscal year 2002 as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.'' That is a direct quote. That is what the agreement was. That is what the President signed and, most important, that is currently Federal law. I guess it is good news and bad news. The bad news is the President vetoed our attempt today at that plan. We had a plan that we felt very good about, that we felt we could defend. It met the CBO test and it met the vote test and we were able to get the votes to pass it here in the House. That is the bad news, that he vetoed our plan today. The good news, though, is I think the President now is serious. I think the reason he is serious, as the late Senator from Illinois used to say, the late Everett Dirksen, ``The more I feel the heat, the more I see the light.'' I think the President is beginning to feel the heat and I think the administration understands that the American people want us to balance the budget in 7 years. There is another important point that I think the American people want. The more I hear from the American people, the more I hear them saying they also want that tax relief, because they understand very, very well what it could mean to them and their families if the $500- per-child tax credit passes. To many families, the average family with almost three children, let us say the average family with three kids in my district or your district, that is an extra $1,500 in their pockets every year, cash that they can spend to do some home improvements, to buy a new automobile, to take the kids on a vacation, a fishing vacation of some kind, or just to invest and save for the future for the kids' education. So that $500 per child tax credit, people understand very, very clearly. Mr. FOX of Pennsylvania. Let me add to that, I agree with the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Gutknecht]. Beyond that, the tax reform that we have adopted in the House, and hopefully will be adopted by the President as well and signed into law, a joint bill from the Senate and the House, will in fact also give us some other items that are important. It will give us the opportunity for the first time to have a new IRA for $2,000 for individuals, $4,000 for couples, an elder care tax credit, a capital gains tax reduction for individuals of 19 percent, for businesses 28 percent, which will give the infusion of more savings, new jobs, expansion of businesses. It will help our seniors by rolling back the 1993 tax increase on Social Security benefits, together with the opportunity for seniors to earn more. Right now seniors under 70 are capped at $11,280, that they will have deductions from Social Security. But with the new law we just adopted here in the House, seniors will be able to earn up to $30,000 a year without those deductions from their Social Security. Mr. GUTKNECHT. I think seniors can understand that. In fact, I met with one the other day working at a Wal-Mart store in Mankato. Her name is Muriel. If you stop and think about it, in effect Muriel is paying among the highest tax rates of anybody in the United States. As a matter of fact, there is a very good chance that Muriel is paying a higher tax rate than Ross Perot and some of the wealthiest Americans. The American people are not completely confident that we are going to be able to follow through on our promise to balance this budget in 7 years. They hope we do, they think we should, but the one thing they can understand is if next year they actually get this $500 per child tax credit. Let us talk a little bit, and perhaps the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Fox] wants to talk about this chart as well, where the benefits really go, because some of our colleagues on the other side have attempted to sort of distort this issue and to explain that, well, this is a tax cut for the rich. I wonder if we could talk a little bit about this chart and where the benefits really go. Perhaps you want to share some of those ideas. Mr. FOX of Pennsylvania. The fact is there are so many families who will benefit if this does get adopted. I wish you would explain to our colleagues on the floor tonight and those in their offices just what the percentages are, because the poster is closer to you. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Let me just explain what this chart says. This is according to the Heritage Foundation, and they got the information from us. The truth of the matter is that 89 percent of the benefit will go to families earning less than $75,000 a year. Let me repeat that. Eighty- nine percent of the benefit, of the $500-per-child tax credit, will go to families with incomes of less than $75,000 a year. If you look at it, only 4 percent will go to families earning more than $100,000 a year, and only 7 percent will to families earning between $75,000 and $100,000. The truth of the matter is when you talk about this per-child family tax credit of $500, the overwhelming bulk of the benefit goes to average middle-class families, and that is the people we believe deserve the relief. As a matter of fact, you may have heard us talk about it before, that in 1950 the average family was sending about 3 percent of their gross income to the Federal Government. Today that number is up to 24.5 percent of their gross revenues are going to the Federal Government. Families are the ones who need the tax relief the most. So what we are proposing is saying we believe, and I think the American people understand this better than the people here in Washington do, but we happen to believe that families can spend that money much more efficiently than the Federal Government. Let us allow them to keep more of their revenue, let them keep more of their income and spend it themselves, because they are the ones who know how to spend it the most efficiently. As this chart underscores, even more important than anything I have seen is that the overwhelming amount of the benefit is going to go to middle and lower middle income families. We believe that is a good thing and, more importantly, the American people can understand this chart even better than the experts here in Washington. I would like to welcome the gentleman from Las Vegas, NV [Mr. Ensign], the former Speaker of the House, to join us in this debate. Mr. ENSIGN. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for yielding. I serve on the Committee on Ways and Means. We had a lot of debate this year about tax cuts. I am sure, as many of my colleagues in the freshman class, when we were out on the campaign trail last year there were a lot of us that were told by the American people that they feel this weight and this tremendous burden of the Federal Government, and this debt that they feel on them. They feel that more and more the working middle class is bearing this tremendous debt load, that career politicians that have been unable and unwilling to say no to the special interest groups have continued to put on them. If we think back to the 1950's, and especially seniors remember this, the average family of four back in the 1950's paid about $1 out of $50 to the Federal Government. Today the average, just the average income family of four, pays about $1 out of $4 to the Federal Government. The reason is, it has to do with what is happening with your chart, and that is that the personal exemption did not keep pace with inflation. If you look at virtually everything across the board, whether you are talking about a carton of milk or a loaf of bread or cars or houses, if you adjust for inflation, they all cost pretty much the same. Their earning dollars pretty much buy them the same thing they bought back in the 1950's. The difference between the 1950's and today is the tax burden. That is the reason in a two-parent family that when one of the parents, especially when the children are young--and I just had a little girl that was born on Saturday. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Have you named her yet? Mr. ENSIGN. Yes, her name is Sienna. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Sienna. Did you tell her about the debt she inherited when she was born? [[Page H 14151]] Mr. ENSIGN. It is $187,000 this year. I try not to politicize my daughter's birth this year. Fortunately, I am in an income category where my wife has chosen to stay home with the kids for the first 4 or 5 years of their life. We are fortunate to be in an income category to be able to afford that. It used to be in the 1950's that the average income family could afford, in a two-parent family, if either the husband or the wife wanted to stay home and stay with the kids and nurture those kids, especially during those formative years, they could afford to do that. But today they cannot afford to do it, and it is not that they do not earn enough money. It is that the tax burden is too high, and that is one of the things that this $500 per child tax credit will do. Mr. GUTKNECHT. That is basically what has happened in the last 30 or 40 years, is the Federal Government has grown in its influence over our daily lives and the family has actually diminished. What we are trying to do is reinforce families, because we know that the cornerstone of the western civilization is strong families. So this is something that I feel--and you hate to always speak for the freshman class, I know you are a member of the class and the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Fox] is a member of the freshman class--but I think this is something we feel very, very strongly about. We are willing to negotiate in good faith with the President and the administration. But in terms of ever giving up on the $500-per-child tax credit, I think it is one thing that I hope that our class and members of this side of the aisle will fight to the bitter end, because I think this is something the American people can understand. It is going to mean cash in their pockets. It is going to mean money that they get to spend rather than sending it to Washington, and I think that is really what the American people want. I think they want us to downsize the Federal Government. They know it is inefficient, and frankly they are correct. The more I have been here, the more I have realized just how incredibly inefficient this Federal Government is, and the most efficient spender of resources in this country is the American family. Why should we not allow them to keep more of their money and spend it themselves? Mr. ENSIGN. If the gentleman will yield, one of the things, this $245 billion number has been just demagogued to death because they talk about this huge tax cut. Over the next 7 years, under the Republican proposal, we are going to spend about $12.2 trillion. If you think about $1 trillion, to get to $1 trillion, if you had a business that lost $1 million a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, you would have to have that business start at the time of Christ, till now, plus another almost 700 years to get to $1 trillion. Mr. GUTKNECHT. So if you spent $1 million a day 365 days a year from the time of Christ until now. Mr. ENSIGN. Plus 700 years. To get to $1 trillion. In the last 7 years, the Federal Government spent a little over $9 trillion. Under the Republican proposal that you hear about all these cuts, we are going to spend a little over $12 trillion. President Clinton wants to spend almost $13 trillion. So the difference is not in whether we are cutting anything. The difference is whether we are going to increase Federal spending by $3 trillion or $4 trillion. The reason I bring up those numbers, because they are so staggering and they are so hard to think about, is the dollars. These are tax, that is all that is, that is money raised from taxes. The $245 billion is less than 2 percent of the $12.2 trillion. That is what we are talking about. We are only talking about cutting taxes by 2 percent. Mr. GUTKNECHT. So all of these tax cuts that we are hearing demagogued every day on the House floor represents only 2 percent of all the Federal spending over the next 7 years? Mr. ENSIGN. Staggering numbers. That is why if we could just be honest with the American people, and I am sure you heard during your campaign, why can they not be honest with what they are telling us from Washington. Forget about this political spin, just be honest. If we can go to Medicare and tell people, and when you do this, the light bulb just goes off, they say, ``Why are they saying that?'' In Medicare, the total spending in Medicare over the last 7 years was a little over $900 billion, almost $1 trillion. The next 7 years under the Republican proposal, we will spend a little over $1.6 trillion. It is over $700 billion more. Not less. More. I know the educational system is not what it once was, but still, when you spend $700 billion more we still call that addition, and I still think they call that addition today. This is what certain people in this Congress are calling a cut, is $700 billion more spending. I think the chart you have up there talks about some of the premiums, the part B premiums. That is the part that does to doctors. Part A trust fund is the part that goes to hospitals. Part B premiums and part B of the Medicare part is the part that goes to doctors. Why do you not explain a little bit about the differences between the Republican proposal and the Clinton proposal. {time} 2045 Mr. GUTKNECHT. I think it is important and instructive, and one of my favorite quotes is from John Adams, one of the Founders of this great country, and he said that facts are stubborn things, and that sort of is what we have been talking about is let us get the facts out there. Interestingly enough, we just got back a rather in-depth poll. I do not think you should make public policy based upon polls. I think it does confirm instinctively what all of us believe; that is, if the American people are given facts, they overwhelmingly support what we are doing. As a matter of fact, the interesting thing is there was a separate poll we did a couple of weeks ago when they asked the American people essentially some of the questions that are being posed by some of the other national polling media outlets; for example, do you think the Republicans are cutting Medicare too much? Not surprising, a majority of Americans said ``yes.'' But when we explain to them in our poll what the numbers really were and that we were actually increasing total Medicare spending from something like $189 billion a year to $278 billion a year over only 7 years per year and---- Mr. ENSIGN. And per person. Mr. GUTKNECHT. On a per capita basis, per recipient spending actually increases from $4,800 a year this year to $7,000 a year. The interesting thing is when you tell the American people that, in one poll we did a few weeks ago, 63 percent, after they learned that information, after they heard the facts, they said you are increasing spending too much on Medicare. So I think once we get our side of the story told, what this chart basically demonstrates is, while the administration has been demagoging to a certain degree, our Medicare part B premiums plan, the truth of the matter is, if you extend it out to the seventh year, we are really only talking about a difference between our plan and the President's plan of $4.80 a year. Now, that is almost nothing. Mr. ENSIGN. The difference between the President's plan and our plan, how many years does that save Medicare? We save Medicare to what year versus what? Mr. GUTKNECHT. With this chart, we are only talking about part B. When you are talking about the part A trust funds, when you start talking about the trust funds, we are talking about saving the Medicare system from imminent bankruptcy, which the trustees of the Medicare trust fund came out earlier in April and told us that there is a drastic---- Mr. ENSIGN. The Medicare trustees, who are they appointed by? Mr. GUTKNECHT. Appointed by the President; I think three members of his own Cabinet. Mr. ENSIGN. He appoints every single member of the trustees, as I recall? Mr. GUTKNECHT. I believe that is correct. The point is they have no interest in telling us anything than the truth. What they said was, unless the Congress gets serious about reforming the Medicare system, it is going to go bankrupt in 7 years. It will not be able to make the payments. I think everyone now acknowledges there is a serious problem. Again, we have advanced a plan which uses market-based reforms, which I think the American people can understand. [[Page H 14152]] Essentially, one of the reasons they did not like the Clinton health care reform plans that came out a year and a half ago was they did not really believe the Federal Government could do a much more efficient job of running the health delivery system than the private sector. What we did was sort of change the whole notion. Let us see if we can use the things working so well in the private sector to help control costs in Medicare. I am absolutely confident our reform plans are going to work. More important than that, I am convinced seniors who decide to participate in some of these new Medicare-plus programs that we are putting together and allowing to operate, I think, in the end of just a few years, many of them are going to say, ``Yes, I like this plan much better than what we had before,'' because they are going to have options, they are going to have choices, they are going to be treated like human beings, just like everybody else out there. Mr. ENSIGN. You received just recently, like I did, like virtually every other Member of Congress and every Federal employee did during this enrollment period now, where we decide by January which plan we are going to have; I am holding up a card here and this card is a Blue Cross/Blue Shield card. You have the same card. Over 90 percent of the Members of the House of Representatives have this card. The Speaker of the House has this very same card. What we are talking about here is something called a PPO. Seniors in the United States today do not have the same option to choose the health insurance that you and I have to choose, the same as the Speaker of the House has to choose. What we are doing, and, by the way, a PPO is managed care. The vast majority of Americans do not understand that a PPO is actually managed care. It is a very good managed care. We are going to give the seniors options to be able to choose a PPO, just like you and I have the option each year to choose a PPO, and HMO, fee-for-service, medical savings accounts or these new things called provider sponsor organizations. Can you imagine, imagine this scenario, let us say we had all of those options currently in Medicare, can you imagine what would happen, what AARP would say to Members of Congress if we took a whole list of options that seniors had and now tried to reverse it and say no, no, no, we have got a better system for you; instead of having all of those options and all of those things, you can choose from each year, we are going to give you fee-for-service; in a couple of areas of the country we will give you HMOs. That is all you get. Can you imagine the uproar? Mr. GUTKNECHT. They would not stand for it. Mr. ENSIGN. We would have 34 million seniors marching on Washington tomorrow. That is exactly, I mean, if people think about it in that context, we are giving them more choices, more freedoms. The chart you hold up is only people that stay in fee-for-service, and the people that choose PPOs, many of them will actually have less out-of-pocket expenses because they will not have, or these companies will be able to pay their Medicare part B premiums. They may get prescription drug coverage. I have three grandmothers on Medicare. It is absolutely heartbreaking. Luckily, I am able to help some of my grandmothers, with different members of our family help, and sometimes if it was not for that, they would have to choose between what they ate that month and getting prescription drugs. Many seniors are in this same boat. What we want to do is be able to offer seniors in all parts of the country so many choices they will have that option so they do not have to make the choice between what they eat that month and between getting prescription drugs. So I think we just have to put the politics aside. Who cares whether it is Democrats, whether it is Republicans? We have to put the politics aside and do what is right for this country. Mr. GUTKNECHT. The American people, I think, understand this. In fact, when you talk about health care reform, if you look at what has happened in the private sector over the last number of years, we have literally seen the reforms with the various kinds of managed care and much more sophisticated kinds of managed care which are doing an incredibly good job of controlling the growth in health care costs. As a matter of fact, in the State of Minnesota, where we have probably more managed care than virtually any other State in the Union, we have seen health care costs over the last 18 months increasing at only about 1.1 percent. If you look at the private or at the public sector side, if you look at Medicare or Medicaid, we have had health care inflation at a rate of 10.5 percent. So the truth of the matter is we absolutely know that managed care will work. It will help control costs. But more important than that, in the State of Minnesota, we had a study that was done where they interviewed over 17,000 recipients of health care and asked them about how satisfied they were with their health care, and the interesting thing was among seniors who were already in some kind of managed care, their satisfaction with the plan that they have is 3 times greater than those who were in the standard Medicare fee-for-service plan. So it is not just about saving costs. It is not just about squeezing out some of the waste and mismanagement which we know is there. I think the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Fox] has done more to study the whole issue of waste, fraud and abuse in the health care system than anybody. I think if you create these managed care systems and create competition out there, we are going to attack that waste, fraud and abuse so we have more health care for fewer dollars. Mr. FOX of Pennsylvania. I appreciate your leadership as well as the gentleman from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] as well as the gentleman from California [Mr. Cunningham]. We can achieve savings we want by making sure we attack for the first time that health care fraud. Medicare fraud is $30 billion a year. By getting that savings, by offering choice, reducing paperwork costs and making sure we have an efficient system, health care will be preserved for our seniors under Medicare, and we can balance the budget, and I know that the gentleman from California [Mr. Cunningham] from his own experience can tell us about parts of the balanced budget amendment and the Balanced Budget Act that relates to his district, if he could join us in this discussion for that purpose. Mr. GUTKNECHT. He is not a freshman, but we will allow him in on this debate, the gentleman from San Diego, CA [Mr. Cunningham]. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. If you remember, it was our freshman class when I went aboard 5 years ago that had the gang of 7 that closed down the House bank, that found out they were selling cocaine downstairs here, and brought the check scandal to fruition. I think it was the first radical group to come in to make change, and the sophomore class followed, and the 75 young Turks that came in after that have done a bang-up job. I thank you for yielding, and one of the things I would like to talk to is that, you know, some of the more radical Members on the other side of the aisle say that, well, we are cutting education, we are cutting the environment, we are cutting, hurting senior citizens. Unfortunately, this place is about power. It is about the power to be reelected. The power to be reelected over the last 40 years means the power to disburse money from the Federal Government down to the lower ranks so they are going to vote for you so you can get reelected so that you have got the power, and to support that you need the big bureaucracy to support the flow of the money so you can get reelected so you have got the power. What we are doing, and I think the American people would have a legitimate complaint if this Congress and the Republicans were trying to shift that power to the Republican Party, but the whole agenda and a balanced budget amendment and the agenda that we are trying to do is take that power not to Republicans but to the American people, to the States, where it can be more effectively used. We believe that government works closest to the people and it works best there. [[Page H 14153]] You will hear over and over and over again by more liberal Members from Congress here that this is the only place that those decisions can be made. The States cannot make those decisions because in the past they have failed and that they are the only ones that can tell the American people how to do their business. That is a good issue. Mr. GUTKNECHT. That is so important because I think there is sort of this argument that if we do not do the spending, if we do not do the regulating, if we do not do not the controlling, it will not get done. This is not a debate about how much money is going to be spent on education, how much money is going to be spent on nutrition or how much is going to be spent on health care. This is really a fundamental debate about who going to do the spending and who can do it more efficiently. Wht we are really talking about, as you say, you said it so well, is returning more of that decisionmaking back to the States and, more importantly, wherever possible and with the $500 per child tax credit, giving it back to the families because families are much more efficient than local governments, and local governments are much more efficient than State governments, and State governments are far more efficient than Federal Governments. That is why we are talking about welfare reform. We need to talk a little more about that because, again, I think the American people are so far out in front of us it is not even funny. I think they know the welfare system that has been created, controlled, directed, and regulated by the Federal Government has been an abysmal failure. They do not have to go very far in any direction, particularly if they come to this city, to see the results of 30 years of the social welfare state. As a matter of fact, here in Washington, DC, if we go 10 blocks literally in any direction from this Capitol, you will see the results of 30 years of the social welfare state, and the results are devastating and not just in terms of the total costs. We all know we have spent over $5 trillion over the last 30 years, but the real cost is in the human cost because we have replaced self-reliance and families with debt, dependency and despair, and that is what the American people want changed. They know the real way is to send it back to the States through block grants to allow local communities and local individuals to help those who need the help. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Let me be very specific. I would like, Mr. Speaker, for you to listen to these figures because they are accurate and they are important in this debate. The Federal Government only supports 7 percent of education funding, 7 percent. 93 percent of all education is paid for out of State tax dollars. Now, of that 7 percent that we send to States, it occupies over 50 percent of the rules and regulations and burden on the State itself. It represents 75 percent of the paperwork that the State and the schools have to go through that tie up portions of the 93 cents that comes out of the State tax dollars. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Say that again. I think that needs to be repeated. That it is a powerful set of statistics. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. It is. It is very accurate. It is accurate for any State you go into. We happen to have one in eight Americans lives in the State of California. It is the same for any one of the States. The Federal Government only provides 7 percent of the funding for education. 93 percent, or 93 cents out of every dollar, comes out of the State. But yet of that 7 cents, 50 percent of the rules and regulations that tie up the State comes out of that 7 percent of funding from the Federal Government, 75 percent of the paperwork, and by getting back, and for example, my colleague says, well, you look, you cut out Goals 2000, you cut out all the funds for Goals 2000, what a great program. Well, if I send the money directly to the State and the State likes Goal 2000, the Governors have told us they can do a Goals 2000 program much more efficiently. They do not have the Federal rules and regulations, and they will argue, well, it is all voluntary. In the Goals 2000 bill there are 48 instances that say ``States will,'' and requires reporting, requires paperwork, and guess what, on the other end it takes Federal bureaucrats to take in that information, to record it and so on. My wife is a principal. She has to write grants for Goals 2000, and they receive some of the dollars. Many of the schools set up and hire people to write grants. They do not get the dollars, in most cases. Even in the cases they do, quite often, if it is not a larger school, the amount of dollars they get is not as much as it costs to pay the grant writer and to perform the rules and the regulations and the paperwork that comes back to Washington, DC. {time} 2100 So when they say we are cutting, we are actually providing more dollars and more efficiency to the States. And those savings; guess what? Those savings go to balance the budget, and in the case of the education bill, Mr. Speaker, some of those savings went up to NIH for medical research on AIDS, and heart disease, and some of the things that I believe most people in America believe are of national interest and that the Federal Government is the one that can host. So I get kind of upset when they say that we are cutting education, and they say I think the gentleman covered the student finances and the student loans. We are providing more money for student loans than ever in the history. But guess where the savings come from? The President's bill on direct lending, and I would like to give you, Mr. Speaker, some accurate figures as well, if I can find them here, that what the costs of the President's direct lending costs us. The President asks, or the President's costs, cost $1 billion over the next 7 years more than private student loans, $1 billion for the direct loan period, and guess what? CBO and OMB have not even calculated what it costs to collect those loans. That is just the distribution of it. So when we say---- Mr. GUTKNECHT. That is just the overhead. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Just the overhead, $1 billion more than sending it to the private enterprises, but yet our colleagues say, well, that is only for the rich, that is for your loan guys, and that is for your banks. Well, I can do something cheaper and better and provide more loans to the students that really need them, and the Pell grants which have been increased higher than any other level in the time of history, then I think that is better, instead again of having the Federal Government up here being able to dole out the money, and guess what? That direct student loan program, the President wanted billions more dollars to increase it by fourscore, and that would make the Department of Education the biggest lending entity in the world, I mean other than the World Bank, and that is what they want. They want that power of the Federal dollars to come down so that they can say, well, look at the grant that I gave you here. But they forget one thing, Mr. Speaker. They forget where the money came from in the first place. It is not their money. They take if from the very people, send it up here, and let me give you another accurate figure, Mr. Speaker, and this is one for my colleague to remember also. Only 23 cents out of every dollar that comes to Washington gets back into the classroom, 23 cents on every dollar. Mr. GUTKNECHT. That is a pretty poor return on the investment. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Only 30 cents in welfare gets down to the recipients that really need the welfare check because of all the bureaucracy. Now my colleagues on the other side of the aisle or this side of the aisle, or the American public, you cannot run a business like that, and what the Governors have come to us and said is let us have the dollars, you do not want children to go hungry, you want the needy to be taken care of, you want the help. But you have got 144-some welfare programs, you have got 250 education programs. Let us set our own State standards, give us the money, do away with the Federal requirements and the bureaucracy, and we can make it more efficient. And guess what? We can apply those savings to the deficit and reduce, and what you have been talking about, what Alan Greenspan said, is that interest rates have already come down 2 percent. Why? Because the lending institutions for the first time in over 40 years believe that Congress is serious about [[Page H 14154]] balancing the budget, and if that expectation goes away, those interest rates would not only go back to where they were, they will spiral upward and upward, and then look what it costs for a student loan in the increased interest. Look what it costs for a home with increased interest. I do not know about you, but most Americans, when interest rates came down, they refinanced their home, and I would encourage you, Mr. Speaker, if you have not done it already, take a serious look because it is going to be cheaper on your payments, and what does that mean? It means more dollars in the pockets of the American people. And these are some of the things on education, and I have a special order later tonight that I want to go through in depth some of these same issues on education and go through grant by grant, loan by loan, education bill and education program by education program and show what we have really done. If you say cut at a Federal level, yes, I will zero out any program I can at a Federal level and pass it on down to the State because I think and believe from the bottom of my heart it is much more efficient, it is closer to the people, and they can decide better where those dollars will be used, and I think that is what we are trying to do here. Mr. GUTKNECHT. The examples you have given, Congressman Cunningham, are so good, and frankly I think the American people instinctively understand just what you have talked about tonight. They understand that what we really need to do is localize, and privatize, and downsize this Federal Government, and that is what we are trying to do, and when they talk about cuts in education, we are talking about moving more of that educational decisionmaking back to the States, local units, and to families where they can make their own decisions about what they are going to do with their kids and the schools that they have, and frankly I think every American family understands this. They care much more about their kids' education than some bureaucrat in Washington. You know we can all talk about caring, and everybody talks about compassion, but real caring and real compassion happens around the kitchen table. It is families that care most about their kids' education, and that is what we want to get back to, and the waste and mismanagement here in this city, as I say, is just awesome, and I know you are going to talk a little bit about Bosnia, and I want to hear a little more, and I see Congressman Dornan is here tonight as well to talk a little bit about military affairs, and I believe in a strong defense, but just look at the Defense Department and the amount of waste, and duplication, and mismanagement that we see, and I know that your other colleague from San Diego once told me, Congressman Hunter, about how many buyers they have at the Pentagon. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Congressman who? Mr. GUTKNECHT. Hunter. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Congressman who? Mr. GUTKNECHT. Congressman Duncan Hunter. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Congressman who? Mr. GUTKNECHT. Duncan Hunter. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. He told me to mention his name three times. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Why? The duck comes down and you win 50 bucks? But he talked about how may buyers, and it is like 106,000 buyers in the Department of Defense. We have 1,646 buyers for every F-16 we buy, and we buy 1 or 2 a week, something like that, and it is replete throughout the Federal Government. We all know that, the people that we serve know that, and the interesting thing, and we talked a little bit earlier about the megapoll that we did; it just confirms, I think, the common sense we all have, and that is once the American people understand what we are doing, once they see how much we are actually going to be spending, if anything the criticism is that we are still spending too much. Our budget calls for almost $12.1 trillion worth of spending over the next 7 years, and if you divide that up, it works out to over $46,500 in Federal spending for every man, woman, and child in the United States. Let me say that again. Over the next 7 years, Mr. Speaker, our budget plan, which the President vetoed today as cutting too much, will spend $46,500 for every man, woman, and child in the United States. Now what we are saying, I think in very simple language, we believe the $12.2 trillion is more than enough to fund the legitimate needs of this Federal Government and to take care of those people who depend on the Federal Government for various services; $12.1 trillion is more than enough. $13 trillion will bust the bank, and it will bust the taxpayers. In fact I think, if we can get the American people to look more at the facts of our budget, I think they will come to the same conclusion that we have come to, and that is that our budget is fair, it is reasonable, it is responsible, and it is long overdue. And so I think the budget that we are talking about is one that is good for the American people. As you said, long term it is going to bring interest rates down even more so Americans will have more of their own money to spend. They will not have to spend so much in interest. It will make student loans more available and more affordable. In fact the average family, according to Alan Greenspan, if we can stay on this balanced-budget plan over the next 7 years, the average family with a $100,000 mortgage--in fact the average mortgage in the State of Minnesota is $93,600--they will save almost $3,000 a year in interest as opposed to what they would have spent or will spend if we do not really get serious about---- Mr. CUNNINGHAM. They can use it for their child's education, for medical bills, first-time home buyers, or they can even put it away for an IRA to save for when they become chronologically gifted folks. Mr. GUTKNECHT. It is about the difference between government responsibility and Federal responsibility and getting back more personal responsibility. Let the people make their own decisions, let them spend their own money, because we think they can spend it more efficiently than this Federal Government. As I say, I think the American people, once they know the facts, will again conclude that our budget spends more than enough to meet the legitimate needs of this Federal Government and that the target numbers we are working with, they are fair, they are reasonable, they are responsible, and, as I say, they are long overdue. I want to yield some time to you and talk about the other major issue that is confronting this Congress, and this Government, this country, and this world, and that is about Bosnia, and it has been particularly frustrating for me as a freshman Member because things happen pretty fast around here, but I would suspect that most of America, I know all of our colleagues know, that you were one of the most decorated Navy pilots in the Vietnam war, and I think when you talk about military issues and particularly about brushfire wars, and political wars, of civil wars around the world, you speak with a special degree of expertise, and so I want to yield some time to you, and so I welcome one of the other world experts on foreign policy and military affairs. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Do we have to give time to that Air Force guy? Mr. GUTKNECHT. The gentleman from the Air Force, flew F-100's at one time and perhaps maybe he still does, but I would yield first to Congressman Cunningham. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and like I said, I have got an hour special order after this, and I will take up afterward. But what I would like to go through, Mr. Speaker, is what I found is many of the Members on the other side of the aisle, as well as Members on this side of the aisle, are concerned about the other issues that we have talked about, budget debate and across the board. They do not serve on National Security. They are not directly involved with the Bosnia issue, but it is of great concern to them, and they do not have the time to really go out and find out the information. What I would like to do first is kind of set the stage, if my friend, the gentleman from California [Mr. Dornan] would allow me, to just kind of go through and name the players. Later on in the evening I would like to go through the history of the portions of the world that we are talking about going into in Bosnia, from over 600 [[Page H 14155]] years ago on the Field of Flowers and the time of Hugo through the revolution where Nazis invaded Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslavia, back in the 1940's. First of all I would like to go through the players, Mr. Speaker, because, as I said, many people do not associate names, places, religions, with individual groups. For example, Alija Izetbegovic; he is a Bosnian Muslim, but when someone talks about talking about Sarajevo or Bosnia and Herzegovina, they do not necessarily tie the two together. So Izetbegovic is a Bosnian Muslim that is primarily responsible in the Bosnia and Herzegovina area, and primarily Sarajevo, which is where there are headquarters. Now Izetbegovic, like Tudjman, who is a Croatian, is of Roman Catholic descent, and you talk about Zagreb when you talk about that particular portion of their Croatian nationalism. They also during World War II, if you take a look at the two groups, their Croatians fought alongside with Nazi Germany, and they were called the Ustase. They formed the only Nazi concentration camp outside of Germany where they executed and ethnically cleansed over a million and a half Serbs, Jews, and gypsies at one time, and if you take a look also at Franjo Tudjman, Croatian, Roman Catholic, Zagreb, the World War II association was with the Ustase in Nazi Germany. If you look at Slobodan Milosevic, we talk about he is the head of Serbia, not Bosnian Serb, but Serbia, greater Serbia itself. That is a group of Orthodox Catholics. The difference between the two groups; one is Orthodox Catholic, the other is Roman Catholic in the religious affiliations, and of course Milosevic is in Belgrade, and if you look at that portion of the world during World War II, there were three basic groups: the Chetniks which fought under Mihailovic, the Ustase, which were associated with the Nazi Germans, and then you had a well-known man named Tito. He was with the partisans, which was a group of people that fought with the greater Russian Communists. Mihailovic fought for greater Yugoslavia, Tito fought for communism and a greater Russia, so that there is a big conflict, not a conflict but a misunderstanding, of the players and where they really came from. {time} 2115 Let me go into also the number of troops under this agreement that will be placed into Bosnia. Great Britain has come up with 13,000 troops, France 7,500 troops, Spain 4,000, Italy 2,000, Germany 4,000, other NATO countries 2,500, Russia 2,000 troops; and the United States, where they say 20,000 troops, the actual number of troops there, and that will be deployed, will be 32,000 troops, not 20,300 troops. Let me go through, and then I would yield back over to my friend, if he likes, let me go over some of the history perspectives of the area, Mr. Speaker. As I said, many people that are not historians, that have not looked at the issues, have not read the books, they have not gone through the list of that portion of the world. As early as 1389, and let me repeat that so there is no confusion, 1389 on the Field of Blackbirds, some call it the Field of Flowers, saw the Serbian Empire defeated by the Turks. By the end of June, the time of Yugo, former Yugoslavia was dominated by the Turkish Moslems. June 28 today is celebrated much like our Fourth of July in Bosnia, as Independence Day, because it was 600 years of domination of the Ottoman Turks. That is how the same basic ethnic group changed from Serbian to Croatian to Moslem, and the Moslem came from the Turkish Moslem, the Suni Moslem. Mr. DORNAN. If the gentleman will yield for a 1-minute elaboration, Duke, I found out that no matter how good I am or you are, some of our supporters out there have said sometimes a dialog is good. It gets the juices going. We cannot tell the colonel in the chair there, our good Marine Speaker pro tem, to get a cup of coffee or tea, but I am telling people if they want to continue to listen to you, they are going to learn something from you and from me tonight, as they just learned a lot from the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Gutknecht]. I want to flesh this out. This is not a movie, they must listen to us. Let me flesh out why Serbians treat as though it were 2 years ago the battle in the Field of Blackbirds at Kosovo Poije. Here is what happened. Prince Lazar, a tall, handsome Serbian knight, sets up to do battle with the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. He had 400 concubines in Topkapi; interesting place when people go to Istanbul to visit the blue mosque, hundreds of years old, and Hagia Sofia, built by, oh, my gosh, Justinian up here in the corner in 532. The Sultan had reigned for 29 years. Roosevelt got a fourth term, and about 82 days into a 13th year. Thirty-nine years, Sultan Murad, sounds like something for the eyes, Murad I ruled for 29 years. The Serbs were winning, and a Serbian noble, Miloc, that is why so many children are named Milo or Milan or Miloc, Miloc Kobolic pretends to be a deserter-- what you guys in Vietnam called the chu hoi program, come over to our side--in all his knightly armor and garb, a swashbuckling figure, for the mind to conjure this up and know that it is better than anything they do in Hollywood with their fake violence and untrue stories, just a will to fiction. He works his way into the tent of a 29-year ruling Sultan and stabs him to death with a poison dagger. He dies a violent death of torture, and for a while it was pandemonium. It looked like the Serbs had won the day, yet again to save Christendom from the Islamic forces that had gone all the way across North Africa, across the Strait of Gibraltar and conquered most of Spain, driving out, if they would not convert, and killing the Christians and ending the Christendom of St. Augustine in all of North Africa. His son, Sultan Murad's son Bayezid, rallies his forces and inflicts a crushing defeat on the Serbs. They capture and torture to death the leader, Prince Lazar. The Serbs are then forced to pay tribute for decades, turn over many of their women, and promise to do military service in now young Sultan Bayezid's forces for decades. Then the second Battle of Kosovo is fought 59 years later, and the Serbs again almost win. The old date is 15 June, like Waterloo, but you are right, 28 June. And where have we heard that date on this floor before? 28 June 1914 caused George M. Cohen to write ``Over There,'' ``And we won't be back till it's over over there,'' and my dad gets three Purple Hearts, then wound chevrons, poison gas, 11 million of the flower of European youth killed. That started not too far from Kosovo, to the west a little bit, in the city of Sarajevo where a 19-year-old knowing that if he was going to be hit man, he had to move fast, because if he turned 20 he would have gotten capital punishment. And Gavrilo Princip at 19, in Sarajevo, on a street much narrower than the distance between the gentleman and me, he shoots to death the Archduke Ferdinand of the Austral-Hungarian Empire, the heir-apparent, his beautiful wife Sofia, nicks the driver of this big car. And the killing is on, and it has not stopped for this whole bloody era. That is why, when you speak for the Serbs, and you jumped on me a little bit yesterday because in the abbreviated time I'm trying to be fair to Serbs, Croatians, and Moslems here, but the Serbs saved Christendom, as did the Hungarians, as did the Austrians, as did a whole area of southern Europe, held the line, saved Vienna, saved Malta, won the Battle of Leponto in 1571, that is almost two centuries later. This went on for half of this millenium we are ending in 4 years. Just wanted to know, fact is better than fiction. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Mr. Speaker, if I could reclaim my time, my hour is going to expire quickly and then you guys are going to have at it for another hour. But I just want to say that I think this is important. I said earlier that facts are stubborn things. And I think it was Patrick Henry who said that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. The American people need to get plugged into this discussion, whether we are talking about Bosnia or the budget, because I think the American people in many respects are going to be the final arbiters of this debate. I thank you so much for sharing with us the history, because the more you learn about that region, the more you learn about this agreement, the more you learn about what is going on over there, the more troubling this whole story becomes. The real trouble is they are going to be our kids, and they are just kids for [[Page H 14156]] the most part. You see them out here exercising with the various honor guards and color guards and so forth, and you cannot help but feel proud of them. But many of those kids are going to get hurt, they are going to get killed, they are going to get wounded. The American people need to tune into this debate because facts are stubborn things, and the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. The American people, I hope, will be tuned into your discussion as you go on for the next hour.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of May 12, 1995, the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Gutknecht] is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Mr. Speaker, I want to first yield to the gentleman from the great State of Pennsylvania, the Keystone State [Mr. Fox]. We want to talk a little bit tonight about the budget, and then perhaps about the other big issue that I think Americans are concerned with, the issue of Bosnia. So I welcome Representative Fox, and maybe we can talk a little bit about how we got to where we are now and a little bit about the Balanced Budget Act. Mr. FOX of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the leadership the gentleman has taken here in the 104th Congress in focusing our attention on balancing the budget. Mr. Speaker, this is probably the most important issue we have before us, to make sure that we can reduce the cost of government, eliminate the waste, the fraud, and the abuse, and get down to the services that the Federal Government should be taking care of. The fact that we have not balanced the budget since 1969 has given us approximately a $5 trillion debt, and we are paying for that every day, every man, woman, and child in the United States. It has been told to us by no less [[Page H 14149]] than Alan Greenspan, Congressman Gutknecht, that if we in fact come to a balanced budget within 7 years, we will not only increase the number of jobs in the United States by about 200,000 or 300,000, but we will as well reduce the cost of home mortgage payments, we will reduce car payments and, as well, reduce the cost of college loans. I think that is a pretty significant way to helping everyone in America, whether it be seniors, working families and children, making sure they can realize the American dream. I yield back. Mr. GUTKNECHT. I think we should talk a little bit about how we got to where we are. You and I were both elected last November as members of this freshman class, and I think it is important sometimes to reflect back on what the American people were saying a little over 12 months ago. I think what they were really saying is that they understand that the Federal Government has grown too big, it spends too much, it wastes too much of their tax dollars, and they want the Federal Government to be put on a diet. I think they fundamentally believe, and that is what my constituents still are telling me, that it is time to make the Federal Government do what every family has to do, what every business has had to do. In fact, if you look at every major corporation, every minor corporation, every small corporation, every small business, every single day they have to figure out ways to be more efficient. But that is not true of the Federal Government. Mr. Speaker, the first chart I want to show, and I am sure you are familiar with it as well, Representative Fox, is what the President originally proposed in terms of his, quote, ``balanced budget plan.'' Now, this is what the 10-year balanced budget plan would have produced in terms of deficits for as far as the eye could see. This is scored by the Congressional Budget Office, and I think that is the source that the President recommended a few years ago that we use, and the reason is, the CBO has historically been more accurate, more conservative, than any of the other sources which score some of our budget proposals. As you can see, in the year 1996, his proposal would have produced a $196 billion deficit; in 1997, $212 billion; in 1998, $199 billion; in the year 1999, $213 billion; 2000, $220 billion; 2001, $211 billion; 2002, $210 billion, and on out to the year 2005, over $209 billion, over $200 billion deficits literally for as far as the eye could see. That is not what I think the American people wanted when they asked us to balance the budget. I do not think they meant a 10-year plan which creates almost an additional $2 trillion worth of debt. Perhaps you want to talk a little bit about what the American people have said and what this plan said. Mr. FOX of Pennsylvania. I think the American public made it very clear, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike, that in fact what they want is a balanced budget. They have to balance their budget, the schools do, the States do, as you said earlier. Congressman Gutknecht, I know when you were in Minnesota, you had to balance the budget in the State government when you served there in the State legislature. The fact is, on Monday, November 20, Congressman Gutknecht, the President finally agreed to balance the budget in 7 years with honest numbers from the Congressional Budget Office. The President said at that time that he agreed with the Congress to do as follows: The President and the Congress shall enact legislation in the first session of the 104th Congress to achieve a balanced budget not later than the year 2002, as estimated by CBO, and the President and the Congress agreed that the balanced budget must protect future generations, ensure Medicare solvency, reform welfare, and provide adequate funding for Medicaid, education, agriculture, national defense, veterans, and the environment. Further, the balanced budget shall adopt tax policies to help working families and to stimulate future economic growth. Yet despite all of that on November 20, today, just 2 weeks later, or less than 2 weeks, the President vetoed a balanced budget bill. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Now, Representative Fox, it seemed to me like you were reading something there. Was that an actual agreement that was signed? Mr. FOX of Pennsylvania. Yes, it was. Mr. GUTKNECHT. More importantly, I think, as I understand that, that was actually signed into law. So that is not a campaign promise, that is actually a Federal law. Am I correct in that? Mr. FOX of Pennsylvania. Yes, you are correct in that, Congressman Gutknecht. What he said, his commitment was detailed in a continuing resolution to fund the Federal Government to December 15. Mr. GUTKNECHT. So now we have a law, a Federal law, which is a commitment by the President and this Congress to work together to produce a 7-year balanced budget plan, scored by CBO. What were some of the other things that you mentioned, some language that provides adequate funding for what? Mr. FOX of Pennsylvania. For Medicare and for welfare, for adequate funding for Medicaid, for education, agriculture, veterans programs, and the environment. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Well, we all support that, and I think we can do that with the budget we proposed that the President vetoed today that calls for spending almost $12.1 trillion over the next 7 years. Let me point out something else, Representative Fox, and I think you are probably aware of this. But right at the bottom of this chart it also points out that the President's plan was offered for a vote in the Senate, and it got zero votes. As a matter of fact, it was defeated 96 to zero. To their credit, some of our colleagues here in the House offered their own budget alternative, and I do give them credit for that. They went to an awful lot of work to put together a budget alternative to ours. Unfortunately, it only got 73 votes. As you and I both know, one of the critical ingredients in terms of actually structuring a budget and putting it together is, you have to get at least 218 votes in the House and 51 votes in the Senate; otherwise, you are really just sort of whistling in the wind. It really does not make any difference. Unfortunately, our colleagues in the coalition in the House only got 73 votes for theirs. What we have put together, and I think it is important that we understand this, is not only have we put together a balanced budget plan which meets the CBO test, which actually balances the budget in 7 years or less, but we were able to get 218 votes in the House and 51 votes in the Senate. So we passed the two most important hurdles. Mr. FOX of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, the fact is that you have been working and struggling and hoping that we can get this bipartisan support, and I think we will eventually, because I think the American people are now saying, they want a balanced budget. They want the Federal services that the Government can provide where the States cannot take care of them better. What is surprising under that Republican plan that was sent to the President, Medicare spending would total $1.6 trillion, $724 billion more than was spent during the previous 7 years, a 63-percent increase. {time} 2030 When it comes to welfare, the Republican plan would have welfare spending total $878 billion during the next 7 years, $386 billion more than was spent during the last 7 years, a 78 percent increase. Under Medicaid, the Republican plan gives States $791 billion in grant assistance over the next 7 years. That is $358 billion more than was spent during the previous 7 years, a 79 percent increase. On education, under our plan the amount of money available for student loans increases nearly 50 percent during the next 7 years, rising from $24 billion in 1995 to $36 billion in 2002, and the number of student loans will increase from 6.6 million in 1995 to 7.1 million in 1996, the most ever made available. Mr. GUTKNECHT. I want the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Fox] and I to come back to those numbers, but before we do, I want to go back to this basic point, the commitment to a 7-year balanced budget plan. I want to read this quote again for the Members who are watching in their offices and perhaps Americans who are [[Page H 14150]] watching at home: ``The President and the Congress shall.'' It does not say ``ought to,'' or ``it would be a good idea'' or ``may.'' It says, ``The President and the Congress shall enact legislation in the first session,'' that means before we start next year, ``of the 104th Congress to achieve a balanced budget not later than the fiscal year 2002 as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.'' That is a direct quote. That is what the agreement was. That is what the President signed and, most important, that is currently Federal law. I guess it is good news and bad news. The bad news is the President vetoed our attempt today at that plan. We had a plan that we felt very good about, that we felt we could defend. It met the CBO test and it met the vote test and we were able to get the votes to pass it here in the House. That is the bad news, that he vetoed our plan today. The good news, though, is I think the President now is serious. I think the reason he is serious, as the late Senator from Illinois used to say, the late Everett Dirksen, ``The more I feel the heat, the more I see the light.'' I think the President is beginning to feel the heat and I think the administration understands that the American people want us to balance the budget in 7 years. There is another important point that I think the American people want. The more I hear from the American people, the more I hear them saying they also want that tax relief, because they understand very, very well what it could mean to them and their families if the $500- per-child tax credit passes. To many families, the average family with almost three children, let us say the average family with three kids in my district or your district, that is an extra $1,500 in their pockets every year, cash that they can spend to do some home improvements, to buy a new automobile, to take the kids on a vacation, a fishing vacation of some kind, or just to invest and save for the future for the kids' education. So that $500 per child tax credit, people understand very, very clearly. Mr. FOX of Pennsylvania. Let me add to that, I agree with the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Gutknecht]. Beyond that, the tax reform that we have adopted in the House, and hopefully will be adopted by the President as well and signed into law, a joint bill from the Senate and the House, will in fact also give us some other items that are important. It will give us the opportunity for the first time to have a new IRA for $2,000 for individuals, $4,000 for couples, an elder care tax credit, a capital gains tax reduction for individuals of 19 percent, for businesses 28 percent, which will give the infusion of more savings, new jobs, expansion of businesses. It will help our seniors by rolling back the 1993 tax increase on Social Security benefits, together with the opportunity for seniors to earn more. Right now seniors under 70 are capped at $11,280, that they will have deductions from Social Security. But with the new law we just adopted here in the House, seniors will be able to earn up to $30,000 a year without those deductions from their Social Security. Mr. GUTKNECHT. I think seniors can understand that. In fact, I met with one the other day working at a Wal-Mart store in Mankato. Her name is Muriel. If you stop and think about it, in effect Muriel is paying among the highest tax rates of anybody in the United States. As a matter of fact, there is a very good chance that Muriel is paying a higher tax rate than Ross Perot and some of the wealthiest Americans. The American people are not completely confident that we are going to be able to follow through on our promise to balance this budget in 7 years. They hope we do, they think we should, but the one thing they can understand is if next year they actually get this $500 per child tax credit. Let us talk a little bit, and perhaps the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Fox] wants to talk about this chart as well, where the benefits really go, because some of our colleagues on the other side have attempted to sort of distort this issue and to explain that, well, this is a tax cut for the rich. I wonder if we could talk a little bit about this chart and where the benefits really go. Perhaps you want to share some of those ideas. Mr. FOX of Pennsylvania. The fact is there are so many families who will benefit if this does get adopted. I wish you would explain to our colleagues on the floor tonight and those in their offices just what the percentages are, because the poster is closer to you. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Let me just explain what this chart says. This is according to the Heritage Foundation, and they got the information from us. The truth of the matter is that 89 percent of the benefit will go to families earning less than $75,000 a year. Let me repeat that. Eighty- nine percent of the benefit, of the $500-per-child tax credit, will go to families with incomes of less than $75,000 a year. If you look at it, only 4 percent will go to families earning more than $100,000 a year, and only 7 percent will to families earning between $75,000 and $100,000. The truth of the matter is when you talk about this per-child family tax credit of $500, the overwhelming bulk of the benefit goes to average middle-class families, and that is the people we believe deserve the relief. As a matter of fact, you may have heard us talk about it before, that in 1950 the average family was sending about 3 percent of their gross income to the Federal Government. Today that number is up to 24.5 percent of their gross revenues are going to the Federal Government. Families are the ones who need the tax relief the most. So what we are proposing is saying we believe, and I think the American people understand this better than the people here in Washington do, but we happen to believe that families can spend that money much more efficiently than the Federal Government. Let us allow them to keep more of their revenue, let them keep more of their income and spend it themselves, because they are the ones who know how to spend it the most efficiently. As this chart underscores, even more important than anything I have seen is that the overwhelming amount of the benefit is going to go to middle and lower middle income families. We believe that is a good thing and, more importantly, the American people can understand this chart even better than the experts here in Washington. I would like to welcome the gentleman from Las Vegas, NV [Mr. Ensign], the former Speaker of the House, to join us in this debate. Mr. ENSIGN. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for yielding. I serve on the Committee on Ways and Means. We had a lot of debate this year about tax cuts. I am sure, as many of my colleagues in the freshman class, when we were out on the campaign trail last year there were a lot of us that were told by the American people that they feel this weight and this tremendous burden of the Federal Government, and this debt that they feel on them. They feel that more and more the working middle class is bearing this tremendous debt load, that career politicians that have been unable and unwilling to say no to the special interest groups have continued to put on them. If we think back to the 1950's, and especially seniors remember this, the average family of four back in the 1950's paid about $1 out of $50 to the Federal Government. Today the average, just the average income family of four, pays about $1 out of $4 to the Federal Government. The reason is, it has to do with what is happening with your chart, and that is that the personal exemption did not keep pace with inflation. If you look at virtually everything across the board, whether you are talking about a carton of milk or a loaf of bread or cars or houses, if you adjust for inflation, they all cost pretty much the same. Their earning dollars pretty much buy them the same thing they bought back in the 1950's. The difference between the 1950's and today is the tax burden. That is the reason in a two-parent family that when one of the parents, especially when the children are young--and I just had a little girl that was born on Saturday. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Have you named her yet? Mr. ENSIGN. Yes, her name is Sienna. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Sienna. Did you tell her about the debt she inherited when she was born? [[Page H 14151]] Mr. ENSIGN. It is $187,000 this year. I try not to politicize my daughter's birth this year. Fortunately, I am in an income category where my wife has chosen to stay home with the kids for the first 4 or 5 years of their life. We are fortunate to be in an income category to be able to afford that. It used to be in the 1950's that the average income family could afford, in a two-parent family, if either the husband or the wife wanted to stay home and stay with the kids and nurture those kids, especially during those formative years, they could afford to do that. But today they cannot afford to do it, and it is not that they do not earn enough money. It is that the tax burden is too high, and that is one of the things that this $500 per child tax credit will do. Mr. GUTKNECHT. That is basically what has happened in the last 30 or 40 years, is the Federal Government has grown in its influence over our daily lives and the family has actually diminished. What we are trying to do is reinforce families, because we know that the cornerstone of the western civilization is strong families. So this is something that I feel--and you hate to always speak for the freshman class, I know you are a member of the class and the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Fox] is a member of the freshman class--but I think this is something we feel very, very strongly about. We are willing to negotiate in good faith with the President and the administration. But in terms of ever giving up on the $500-per-child tax credit, I think it is one thing that I hope that our class and members of this side of the aisle will fight to the bitter end, because I think this is something the American people can understand. It is going to mean cash in their pockets. It is going to mean money that they get to spend rather than sending it to Washington, and I think that is really what the American people want. I think they want us to downsize the Federal Government. They know it is inefficient, and frankly they are correct. The more I have been here, the more I have realized just how incredibly inefficient this Federal Government is, and the most efficient spender of resources in this country is the American family. Why should we not allow them to keep more of their money and spend it themselves? Mr. ENSIGN. If the gentleman will yield, one of the things, this $245 billion number has been just demagogued to death because they talk about this huge tax cut. Over the next 7 years, under the Republican proposal, we are going to spend about $12.2 trillion. If you think about $1 trillion, to get to $1 trillion, if you had a business that lost $1 million a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, you would have to have that business start at the time of Christ, till now, plus another almost 700 years to get to $1 trillion. Mr. GUTKNECHT. So if you spent $1 million a day 365 days a year from the time of Christ until now. Mr. ENSIGN. Plus 700 years. To get to $1 trillion. In the last 7 years, the Federal Government spent a little over $9 trillion. Under the Republican proposal that you hear about all these cuts, we are going to spend a little over $12 trillion. President Clinton wants to spend almost $13 trillion. So the difference is not in whether we are cutting anything. The difference is whether we are going to increase Federal spending by $3 trillion or $4 trillion. The reason I bring up those numbers, because they are so staggering and they are so hard to think about, is the dollars. These are tax, that is all that is, that is money raised from taxes. The $245 billion is less than 2 percent of the $12.2 trillion. That is what we are talking about. We are only talking about cutting taxes by 2 percent. Mr. GUTKNECHT. So all of these tax cuts that we are hearing demagogued every day on the House floor represents only 2 percent of all the Federal spending over the next 7 years? Mr. ENSIGN. Staggering numbers. That is why if we could just be honest with the American people, and I am sure you heard during your campaign, why can they not be honest with what they are telling us from Washington. Forget about this political spin, just be honest. If we can go to Medicare and tell people, and when you do this, the light bulb just goes off, they say, ``Why are they saying that?'' In Medicare, the total spending in Medicare over the last 7 years was a little over $900 billion, almost $1 trillion. The next 7 years under the Republican proposal, we will spend a little over $1.6 trillion. It is over $700 billion more. Not less. More. I know the educational system is not what it once was, but still, when you spend $700 billion more we still call that addition, and I still think they call that addition today. This is what certain people in this Congress are calling a cut, is $700 billion more spending. I think the chart you have up there talks about some of the premiums, the part B premiums. That is the part that does to doctors. Part A trust fund is the part that goes to hospitals. Part B premiums and part B of the Medicare part is the part that goes to doctors. Why do you not explain a little bit about the differences between the Republican proposal and the Clinton proposal. {time} 2045 Mr. GUTKNECHT. I think it is important and instructive, and one of my favorite quotes is from John Adams, one of the Founders of this great country, and he said that facts are stubborn things, and that sort of is what we have been talking about is let us get the facts out there. Interestingly enough, we just got back a rather in-depth poll. I do not think you should make public policy based upon polls. I think it does confirm instinctively what all of us believe; that is, if the American people are given facts, they overwhelmingly support what we are doing. As a matter of fact, the interesting thing is there was a separate poll we did a couple of weeks ago when they asked the American people essentially some of the questions that are being posed by some of the other national polling media outlets; for example, do you think the Republicans are cutting Medicare too much? Not surprising, a majority of Americans said ``yes.'' But when we explain to them in our poll what the numbers really were and that we were actually increasing total Medicare spending from something like $189 billion a year to $278 billion a year over only 7 years per year and---- Mr. ENSIGN. And per person. Mr. GUTKNECHT. On a per capita basis, per recipient spending actually increases from $4,800 a year this year to $7,000 a year. The interesting thing is when you tell the American people that, in one poll we did a few weeks ago, 63 percent, after they learned that information, after they heard the facts, they said you are increasing spending too much on Medicare. So I think once we get our side of the story told, what this chart basically demonstrates is, while the administration has been demagoging to a certain degree, our Medicare part B premiums plan, the truth of the matter is, if you extend it out to the seventh year, we are really only talking about a difference between our plan and the President's plan of $4.80 a year. Now, that is almost nothing. Mr. ENSIGN. The difference between the President's plan and our plan, how many years does that save Medicare? We save Medicare to what year versus what? Mr. GUTKNECHT. With this chart, we are only talking about part B. When you are talking about the part A trust funds, when you start talking about the trust funds, we are talking about saving the Medicare system from imminent bankruptcy, which the trustees of the Medicare trust fund came out earlier in April and told us that there is a drastic---- Mr. ENSIGN. The Medicare trustees, who are they appointed by? Mr. GUTKNECHT. Appointed by the President; I think three members of his own Cabinet. Mr. ENSIGN. He appoints every single member of the trustees, as I recall? Mr. GUTKNECHT. I believe that is correct. The point is they have no interest in telling us anything than the truth. What they said was, unless the Congress gets serious about reforming the Medicare system, it is going to go bankrupt in 7 years. It will not be able to make the payments. I think everyone now acknowledges there is a serious problem. Again, we have advanced a plan which uses market-based reforms, which I think the American people can understand. [[Page H 14152]] Essentially, one of the reasons they did not like the Clinton health care reform plans that came out a year and a half ago was they did not really believe the Federal Government could do a much more efficient job of running the health delivery system than the private sector. What we did was sort of change the whole notion. Let us see if we can use the things working so well in the private sector to help control costs in Medicare. I am absolutely confident our reform plans are going to work. More important than that, I am convinced seniors who decide to participate in some of these new Medicare-plus programs that we are putting together and allowing to operate, I think, in the end of just a few years, many of them are going to say, ``Yes, I like this plan much better than what we had before,'' because they are going to have options, they are going to have choices, they are going to be treated like human beings, just like everybody else out there. Mr. ENSIGN. You received just recently, like I did, like virtually every other Member of Congress and every Federal employee did during this enrollment period now, where we decide by January which plan we are going to have; I am holding up a card here and this card is a Blue Cross/Blue Shield card. You have the same card. Over 90 percent of the Members of the House of Representatives have this card. The Speaker of the House has this very same card. What we are talking about here is something called a PPO. Seniors in the United States today do not have the same option to choose the health insurance that you and I have to choose, the same as the Speaker of the House has to choose. What we are doing, and, by the way, a PPO is managed care. The vast majority of Americans do not understand that a PPO is actually managed care. It is a very good managed care. We are going to give the seniors options to be able to choose a PPO, just like you and I have the option each year to choose a PPO, and HMO, fee-for-service, medical savings accounts or these new things called provider sponsor organizations. Can you imagine, imagine this scenario, let us say we had all of those options currently in Medicare, can you imagine what would happen, what AARP would say to Members of Congress if we took a whole list of options that seniors had and now tried to reverse it and say no, no, no, we have got a better system for you; instead of having all of those options and all of those things, you can choose from each year, we are going to give you fee-for-service; in a couple of areas of the country we will give you HMOs. That is all you get. Can you imagine the uproar? Mr. GUTKNECHT. They would not stand for it. Mr. ENSIGN. We would have 34 million seniors marching on Washington tomorrow. That is exactly, I mean, if people think about it in that context, we are giving them more choices, more freedoms. The chart you hold up is only people that stay in fee-for-service, and the people that choose PPOs, many of them will actually have less out-of-pocket expenses because they will not have, or these companies will be able to pay their Medicare part B premiums. They may get prescription drug coverage. I have three grandmothers on Medicare. It is absolutely heartbreaking. Luckily, I am able to help some of my grandmothers, with different members of our family help, and sometimes if it was not for that, they would have to choose between what they ate that month and getting prescription drugs. Many seniors are in this same boat. What we want to do is be able to offer seniors in all parts of the country so many choices they will have that option so they do not have to make the choice between what they eat that month and between getting prescription drugs. So I think we just have to put the politics aside. Who cares whether it is Democrats, whether it is Republicans? We have to put the politics aside and do what is right for this country. Mr. GUTKNECHT. The American people, I think, understand this. In fact, when you talk about health care reform, if you look at what has happened in the private sector over the last number of years, we have literally seen the reforms with the various kinds of managed care and much more sophisticated kinds of managed care which are doing an incredibly good job of controlling the growth in health care costs. As a matter of fact, in the State of Minnesota, where we have probably more managed care than virtually any other State in the Union, we have seen health care costs over the last 18 months increasing at only about 1.1 percent. If you look at the private or at the public sector side, if you look at Medicare or Medicaid, we have had health care inflation at a rate of 10.5 percent. So the truth of the matter is we absolutely know that managed care will work. It will help control costs. But more important than that, in the State of Minnesota, we had a study that was done where they interviewed over 17,000 recipients of health care and asked them about how satisfied they were with their health care, and the interesting thing was among seniors who were already in some kind of managed care, their satisfaction with the plan that they have is 3 times greater than those who were in the standard Medicare fee-for-service plan. So it is not just about saving costs. It is not just about squeezing out some of the waste and mismanagement which we know is there. I think the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Fox] has done more to study the whole issue of waste, fraud and abuse in the health care system than anybody. I think if you create these managed care systems and create competition out there, we are going to attack that waste, fraud and abuse so we have more health care for fewer dollars. Mr. FOX of Pennsylvania. I appreciate your leadership as well as the gentleman from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] as well as the gentleman from California [Mr. Cunningham]. We can achieve savings we want by making sure we attack for the first time that health care fraud. Medicare fraud is $30 billion a year. By getting that savings, by offering choice, reducing paperwork costs and making sure we have an efficient system, health care will be preserved for our seniors under Medicare, and we can balance the budget, and I know that the gentleman from California [Mr. Cunningham] from his own experience can tell us about parts of the balanced budget amendment and the Balanced Budget Act that relates to his district, if he could join us in this discussion for that purpose. Mr. GUTKNECHT. He is not a freshman, but we will allow him in on this debate, the gentleman from San Diego, CA [Mr. Cunningham]. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. If you remember, it was our freshman class when I went aboard 5 years ago that had the gang of 7 that closed down the House bank, that found out they were selling cocaine downstairs here, and brought the check scandal to fruition. I think it was the first radical group to come in to make change, and the sophomore class followed, and the 75 young Turks that came in after that have done a bang-up job. I thank you for yielding, and one of the things I would like to talk to is that, you know, some of the more radical Members on the other side of the aisle say that, well, we are cutting education, we are cutting the environment, we are cutting, hurting senior citizens. Unfortunately, this place is about power. It is about the power to be reelected. The power to be reelected over the last 40 years means the power to disburse money from the Federal Government down to the lower ranks so they are going to vote for you so you can get reelected so that you have got the power, and to support that you need the big bureaucracy to support the flow of the money so you can get reelected so you have got the power. What we are doing, and I think the American people would have a legitimate complaint if this Congress and the Republicans were trying to shift that power to the Republican Party, but the whole agenda and a balanced budget amendment and the agenda that we are trying to do is take that power not to Republicans but to the American people, to the States, where it can be more effectively used. We believe that government works closest to the people and it works best there. [[Page H 14153]] You will hear over and over and over again by more liberal Members from Congress here that this is the only place that those decisions can be made. The States cannot make those decisions because in the past they have failed and that they are the only ones that can tell the American people how to do their business. That is a good issue. Mr. GUTKNECHT. That is so important because I think there is sort of this argument that if we do not do the spending, if we do not do the regulating, if we do not do not the controlling, it will not get done. This is not a debate about how much money is going to be spent on education, how much money is going to be spent on nutrition or how much is going to be spent on health care. This is really a fundamental debate about who going to do the spending and who can do it more efficiently. Wht we are really talking about, as you say, you said it so well, is returning more of that decisionmaking back to the States and, more importantly, wherever possible and with the $500 per child tax credit, giving it back to the families because families are much more efficient than local governments, and local governments are much more efficient than State governments, and State governments are far more efficient than Federal Governments. That is why we are talking about welfare reform. We need to talk a little more about that because, again, I think the American people are so far out in front of us it is not even funny. I think they know the welfare system that has been created, controlled, directed, and regulated by the Federal Government has been an abysmal failure. They do not have to go very far in any direction, particularly if they come to this city, to see the results of 30 years of the social welfare state. As a matter of fact, here in Washington, DC, if we go 10 blocks literally in any direction from this Capitol, you will see the results of 30 years of the social welfare state, and the results are devastating and not just in terms of the total costs. We all know we have spent over $5 trillion over the last 30 years, but the real cost is in the human cost because we have replaced self-reliance and families with debt, dependency and despair, and that is what the American people want changed. They know the real way is to send it back to the States through block grants to allow local communities and local individuals to help those who need the help. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Let me be very specific. I would like, Mr. Speaker, for you to listen to these figures because they are accurate and they are important in this debate. The Federal Government only supports 7 percent of education funding, 7 percent. 93 percent of all education is paid for out of State tax dollars. Now, of that 7 percent that we send to States, it occupies over 50 percent of the rules and regulations and burden on the State itself. It represents 75 percent of the paperwork that the State and the schools have to go through that tie up portions of the 93 cents that comes out of the State tax dollars. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Say that again. I think that needs to be repeated. That it is a powerful set of statistics. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. It is. It is very accurate. It is accurate for any State you go into. We happen to have one in eight Americans lives in the State of California. It is the same for any one of the States. The Federal Government only provides 7 percent of the funding for education. 93 percent, or 93 cents out of every dollar, comes out of the State. But yet of that 7 cents, 50 percent of the rules and regulations that tie up the State comes out of that 7 percent of funding from the Federal Government, 75 percent of the paperwork, and by getting back, and for example, my colleague says, well, you look, you cut out Goals 2000, you cut out all the funds for Goals 2000, what a great program. Well, if I send the money directly to the State and the State likes Goal 2000, the Governors have told us they can do a Goals 2000 program much more efficiently. They do not have the Federal rules and regulations, and they will argue, well, it is all voluntary. In the Goals 2000 bill there are 48 instances that say ``States will,'' and requires reporting, requires paperwork, and guess what, on the other end it takes Federal bureaucrats to take in that information, to record it and so on. My wife is a principal. She has to write grants for Goals 2000, and they receive some of the dollars. Many of the schools set up and hire people to write grants. They do not get the dollars, in most cases. Even in the cases they do, quite often, if it is not a larger school, the amount of dollars they get is not as much as it costs to pay the grant writer and to perform the rules and the regulations and the paperwork that comes back to Washington, DC. {time} 2100 So when they say we are cutting, we are actually providing more dollars and more efficiency to the States. And those savings; guess what? Those savings go to balance the budget, and in the case of the education bill, Mr. Speaker, some of those savings went up to NIH for medical research on AIDS, and heart disease, and some of the things that I believe most people in America believe are of national interest and that the Federal Government is the one that can host. So I get kind of upset when they say that we are cutting education, and they say I think the gentleman covered the student finances and the student loans. We are providing more money for student loans than ever in the history. But guess where the savings come from? The President's bill on direct lending, and I would like to give you, Mr. Speaker, some accurate figures as well, if I can find them here, that what the costs of the President's direct lending costs us. The President asks, or the President's costs, cost $1 billion over the next 7 years more than private student loans, $1 billion for the direct loan period, and guess what? CBO and OMB have not even calculated what it costs to collect those loans. That is just the distribution of it. So when we say---- Mr. GUTKNECHT. That is just the overhead. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Just the overhead, $1 billion more than sending it to the private enterprises, but yet our colleagues say, well, that is only for the rich, that is for your loan guys, and that is for your banks. Well, I can do something cheaper and better and provide more loans to the students that really need them, and the Pell grants which have been increased higher than any other level in the time of history, then I think that is better, instead again of having the Federal Government up here being able to dole out the money, and guess what? That direct student loan program, the President wanted billions more dollars to increase it by fourscore, and that would make the Department of Education the biggest lending entity in the world, I mean other than the World Bank, and that is what they want. They want that power of the Federal dollars to come down so that they can say, well, look at the grant that I gave you here. But they forget one thing, Mr. Speaker. They forget where the money came from in the first place. It is not their money. They take if from the very people, send it up here, and let me give you another accurate figure, Mr. Speaker, and this is one for my colleague to remember also. Only 23 cents out of every dollar that comes to Washington gets back into the classroom, 23 cents on every dollar. Mr. GUTKNECHT. That is a pretty poor return on the investment. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Only 30 cents in welfare gets down to the recipients that really need the welfare check because of all the bureaucracy. Now my colleagues on the other side of the aisle or this side of the aisle, or the American public, you cannot run a business like that, and what the Governors have come to us and said is let us have the dollars, you do not want children to go hungry, you want the needy to be taken care of, you want the help. But you have got 144-some welfare programs, you have got 250 education programs. Let us set our own State standards, give us the money, do away with the Federal requirements and the bureaucracy, and we can make it more efficient. And guess what? We can apply those savings to the deficit and reduce, and what you have been talking about, what Alan Greenspan said, is that interest rates have already come down 2 percent. Why? Because the lending institutions for the first time in over 40 years believe that Congress is serious about [[Page H 14154]] balancing the budget, and if that expectation goes away, those interest rates would not only go back to where they were, they will spiral upward and upward, and then look what it costs for a student loan in the increased interest. Look what it costs for a home with increased interest. I do not know about you, but most Americans, when interest rates came down, they refinanced their home, and I would encourage you, Mr. Speaker, if you have not done it already, take a serious look because it is going to be cheaper on your payments, and what does that mean? It means more dollars in the pockets of the American people. And these are some of the things on education, and I have a special order later tonight that I want to go through in depth some of these same issues on education and go through grant by grant, loan by loan, education bill and education program by education program and show what we have really done. If you say cut at a Federal level, yes, I will zero out any program I can at a Federal level and pass it on down to the State because I think and believe from the bottom of my heart it is much more efficient, it is closer to the people, and they can decide better where those dollars will be used, and I think that is what we are trying to do here. Mr. GUTKNECHT. The examples you have given, Congressman Cunningham, are so good, and frankly I think the American people instinctively understand just what you have talked about tonight. They understand that what we really need to do is localize, and privatize, and downsize this Federal Government, and that is what we are trying to do, and when they talk about cuts in education, we are talking about moving more of that educational decisionmaking back to the States, local units, and to families where they can make their own decisions about what they are going to do with their kids and the schools that they have, and frankly I think every American family understands this. They care much more about their kids' education than some bureaucrat in Washington. You know we can all talk about caring, and everybody talks about compassion, but real caring and real compassion happens around the kitchen table. It is families that care most about their kids' education, and that is what we want to get back to, and the waste and mismanagement here in this city, as I say, is just awesome, and I know you are going to talk a little bit about Bosnia, and I want to hear a little more, and I see Congressman Dornan is here tonight as well to talk a little bit about military affairs, and I believe in a strong defense, but just look at the Defense Department and the amount of waste, and duplication, and mismanagement that we see, and I know that your other colleague from San Diego once told me, Congressman Hunter, about how many buyers they have at the Pentagon. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Congressman who? Mr. GUTKNECHT. Hunter. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Congressman who? Mr. GUTKNECHT. Congressman Duncan Hunter. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Congressman who? Mr. GUTKNECHT. Duncan Hunter. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. He told me to mention his name three times. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Why? The duck comes down and you win 50 bucks? But he talked about how may buyers, and it is like 106,000 buyers in the Department of Defense. We have 1,646 buyers for every F-16 we buy, and we buy 1 or 2 a week, something like that, and it is replete throughout the Federal Government. We all know that, the people that we serve know that, and the interesting thing, and we talked a little bit earlier about the megapoll that we did; it just confirms, I think, the common sense we all have, and that is once the American people understand what we are doing, once they see how much we are actually going to be spending, if anything the criticism is that we are still spending too much. Our budget calls for almost $12.1 trillion worth of spending over the next 7 years, and if you divide that up, it works out to over $46,500 in Federal spending for every man, woman, and child in the United States. Let me say that again. Over the next 7 years, Mr. Speaker, our budget plan, which the President vetoed today as cutting too much, will spend $46,500 for every man, woman, and child in the United States. Now what we are saying, I think in very simple language, we believe the $12.2 trillion is more than enough to fund the legitimate needs of this Federal Government and to take care of those people who depend on the Federal Government for various services; $12.1 trillion is more than enough. $13 trillion will bust the bank, and it will bust the taxpayers. In fact I think, if we can get the American people to look more at the facts of our budget, I think they will come to the same conclusion that we have come to, and that is that our budget is fair, it is reasonable, it is responsible, and it is long overdue. And so I think the budget that we are talking about is one that is good for the American people. As you said, long term it is going to bring interest rates down even more so Americans will have more of their own money to spend. They will not have to spend so much in interest. It will make student loans more available and more affordable. In fact the average family, according to Alan Greenspan, if we can stay on this balanced-budget plan over the next 7 years, the average family with a $100,000 mortgage--in fact the average mortgage in the State of Minnesota is $93,600--they will save almost $3,000 a year in interest as opposed to what they would have spent or will spend if we do not really get serious about---- Mr. CUNNINGHAM. They can use it for their child's education, for medical bills, first-time home buyers, or they can even put it away for an IRA to save for when they become chronologically gifted folks. Mr. GUTKNECHT. It is about the difference between government responsibility and Federal responsibility and getting back more personal responsibility. Let the people make their own decisions, let them spend their own money, because we think they can spend it more efficiently than this Federal Government. As I say, I think the American people, once they know the facts, will again conclude that our budget spends more than enough to meet the legitimate needs of this Federal Government and that the target numbers we are working with, they are fair, they are reasonable, they are responsible, and, as I say, they are long overdue. I want to yield some time to you and talk about the other major issue that is confronting this Congress, and this Government, this country, and this world, and that is about Bosnia, and it has been particularly frustrating for me as a freshman Member because things happen pretty fast around here, but I would suspect that most of America, I know all of our colleagues know, that you were one of the most decorated Navy pilots in the Vietnam war, and I think when you talk about military issues and particularly about brushfire wars, and political wars, of civil wars around the world, you speak with a special degree of expertise, and so I want to yield some time to you, and so I welcome one of the other world experts on foreign policy and military affairs. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Do we have to give time to that Air Force guy? Mr. GUTKNECHT. The gentleman from the Air Force, flew F-100's at one time and perhaps maybe he still does, but I would yield first to Congressman Cunningham. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and like I said, I have got an hour special order after this, and I will take up afterward. But what I would like to go through, Mr. Speaker, is what I found is many of the Members on the other side of the aisle, as well as Members on this side of the aisle, are concerned about the other issues that we have talked about, budget debate and across the board. They do not serve on National Security. They are not directly involved with the Bosnia issue, but it is of great concern to them, and they do not have the time to really go out and find out the information. What I would like to do first is kind of set the stage, if my friend, the gentleman from California [Mr. Dornan] would allow me, to just kind of go through and name the players. Later on in the evening I would like to go through the history of the portions of the world that we are talking about going into in Bosnia, from over 600 [[Page H 14155]] years ago on the Field of Flowers and the time of Hugo through the revolution where Nazis invaded Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslavia, back in the 1940's. First of all I would like to go through the players, Mr. Speaker, because, as I said, many people do not associate names, places, religions, with individual groups. For example, Alija Izetbegovic; he is a Bosnian Muslim, but when someone talks about talking about Sarajevo or Bosnia and Herzegovina, they do not necessarily tie the two together. So Izetbegovic is a Bosnian Muslim that is primarily responsible in the Bosnia and Herzegovina area, and primarily Sarajevo, which is where there are headquarters. Now Izetbegovic, like Tudjman, who is a Croatian, is of Roman Catholic descent, and you talk about Zagreb when you talk about that particular portion of their Croatian nationalism. They also during World War II, if you take a look at the two groups, their Croatians fought alongside with Nazi Germany, and they were called the Ustase. They formed the only Nazi concentration camp outside of Germany where they executed and ethnically cleansed over a million and a half Serbs, Jews, and gypsies at one time, and if you take a look also at Franjo Tudjman, Croatian, Roman Catholic, Zagreb, the World War II association was with the Ustase in Nazi Germany. If you look at Slobodan Milosevic, we talk about he is the head of Serbia, not Bosnian Serb, but Serbia, greater Serbia itself. That is a group of Orthodox Catholics. The difference between the two groups; one is Orthodox Catholic, the other is Roman Catholic in the religious affiliations, and of course Milosevic is in Belgrade, and if you look at that portion of the world during World War II, there were three basic groups: the Chetniks which fought under Mihailovic, the Ustase, which were associated with the Nazi Germans, and then you had a well-known man named Tito. He was with the partisans, which was a group of people that fought with the greater Russian Communists. Mihailovic fought for greater Yugoslavia, Tito fought for communism and a greater Russia, so that there is a big conflict, not a conflict but a misunderstanding, of the players and where they really came from. {time} 2115 Let me go into also the number of troops under this agreement that will be placed into Bosnia. Great Britain has come up with 13,000 troops, France 7,500 troops, Spain 4,000, Italy 2,000, Germany 4,000, other NATO countries 2,500, Russia 2,000 troops; and the United States, where they say 20,000 troops, the actual number of troops there, and that will be deployed, will be 32,000 troops, not 20,300 troops. Let me go through, and then I would yield back over to my friend, if he likes, let me go over some of the history perspectives of the area, Mr. Speaker. As I said, many people that are not historians, that have not looked at the issues, have not read the books, they have not gone through the list of that portion of the world. As early as 1389, and let me repeat that so there is no confusion, 1389 on the Field of Blackbirds, some call it the Field of Flowers, saw the Serbian Empire defeated by the Turks. By the end of June, the time of Yugo, former Yugoslavia was dominated by the Turkish Moslems. June 28 today is celebrated much like our Fourth of July in Bosnia, as Independence Day, because it was 600 years of domination of the Ottoman Turks. That is how the same basic ethnic group changed from Serbian to Croatian to Moslem, and the Moslem came from the Turkish Moslem, the Suni Moslem. Mr. DORNAN. If the gentleman will yield for a 1-minute elaboration, Duke, I found out that no matter how good I am or you are, some of our supporters out there have said sometimes a dialog is good. It gets the juices going. We cannot tell the colonel in the chair there, our good Marine Speaker pro tem, to get a cup of coffee or tea, but I am telling people if they want to continue to listen to you, they are going to learn something from you and from me tonight, as they just learned a lot from the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Gutknecht]. I want to flesh this out. This is not a movie, they must listen to us. Let me flesh out why Serbians treat as though it were 2 years ago the battle in the Field of Blackbirds at Kosovo Poije. Here is what happened. Prince Lazar, a tall, handsome Serbian knight, sets up to do battle with the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. He had 400 concubines in Topkapi; interesting place when people go to Istanbul to visit the blue mosque, hundreds of years old, and Hagia Sofia, built by, oh, my gosh, Justinian up here in the corner in 532. The Sultan had reigned for 29 years. Roosevelt got a fourth term, and about 82 days into a 13th year. Thirty-nine years, Sultan Murad, sounds like something for the eyes, Murad I ruled for 29 years. The Serbs were winning, and a Serbian noble, Miloc, that is why so many children are named Milo or Milan or Miloc, Miloc Kobolic pretends to be a deserter-- what you guys in Vietnam called the chu hoi program, come over to our side--in all his knightly armor and garb, a swashbuckling figure, for the mind to conjure this up and know that it is better than anything they do in Hollywood with their fake violence and untrue stories, just a will to fiction. He works his way into the tent of a 29-year ruling Sultan and stabs him to death with a poison dagger. He dies a violent death of torture, and for a while it was pandemonium. It looked like the Serbs had won the day, yet again to save Christendom from the Islamic forces that had gone all the way across North Africa, across the Strait of Gibraltar and conquered most of Spain, driving out, if they would not convert, and killing the Christians and ending the Christendom of St. Augustine in all of North Africa. His son, Sultan Murad's son Bayezid, rallies his forces and inflicts a crushing defeat on the Serbs. They capture and torture to death the leader, Prince Lazar. The Serbs are then forced to pay tribute for decades, turn over many of their women, and promise to do military service in now young Sultan Bayezid's forces for decades. Then the second Battle of Kosovo is fought 59 years later, and the Serbs again almost win. The old date is 15 June, like Waterloo, but you are right, 28 June. And where have we heard that date on this floor before? 28 June 1914 caused George M. Cohen to write ``Over There,'' ``And we won't be back till it's over over there,'' and my dad gets three Purple Hearts, then wound chevrons, poison gas, 11 million of the flower of European youth killed. That started not too far from Kosovo, to the west a little bit, in the city of Sarajevo where a 19-year-old knowing that if he was going to be hit man, he had to move fast, because if he turned 20 he would have gotten capital punishment. And Gavrilo Princip at 19, in Sarajevo, on a street much narrower than the distance between the gentleman and me, he shoots to death the Archduke Ferdinand of the Austral-Hungarian Empire, the heir-apparent, his beautiful wife Sofia, nicks the driver of this big car. And the killing is on, and it has not stopped for this whole bloody era. That is why, when you speak for the Serbs, and you jumped on me a little bit yesterday because in the abbreviated time I'm trying to be fair to Serbs, Croatians, and Moslems here, but the Serbs saved Christendom, as did the Hungarians, as did the Austrians, as did a whole area of southern Europe, held the line, saved Vienna, saved Malta, won the Battle of Leponto in 1571, that is almost two centuries later. This went on for half of this millenium we are ending in 4 years. Just wanted to know, fact is better than fiction. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Mr. Speaker, if I could reclaim my time, my hour is going to expire quickly and then you guys are going to have at it for another hour. But I just want to say that I think this is important. I said earlier that facts are stubborn things. And I think it was Patrick Henry who said that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. The American people need to get plugged into this discussion, whether we are talking about Bosnia or the budget, because I think the American people in many respects are going to be the final arbiters of this debate. I thank you so much for sharing with us the history, because the more you learn about that region, the more you learn about this agreement, the more you learn about what is going on over there, the more troubling this whole story becomes. The real trouble is they are going to be our kids, and they are just kids for [[Page H 14156]] the most part. You see them out here exercising with the various honor guards and color guards and so forth, and you cannot help but feel proud of them. But many of those kids are going to get hurt, they are going to get killed, they are going to get wounded. The American people need to tune into this debate because facts are stubborn things, and the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. The American people, I hope, will be tuned into your discussion as you go on for the next hour. ","['The SPEAKER ', ""pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of May 12, 1995, the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Gutknecht] is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. "", 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' Mr. ', 'Speaker, I ', 'want to first yield to the gentleman from the great State of Pennsylvania, the Keystone State [Mr. Fox]. We want to talk a little bit tonight about the budget, and then perhaps about the other big issue that I think Americans are concerned with, the issue of Bosnia. ', 'So I ', 'welcome Representative Fox, and maybe we can talk a little bit about how we got to where we are now and a little bit about the Balanced Budget Act. ', 'Mr. FOX ', 'of Pennsylvania. Mr. ', 'Speaker, I ', 'appreciate the leadership the gentleman has taken here in the 104th Congress in focusing our attention on balancing the budget. Mr. Speaker, this is probably the most important issue we have before us, to make sure that we can reduce the cost of government, eliminate the waste, the fraud, and the abuse, and get down to the services that the Federal Government should be taking care of. The fact that we have not balanced the budget since 1969 has given us approximately a $5 trillion debt, and we are paying for that every day, every man, woman, and child in the United States. It has been told to us by no less [[', 'Page H ', '14149]] than Alan Greenspan, Congressman Gutknecht, that if we in fact come to a balanced budget within 7 years, we will not only increase the number of jobs in the United States by about 200,000 or 300,000, but we will as well reduce the cost of home mortgage payments, we will reduce car payments and, as well, reduce the cost of college loans. I think that is a pretty significant way to helping everyone in America, whether it be seniors, working families and children, making sure they can realize the American dream. I yield back. ', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', "" I think we should talk a little bit about how we got to where we are. You and I were both elected last November as members of this freshman class, and I think it is important sometimes to reflect back on what the American people were saying a little over 12 months ago. I think what they were really saying is that they understand that the Federal Government has grown too big, it spends too much, it wastes too much of their tax dollars, and they want the Federal Government to be put on a diet. I think they fundamentally believe, and that is what my constituents still are telling me, that it is time to make the Federal Government do what every family has to do, what every business has had to do. In fact, if you look at every major corporation, every minor corporation, every small corporation, every small business, every single day they have to figure out ways to be more efficient. But that is not true of the Federal Government. Mr. Speaker, the first chart I want to show, and I am sure you are familiar with it as well, Representative Fox, is what the President originally proposed in terms of his, quote, ``balanced budget plan.'' Now, this is what the 10-year balanced budget plan would have produced in terms of deficits for as far as the eye could see. This is scored by the Congressional Budget Office, and I think that is the source that the President recommended a few years ago that we use, and the reason is, the CBO has historically been more accurate, more conservative, than any of the other sources which score some of our budget proposals. As you can see, in the year 1996, his proposal would have produced a $196 billion deficit; in 1997, $212 billion; in 1998, $199 billion; in the year 1999, $213 billion; 2000, $220 billion; 2001, $211 billion; 2002, $210 billion, and on out to the year 2005, over $209 billion, over $200 billion deficits literally for as far as the eye could see. That is not what I think the American people wanted when they asked us to balance the budget. I do not think they meant a 10-year plan which creates almost an additional $2 trillion worth of debt. Perhaps you want to talk a little bit about what the American people have said and what this plan said. "", 'Mr. FOX ', 'of ', 'Pennsylvania. I ', 'think the American public made it very clear, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike, that in fact what they want is a balanced budget. They have to balance their budget, the schools do, the States do, as you said earlier. Congressman ', 'Gutknecht, I ', 'know when you were in Minnesota, you had to balance the budget in the State government when you served there in the State legislature. The fact is, on Monday, November 20, Congressman Gutknecht, the President finally agreed to balance the budget in 7 years with honest numbers from the Congressional Budget Office. The President said at that time that he agreed with the Congress to do as follows: The President and the Congress shall enact legislation in the first session of the 104th Congress to achieve a balanced budget not later than the year 2002, as estimated by CBO, and the President and the Congress agreed that the balanced budget must protect future generations, ensure Medicare solvency, reform welfare, and provide adequate funding for Medicaid, education, agriculture, national defense, veterans, and the environment. Further, the balanced budget shall adopt tax policies to help working families and to stimulate future economic growth. Yet despite all of that on November 20, today, just 2 weeks later, or less than 2 weeks, the President vetoed a balanced budget bill. ', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' Now, Representative Fox, it seemed to me like you were reading something there. Was that an actual agreement that was signed? ', 'Mr. FOX ', 'of Pennsylvania. Yes, it was. ', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' More importantly, I think, as I understand that, that was actually signed into law. So that is not a campaign promise, that is actually a Federal law. ', 'Am I ', 'correct in that? ', 'Mr. FOX ', 'of Pennsylvania. Yes, you are correct in that, Congressman Gutknecht. What he said, his commitment was detailed in a continuing resolution to fund the Federal Government to December 15. ', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' So now we have a law, a Federal law, which is a commitment by the President and this Congress to work together to produce a 7-year balanced budget plan, scored by CBO. What were some of the other things that you mentioned, some language that provides adequate funding for what? ', 'Mr. FOX ', 'of Pennsylvania. For Medicare and for welfare, for adequate funding for Medicaid, for education, agriculture, veterans programs, and the environment. ', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', "" Well, we all support that, and I think we can do that with the budget we proposed that the President vetoed today that calls for spending almost $12.1 trillion over the next 7 years. Let me point out something else, Representative Fox, and I think you are probably aware of this. But right at the bottom of this chart it also points out that the President's plan was offered for a vote in the Senate, and it got zero votes. As a matter of fact, it was defeated 96 to zero. To their credit, some of our colleagues here in the House offered their own budget alternative, and I do give them credit for that. They went to an awful lot of work to put together a budget alternative to ours. Unfortunately, it only got 73 votes. As you and I both know, one of the critical ingredients in terms of actually structuring a budget and putting it together is, you have to get at least 218 votes in the House and 51 votes in the Senate; otherwise, you are really just sort of whistling in the wind. It really does not make any difference. Unfortunately, our colleagues in the coalition in the House only got 73 votes for theirs. What we have put together, and I think it is important that we understand this, is not only have we put together a balanced budget plan which meets the CBO test, which actually balances the budget in 7 years or less, but we were able to get 218 votes in the House and 51 votes in the Senate. So we passed the two most important hurdles. "", 'Mr. FOX ', 'of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, the fact is that you have been working and struggling and hoping that we can get this bipartisan support, and I think we will eventually, because I think the American people are now saying, they want a balanced budget. They want the Federal services that the Government can provide where the States cannot take care of them better. What is surprising under that Republican plan that was sent to the President, Medicare spending would total $1.6 trillion, $724 billion more than was spent during the previous 7 years, a 63-percent increase. {time} 2030 When it comes to welfare, the Republican plan would have welfare spending total $878 billion during the next 7 years, $386 billion more than was spent during the last 7 years, a 78 percent increase. Under Medicaid, the Republican plan gives States $791 billion in grant assistance over the next 7 years. That is $358 billion more than was spent during the previous 7 years, a 79 percent increase. On education, under our plan the amount of money available for student loans increases nearly 50 percent during the next 7 years, rising from $24 billion in 1995 to $36 billion in 2002, and the number of student loans will increase from 6.6 million in 1995 to 7.1 million in 1996, the most ever made available. ', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' I want the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Fox] and I to come back to those numbers, but before we do, I want to go back to this basic point, the commitment to a 7-year balanced budget plan. I want to read this quote again for the Members who are watching in their offices and perhaps Americans who are [[', 'Page H ', ""14150]] watching at home: ``The President and the Congress shall.'' It does not say ``ought to,'' or ``it would be a good idea'' or ``may.'' It says, ``The President and the Congress shall enact legislation in the first session,'' that means before we start next year, ``of the 104th Congress to achieve a balanced budget not later than the fiscal year 2002 as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.'' That is a direct quote. That is what the agreement was. That is what the President signed and, most important, that is currently Federal law. I guess it is good news and bad news. The bad news is the President vetoed our attempt today at that plan. We had a plan that we felt very good about, that we felt we could defend. It met the CBO test and it met the vote test and we were able to get the votes to pass it here in the House. That is the bad news, that he vetoed our plan today. The good news, though, is I think the President now is serious. I think the reason he is serious, as the late Senator from Illinois used to say, the late Everett Dirksen, ``The more I feel the heat, the more I see the light.'' I think the President is beginning to feel the heat and I think the administration understands that the American people want us to balance the budget in 7 years. There is another important point that I think the American people want. The more I hear from the American people, the more I hear them saying they also want that tax relief, because they understand very, very well what it could mean to them and their families if the $500- per-child tax credit passes. To many families, the average family with almost three children, let us say the average family with three kids in my district or your district, that is an extra $1,500 in their pockets every year, cash that they can spend to do some home improvements, to buy a new automobile, to take the kids on a vacation, a fishing vacation of some kind, or just to invest and save for the future for the kids' education. So that $500 per child tax credit, people understand very, very clearly. "", 'Mr. FOX ', 'of Pennsylvania. Let me add to that, I agree with the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Gutknecht]. Beyond that, the tax reform that we have adopted in the House, and hopefully will be adopted by the President as well and signed into law, a joint bill from the Senate and the House, will in fact also give us some other items that are important. It will give us the opportunity for the first time to have a new IRA for $2,000 for individuals, $4,000 for couples, an elder care tax credit, a capital gains tax reduction for individuals of 19 percent, for businesses 28 percent, which will give the infusion of more savings, new jobs, expansion of businesses. It will help our seniors by rolling back the 1993 tax increase on Social Security benefits, together with the opportunity for seniors to earn more. Right now seniors under 70 are capped at $11,280, that they will have deductions from Social Security. But with the new law we just adopted here in the House, seniors will be able to earn up to $30,000 a year without those deductions from their Social Security. ', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' I think seniors can understand that. In fact, I met with one the other day working at a Wal-Mart store in Mankato. Her name is Muriel. If you stop and think about it, in effect Muriel is paying among the highest tax rates of anybody in the United States. As a matter of fact, there is a very good chance that Muriel is paying a higher tax rate than Ross Perot and some of the wealthiest Americans. The American people are not completely confident that we are going to be able to follow through on our promise to balance this budget in 7 years. They hope we do, they think we should, but the one thing they can understand is if next year they actually get this $500 per child tax credit. Let us talk a little bit, and perhaps the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Fox] wants to talk about this chart as well, where the benefits really go, because some of our colleagues on the other side have attempted to sort of distort this issue and to explain that, well, this is a tax cut for the rich. I wonder if we could talk a little bit about this chart and where the benefits really go. Perhaps you want to share some of those ideas. ', 'Mr. FOX ', 'of Pennsylvania. The fact is there are so many families who will benefit if this does get adopted. I wish you would explain to our colleagues on the floor tonight and those in their offices just what the percentages are, because the poster is closer to you. ', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' Let me just explain what this chart says. This is according to the Heritage Foundation, and they got the information from us. The truth of the matter is that 89 percent of the benefit will go to families earning less than $75,000 a year. Let me repeat that. Eighty- nine percent of the benefit, of the $500-per-child tax credit, will go to families with incomes of less than $75,000 a year. If you look at it, only 4 percent will go to families earning more than $100,000 a year, and only 7 percent will to families earning between $75,000 and $100,000. The truth of the matter is when you talk about this per-child family tax credit of $500, the overwhelming bulk of the benefit goes to average middle-class families, and that is the people we believe deserve the relief. As a matter of fact, you may have heard us talk about it before, that in 1950 the average family was sending about 3 percent of their gross income to the Federal Government. Today that number is up to 24.5 percent of their gross revenues are going to the Federal Government. Families are the ones who need the tax relief the most. So what we are proposing is saying we believe, and I think the American people understand this better than the people here in Washington do, but we happen to believe that families can spend that money much more efficiently than the Federal Government. Let us allow them to keep more of their revenue, let them keep more of their income and spend it themselves, because they are the ones who know how to spend it the most efficiently. As this chart underscores, even more important than anything I have seen is that the overwhelming amount of the benefit is going to go to middle and lower middle income families. We believe that is a good thing and, more importantly, the American people can understand this chart even better than the experts here in ', 'Washington. I ', 'would like to welcome the gentleman from Las ', 'Vegas, NV ', '[Mr. Ensign], the former Speaker of the House, to join us in this debate. ', 'Mr. ENSIGN.', "" I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for yielding. I serve on the Committee on Ways and Means. We had a lot of debate this year about tax cuts. I am sure, as many of my colleagues in the freshman class, when we were out on the campaign trail last year there were a lot of us that were told by the American people that they feel this weight and this tremendous burden of the Federal Government, and this debt that they feel on them. They feel that more and more the working middle class is bearing this tremendous debt load, that career politicians that have been unable and unwilling to say no to the special interest groups have continued to put on them. If we think back to the 1950's, and especially seniors remember this, the average family of four back in the 1950's paid about $1 out of $50 to the Federal Government. Today the average, just the average income family of four, pays about $1 out of $4 to the Federal Government. The reason is, it has to do with what is happening with your chart, and that is that the personal exemption did not keep pace with inflation. If you look at virtually everything across the board, whether you are talking about a carton of milk or a loaf of bread or cars or houses, if you adjust for inflation, they all cost pretty much the same. Their earning dollars pretty much buy them the same thing they bought back in the 1950's. The difference between the 1950's and today is the tax burden. That is the reason in a two-parent family that when one of the parents, especially when the children are young--and I just had a little girl that was born on Saturday. "", 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' Have you named her yet? ', 'Mr. ENSIGN.', ' Yes, her name is Sienna. ', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' Sienna. Did you tell her about the debt she inherited when she was born? [[', 'Page H ', '14151]] ', 'Mr. ENSIGN.', "" It is $187,000 this year. I try not to politicize my daughter's birth this year. "", 'Fortunately, I ', ""am in an income category where my wife has chosen to stay home with the kids for the first 4 or 5 years of their life. We are fortunate to be in an income category to be able to afford that. It used to be in the 1950's that the average income family could afford, in a two-parent family, if either the husband or the wife wanted to stay home and stay with the kids and nurture those kids, especially during those formative years, they could afford to do that. But today they cannot afford to do it, and it is not that they do not earn enough money. It is that the tax burden is too high, and that is one of the things that this $500 per child tax credit will do. "", 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' That is basically what has happened in the last 30 or 40 years, is the Federal Government has grown in its influence over our daily lives and the family has actually diminished. What we are trying to do is reinforce families, because we know that the cornerstone of the western civilization is strong families. So this is something that I feel--and you hate to always speak for the freshman class, I know you are a member of the class and the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Fox] is a member of the freshman class--but I think this is something we feel very, very strongly about. We are willing to negotiate in good faith with the President and the administration. But in terms of ever giving up on the $500-per-child tax credit, I think it is one thing that I hope that our class and members of this side of the aisle will fight to the bitter end, because I think this is something the American people can understand. It is going to mean cash in their pockets. It is going to mean money that they get to spend rather than sending it to Washington, and I think that is really what the American people want. I think they want us to downsize the Federal Government. They know it is inefficient, and frankly they are correct. The more I have been here, the more I have realized just how incredibly inefficient this Federal Government is, and the most efficient spender of resources in this country is the American family. Why should we not allow them to keep more of their money and spend it themselves? ', 'Mr. ENSIGN.', ' If the gentleman will yield, one of the things, this $245 billion number has been just demagogued to death because they talk about this huge tax cut. Over the next 7 years, under the Republican proposal, we are going to spend about $12.2 trillion. If you think about $1 trillion, to get to $1 trillion, if you had a business that lost $1 million a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, you would have to have that business start at the time of Christ, till now, plus another almost 700 years to get to $1 trillion. ', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' So if you spent $1 million a day 365 days a year from the time of Christ until now. ', 'Mr. ENSIGN.', ' Plus 700 years. To get to $1 trillion. In the last 7 years, the Federal Government spent a little over $9 trillion. Under the Republican proposal that you hear about all these cuts, we are going to spend a little over $12 trillion. President Clinton wants to spend almost $13 trillion. So the difference is not in whether we are cutting anything. The difference is whether we are going to increase Federal spending by $3 trillion or $4 trillion. The reason I bring up those numbers, because they are so staggering and they are so hard to think about, is the dollars. These are tax, that is all that is, that is money raised from taxes. The $245 billion is less than 2 percent of the $12.2 trillion. That is what we are talking about. We are only talking about cutting taxes by 2 percent. ', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' So all of these tax cuts that we are hearing demagogued every day on the House floor represents only 2 percent of all the Federal spending over the next 7 years? ', 'Mr. ENSIGN.', "" Staggering numbers. That is why if we could just be honest with the American people, and I am sure you heard during your campaign, why can they not be honest with what they are telling us from Washington. Forget about this political spin, just be honest. If we can go to Medicare and tell people, and when you do this, the light bulb just goes off, they say, ``Why are they saying that?'' In Medicare, the total spending in Medicare over the last 7 years was a little over $900 billion, almost $1 trillion. The next 7 years under the Republican proposal, we will spend a little over $1.6 trillion. It is over $700 billion more. Not less. "", 'More. I ', 'know the educational system is not what it once was, but still, when you spend $700 billion more we still call that addition, and I still think they call that addition today. This is what certain people in this Congress are calling a cut, is $700 billion more spending. I think the chart you have up there talks about some of the premiums, the part B premiums. That is the part that does to doctors. ', 'Part A ', 'trust fund is the part that goes to hospitals. ', 'Part B ', 'premiums and part B of the Medicare part is the part that goes to doctors. Why do you not explain a little bit about the differences between the Republican proposal and the Clinton proposal. {time} 2045 ', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', "" I think it is important and instructive, and one of my favorite quotes is from John Adams, one of the Founders of this great country, and he said that facts are stubborn things, and that sort of is what we have been talking about is let us get the facts out there. Interestingly enough, we just got back a rather in-depth poll. I do not think you should make public policy based upon polls. I think it does confirm instinctively what all of us believe; that is, if the American people are given facts, they overwhelmingly support what we are doing. As a matter of fact, the interesting thing is there was a separate poll we did a couple of weeks ago when they asked the American people essentially some of the questions that are being posed by some of the other national polling media outlets; for example, do you think the Republicans are cutting Medicare too much? Not surprising, a majority of Americans said ``yes.'' But when we explain to them in our poll what the numbers really were and that we were actually increasing total Medicare spending from something like $189 billion a year to $278 billion a year over only 7 years per year and---- "", 'Mr. ENSIGN.', ' And per person. ', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' On a per capita basis, per recipient spending actually increases from $4,800 a year this year to $7,000 a year. The interesting thing is when you tell the American people that, in one poll we did a few weeks ago, 63 percent, after they learned that information, after they heard the facts, they said you are increasing spending too much on Medicare. ', 'So I ', ""think once we get our side of the story told, what this chart basically demonstrates is, while the administration has been demagoging to a certain degree, our Medicare part B premiums plan, the truth of the matter is, if you extend it out to the seventh year, we are really only talking about a difference between our plan and the President's plan of $4.80 a year. Now, that is almost nothing. "", 'Mr. ENSIGN.', "" The difference between the President's plan and our plan, how many years does that save Medicare? We save Medicare to what year versus what? "", 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' With this chart, we are only talking about part B.

', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' I believe that is correct. The point is they have no interest in telling us anything than the truth. What they said was, unless the Congress gets serious about reforming the Medicare system, it is going to go bankrupt in 7 years. It will not be able to make the payments. I think everyone now acknowledges there is a serious problem. Again, we have advanced a plan which uses market-based reforms, which I think the American people can understand. [[', 'Page H ', '14152]] Essentially, one of the reasons they did not like the Clinton health care reform plans that came out a year and a half ago was they did not really believe the Federal Government could do a much more efficient job of running the health delivery system than the private sector. What we did was sort of change the whole notion. Let us see if we can use the things working so well in the private sector to help control costs in ', 'Medicare. I ', 'am absolutely confident our reform plans are going to work. More important than that, I am convinced seniors who decide to participate in some of these new Medicare-plus programs that we are putting together and allowing to operate, I think, in the end of just a few years, many of them are going to say, ``', 'Yes, I ', ""like this plan much better than what we had before,'' because they are going to have options, they are going to have choices, they are going to be treated like human beings, just like everybody else out there. "", 'Mr. ENSIGN.', ' You received just recently, like I did, like virtually every other Member of Congress and every Federal employee did during this enrollment period now, where we decide by January which plan we are going to have; I am holding up a card here and this card is a Blue Cross/Blue Shield card. You have the same card. Over 90 percent of the Members of the House of Representatives have this card. The Speaker of the House has this very same card. What we are talking about here is something called a PPO. Seniors in the United States today do not have the same option to choose the health insurance that you and I have to choose, the same as the Speaker of the House has to choose. What we are doing, and, by the way, a PPO is managed care. The vast majority of Americans do not understand that a PPO is actually managed care. It is a very good managed care. We are going to give the seniors options to be able to choose a PPO, just like you and I have the option each year to choose a PPO, and HMO, fee-for-service, medical savings accounts or these new things called provider sponsor organizations. Can you imagine, imagine this scenario, let us say we had all of those options currently in Medicare, can you imagine what would happen, what ', 'AARP ', 'would say to Members of Congress if we took a whole list of options that seniors had and now tried to reverse it and say no, no, no, we have got a better system for you; instead of having all of those options and all of those things, you can choose from each year, we are going to give you fee-for-service; in a couple of areas of the country we will give you HMOs. That is all you get. Can you imagine the uproar? ', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' They would not stand for it. ', 'Mr. ENSIGN.', ' We would have 34 million seniors marching on Washington tomorrow. That is exactly, I mean, if people think about it in that context, we are giving them more choices, more freedoms. The chart you hold up is only people that stay in fee-for-service, and the people that choose PPOs, many of them will actually have less out-of-pocket expenses because they will not have, or these companies will be able to pay their Medicare part B premiums. They may get prescription drug coverage. I have three grandmothers on Medicare. It is absolutely heartbreaking. ', 'Luckily, I ', 'am able to help some of my grandmothers, with different members of our family help, and sometimes if it was not for that, they would have to choose between what they ate that month and getting prescription drugs. Many seniors are in this same boat. What we want to do is be able to offer seniors in all parts of the country so many choices they will have that option so they do not have to make the choice between what they eat that month and between getting prescription drugs. ', 'So I ', 'think we just have to put the politics aside. Who cares whether it is Democrats, whether it is Republicans? We have to put the politics aside and do what is right for this country. ', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' The American people, I think, understand this. In fact, when you talk about health care reform, if you look at what has happened in the private sector over the last number of years, we have literally seen the reforms with the various kinds of managed care and much more sophisticated kinds of managed care which are doing an incredibly good job of controlling the growth in health care costs. As a matter of fact, in the State of Minnesota, where we have probably more managed care than virtually any other State in the Union, we have seen health care costs over the last 18 months increasing at only about 1.1 percent. If you look at the private or at the public sector side, if you look at Medicare or Medicaid, we have had health care inflation at a rate of 10.5 percent. So the truth of the matter is we absolutely know that managed care will work. It will help control costs. But more important than that, in the State of Minnesota, we had a study that was done where they interviewed over 17,000 recipients of health care and asked them about how satisfied they were with their health care, and the interesting thing was among seniors who were already in some kind of managed care, their satisfaction with the plan that they have is 3 times greater than those who were in the standard Medicare fee-for-service plan. So it is not just about saving costs. It is not just about squeezing out some of the waste and mismanagement which we know is there. I think the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Fox] has done more to study the whole issue of waste, fraud and abuse in the health care system than anybody. I think if you create these managed care systems and create competition out there, we are going to attack that waste, fraud and abuse so we have more health care for fewer dollars. ', 'Mr. FOX ', 'of ', 'Pennsylvania. I ', 'appreciate your leadership as well as the gentleman from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] as well as the gentleman from California [Mr. Cunningham]. We can achieve savings we want by making sure we attack for the first time that health care fraud. Medicare fraud is $30 billion a year. By getting that savings, by offering choice, reducing paperwork costs and making sure we have an efficient system, health care will be preserved for our seniors under Medicare, and we can balance the budget, and I know that the gentleman from California [Mr. Cunningham] from his own experience can tell us about parts of the balanced budget amendment and the Balanced Budget Act that relates to his district, if he could join us in this discussion for that purpose. ', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' He is not a freshman, but we will allow him in on this debate, the gentleman from San ', 'Diego, CA ', '[Mr. Cunningham]. ', 'Mr. CUNNINGHAM.', ' If you remember, it was our freshman class when I went aboard 5 years ago that had the gang of 7 that closed down the House bank, that found out they were selling cocaine downstairs here, and brought the check scandal to fruition. I think it was the first radical group to come in to make change, and the sophomore class followed, and the 75 young Turks that came in after that have done a bang-up job. I thank you for yielding, and one of the things I would like to talk to is that, you know, some of the more radical Members on the other side of the aisle say that, well, we are cutting education, we are cutting the environment, we are cutting, hurting senior citizens. Unfortunately, this place is about power. It is about the power to be reelected. The power to be reelected over the last 40 years means the power to disburse money from the Federal Government down to the lower ranks so they are going to vote for you so you can get reelected so that you have got the power, and to support that you need the big bureaucracy to support the flow of the money so you can get reelected so you have got the power. What we are doing, and I think the American people would have a legitimate complaint if this Congress and the Republicans were trying to shift that power to the Republican Party, but the whole agenda and a balanced budget amendment and the agenda that we are trying to do is take that power not to Republicans but to the American people, to the States, where it can be more effectively used. We believe that government works closest to the people and it works best there. [[', 'Page H ', '14153]] You will hear over and over and over again by more liberal Members from Congress here that this is the only place that those decisions can be made. The States cannot make those decisions because in the past they have failed and that they are the only ones that can tell the American people how to do their business. That is a good issue. ', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' That is so important because I think there is sort of this argument that if we do not do the spending, if we do not do the regulating, if we do not do not the controlling, it will not get done. This is not a debate about how much money is going to be spent on education, how much money is going to be spent on nutrition or how much is going to be spent on health care. This is really a fundamental debate about who going to do the spending and who can do it more efficiently. Wht we are really talking about, as you say, you said it so well, is returning more of that decisionmaking back to the States and, more importantly, wherever possible and with the $500 per child tax credit, giving it back to the families because families are much more efficient than local governments, and local governments are much more efficient than State governments, and State governments are far more efficient than Federal Governments. That is why we are talking about welfare reform. We need to talk a little more about that because, again, I think the American people are so far out in front of us it is not even funny. I think they know the welfare system that has been created, controlled, directed, and regulated by the Federal Government has been an abysmal failure. They do not have to go very far in any direction, particularly if they come to this city, to see the results of 30 years of the social welfare state. As a matter of fact, here in ', 'Washington, DC,', ' if we go 10 blocks literally in any direction from this Capitol, you will see the results of 30 years of the social welfare state, and the results are devastating and not just in terms of the total costs. We all know we have spent over $5 trillion over the last 30 years, but the real cost is in the human cost because we have replaced self-reliance and families with debt, dependency and despair, and that is what the American people want changed. They know the real way is to send it back to the States through block grants to allow local communities and local individuals to help those who need the help. ', 'Mr. CUNNINGHAM.', ' Let me be very specific. I would like, Mr. Speaker, for you to listen to these figures because they are accurate and they are important in this debate. The Federal Government only supports 7 percent of education funding, 7 percent. 93 percent of all education is paid for out of State tax dollars. Now, of that 7 percent that we send to States, it occupies over 50 percent of the rules and regulations and burden on the State itself. It represents 75 percent of the paperwork that the State and the schools have to go through that tie up portions of the 93 cents that comes out of the State tax dollars. ', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' Say that again. I think that needs to be repeated. That it is a powerful set of statistics. ', 'Mr. CUNNINGHAM.', "" It is. It is very accurate. It is accurate for any State you go into. We happen to have one in eight Americans lives in the State of California. It is the same for any one of the States. The Federal Government only provides 7 percent of the funding for education. 93 percent, or 93 cents out of every dollar, comes out of the State. But yet of that 7 cents, 50 percent of the rules and regulations that tie up the State comes out of that 7 percent of funding from the Federal Government, 75 percent of the paperwork, and by getting back, and for example, my colleague says, well, you look, you cut out Goals 2000, you cut out all the funds for Goals 2000, what a great program. Well, if I send the money directly to the State and the State likes Goal 2000, the Governors have told us they can do a Goals 2000 program much more efficiently. They do not have the Federal rules and regulations, and they will argue, well, it is all voluntary. In the Goals 2000 bill there are 48 instances that say ``States will,'' and requires reporting, requires paperwork, and guess what, on the other end it takes Federal bureaucrats to take in that information, to record it and so on. My wife is a principal. She has to write grants for Goals 2000, and they receive some of the dollars. Many of the schools set up and hire people to write grants. They do not get the dollars, in most cases. Even in the cases they do, quite often, if it is not a larger school, the amount of dollars they get is not as much as it costs to pay the grant writer and to perform the rules and the regulations and the paperwork that comes back to "", 'Washington, DC.', ' {time} 2100 So when they say we are cutting, we are actually providing more dollars and more efficiency to the States. And those savings; guess what? Those savings go to balance the budget, and in the case of the education bill, Mr. Speaker, some of those savings went up to NIH for medical research on ', 'AIDS,', ' and heart disease, and some of the things that I believe most people in America believe are of national interest and that the Federal Government is the one that can host. ', 'So I ', ""get kind of upset when they say that we are cutting education, and they say I think the gentleman covered the student finances and the student loans. We are providing more money for student loans than ever in the history. But guess where the savings come from? The President's bill on direct lending, and I would like to give you, Mr. Speaker, some accurate figures as well, if I can find them here, that what the costs of the President's direct lending costs us. The President asks, or the President's costs, cost $1 billion over the next 7 years more than private student loans, $1 billion for the direct loan period, and guess what? CBO and OMB have not even calculated what it costs to collect those loans. That is just the distribution of it. So when we say---- "", 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' That is just the overhead. ', 'Mr. CUNNINGHAM.', ' Just the overhead, $1 billion more than sending it to the private enterprises, but yet our colleagues say, well, that is only for the rich, that is for your loan guys, and that is for your banks. ', 'Well, I ', 'can do something cheaper and better and provide more loans to the students that really need them, and the Pell grants which have been increased higher than any other level in the time of history, then I think that is better, instead again of having the Federal Government up here being able to dole out the money, and guess what? That direct student loan program, the President wanted billions more dollars to increase it by fourscore, and that would make the Department of Education the biggest lending entity in the world, I mean other than the World Bank, and that is what they want. They want that power of the Federal dollars to come down so that they can say, well, look at the grant that I gave you here. But they forget one thing, Mr. Speaker. They forget where the money came from in the first place. It is not their money. They take if from the very people, send it up here, and let me give you another accurate figure, Mr. Speaker, and this is one for my colleague to remember also. Only 23 cents out of every dollar that comes to Washington gets back into the classroom, 23 cents on every dollar. ', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' That is a pretty poor return on the investment. ', 'Mr. CUNNINGHAM.', ' Only 30 cents in welfare gets down to the recipients that really need the welfare check because of all the bureaucracy. Now my colleagues on the other side of the aisle or this side of the aisle, or the American public, you cannot run a business like that, and what the Governors have come to us and said is let us have the dollars, you do not want children to go hungry, you want the needy to be taken care of, you want the help. But you have got 144-some welfare programs, you have got 250 education programs. Let us set our own State standards, give us the money, do away with the Federal requirements and the bureaucracy, and we can make it more efficient. And guess what? We can apply those savings to the deficit and reduce, and what you have been talking about, what Alan Greenspan said, is that interest rates have already come down 2 percent. Why? Because the lending institutions for the first time in over 40 years believe that Congress is serious about [[', 'Page H ', '14154]] balancing the budget, and if that expectation goes away, those interest rates would not only go back to where they were, they will spiral upward and upward, and then look what it costs for a student loan in the increased interest. Look what it costs for a home with increased interest. I do not know about you, but most Americans, when interest rates came down, they refinanced their home, and I would encourage you, Mr. Speaker, if you have not done it already, take a serious look because it is going to be cheaper on your payments, and what does that mean? It means more dollars in the pockets of the American people. And these are some of the things on education, and I have a special order later tonight that I want to go through in depth some of these same issues on education and go through grant by grant, loan by loan, education bill and education program by education program and show what we have really done. If you say cut at a Federal level, yes, I will zero out any program I can at a Federal level and pass it on down to the State because I think and believe from the bottom of my heart it is much more efficient, it is closer to the people, and they can decide better where those dollars will be used, and I think that is what we are trying to do here. ', 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', "" The examples you have given, Congressman Cunningham, are so good, and frankly I think the American people instinctively understand just what you have talked about tonight. They understand that what we really need to do is localize, and privatize, and downsize this Federal Government, and that is what we are trying to do, and when they talk about cuts in education, we are talking about moving more of that educational decisionmaking back to the States, local units, and to families where they can make their own decisions about what they are going to do with their kids and the schools that they have, and frankly I think every American family understands this. They care much more about their kids' education than some bureaucrat in Washington. You know we can all talk about caring, and everybody talks about compassion, but real caring and real compassion happens around the kitchen table. It is families that care most about their kids' education, and that is what we want to get back to, and the waste and mismanagement here in this city, as I say, is just awesome, and I know you are going to talk a little bit about Bosnia, and I want to hear a little more, and I see Congressman Dornan is here tonight as well to talk a little bit about military affairs, and I believe in a strong defense, but just look at the Defense Department and the amount of waste, and duplication, and mismanagement that we see, and I know that your other colleague from San Diego once told me, Congressman Hunter, about how many buyers they have at the Pentagon.

The duck comes down and you win 50 bucks? But he talked about how may buyers, and it is like 106,000 buyers in the Department of Defense. We have 1,646 buyers for every F-16 we buy, and we buy 1 or 2 a week, something like that, and it is replete throughout the Federal Government. We all know that, the people that we serve know that, and the interesting thing, and we talked a little bit earlier about the megapoll that we did; it just confirms, I think, the common sense we all have, and that is once the American people understand what we are doing, once they see how much we are actually going to be spending, if anything the criticism is that we are still spending too much. Our budget calls for almost $12.1 trillion worth of spending over the next 7 years, and if you divide that up, it works out to over $46,500 in Federal spending for every man, woman, and child in the United States. Let me say that again. Over the next 7 years, Mr. Speaker, our budget plan, which the President vetoed today as cutting too much, will spend $46,500 for every man, woman, and child in the United States. Now what we are saying, I think in very simple language, we believe the $12.2 trillion is more than enough to fund the legitimate needs of this Federal Government and to take care of those people who depend on the Federal Government for various services; $12.1 trillion is more than enough. $13 trillion will bust the bank, and it will bust the taxpayers. In fact I think, if we can get the American people to look more at the facts of our budget, I think they will come to the same conclusion that we have come to, and that is that our budget is fair, it is reasonable, it is responsible, and it is long overdue. And so I think the budget that we are talking about is one that is good for the American people. As you said, long term it is going to bring interest rates down even more so Americans will have more of their own money to spend. They will not have to spend so much in interest. It will make student loans more available and more affordable. In fact the average family, according to Alan Greenspan, if we can stay on this balanced-budget plan over the next 7 years, the average family with a $100,000 mortgage--in fact the average mortgage in the State of Minnesota is $93,600--they will save almost $3,000 a year in interest as opposed to what they would have spent or will spend if we do not really get serious about---- ', 'Mr. CUNNINGHAM.', "" They can use it for their child's education, for medical bills, first-time home buyers, or they can even put it away for an IRA to save for when they become chronologically gifted folks.

Let the people make their own decisions, let them spend their own money, because we think they can spend it more efficiently than this Federal Government.

But what I would like to go through, Mr. Speaker, is what I found is many of the Members on the other side of the aisle, as well as Members on this side of the aisle, are concerned about the other issues that we have talked about, budget debate and across the board. They do not serve on National Security. They are not directly involved with the Bosnia issue, but it is of great concern to them, and they do not have the time to really go out and find out the information. ', 'What I ', 'would like to do first is kind of set the stage, if my friend, the gentleman from California [Mr. Dornan] would allow me, to just kind of go through and name the players. Later on in the evening I would like to go through the history of the portions of the world that we are talking about going into in Bosnia, from over 600 [[', 'Page H ', ""14155]] years ago on the Field of Flowers and the time of Hugo through the revolution where Nazis invaded Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslavia, back in the 1940's. First of all I would like to go through the players, Mr. Speaker, because, as I said, many people do not associate names, places, religions, with individual groups. For example, Alija Izetbegovic; he is a Bosnian Muslim, but when someone talks about talking about Sarajevo or Bosnia and Herzegovina, they do not necessarily tie the two together. So Izetbegovic is a Bosnian Muslim that is primarily responsible in the Bosnia and Herzegovina area, and primarily Sarajevo, which is where there are headquarters. Now Izetbegovic, like Tudjman, who is a Croatian, is of Roman Catholic descent, and you talk about Zagreb when you talk about that particular portion of their Croatian nationalism. They also during World "", 'War II,', ' if you take a look at the two groups, their Croatians fought alongside with Nazi Germany, and they were called the Ustase. They formed the only Nazi concentration camp outside of Germany where they executed and ethnically cleansed over a million and a half Serbs, Jews, and gypsies at one time, and if you take a look also at Franjo Tudjman, Croatian, Roman Catholic, Zagreb, the World ', 'War II ', 'association was with the Ustase in Nazi Germany. If you look at Slobodan Milosevic, we talk about he is the head of Serbia, not Bosnian Serb, but Serbia, greater Serbia itself. That is a group of Orthodox Catholics. The difference between the two groups; one is Orthodox Catholic, the other is Roman Catholic in the religious affiliations, and of course Milosevic is in Belgrade, and if you look at that portion of the world during World ', 'War II,', ' there were three basic groups: the Chetniks which fought under Mihailovic, the Ustase, which were associated with the Nazi Germans, and then you had a well-known man named Tito. He was with the partisans, which was a group of people that fought with the greater Russian Communists. Mihailovic fought for greater Yugoslavia, Tito fought for communism and a greater Russia, so that there is a big conflict, not a conflict but a misunderstanding, of the players and where they really came from. {time} 2115 Let me go into also the number of troops under this agreement that will be placed into Bosnia. Great Britain has come up with 13,000 troops, France 7,500 troops, Spain 4,000, Italy 2,000, Germany 4,000, other ', 'NATO ', 'countries 2,500, Russia 2,000 troops; and the United States, where they say 20,000 troops, the actual number of troops there, and that will be deployed, will be 32,000 troops, not 20,300 troops. Let me go through, and then I would yield back over to my friend, if he likes, let me go over some of the history perspectives of the area, Mr. Speaker. ', 'As I ', 'said, many people that are not historians, that have not looked at the issues, have not read the books, they have not gone through the list of that portion of the world. As early as 1389, and let me repeat that so there is no confusion, 1389 on the Field of Blackbirds, some call it the Field of Flowers, saw the Serbian Empire defeated by the Turks. By the end of June, the time of Yugo, former Yugoslavia was dominated by the Turkish Moslems. June 28 today is celebrated much like our Fourth of July in Bosnia, as Independence Day, because it was 600 years of domination of the Ottoman Turks. That is how the same basic ethnic group changed from Serbian to Croatian to Moslem, and the Moslem came from the Turkish Moslem, the Suni Moslem. ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' If the gentleman will yield for a 1-minute elaboration, ', 'Duke, I ', 'found out that no matter how good I am or you are, some of our supporters out there have said sometimes a dialog is good. It gets the juices going. We cannot tell the colonel in the chair there, our good Marine Speaker pro tem, to get a cup of coffee or tea, but I am telling people if they want to continue to listen to you, they are going to learn something from you and from me tonight, as they just learned a lot from the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Gutknecht]. I want to flesh this out. This is not a movie, they must listen to us. Let me flesh out why Serbians treat as though it were 2 years ago the battle in the Field of Blackbirds at Kosovo Poije. Here is what happened. Prince Lazar, a tall, handsome Serbian knight, sets up to do battle with the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. He had 400 concubines in Topkapi; interesting place when people go to Istanbul to visit the blue mosque, hundreds of years old, and Hagia Sofia, built by, oh, my gosh, Justinian up here in the corner in 532. The Sultan had reigned for 29 years. Roosevelt got a fourth term, and about 82 days into a 13th year. Thirty-nine years, Sultan Murad, sounds like something for the eyes, ', 'Murad I ', ""ruled for 29 years. The Serbs were winning, and a Serbian noble, Miloc, that is why so many children are named Milo or Milan or Miloc, Miloc Kobolic pretends to be a deserter-- what you guys in Vietnam called the chu hoi program, come over to our side--in all his knightly armor and garb, a swashbuckling figure, for the mind to conjure this up and know that it is better than anything they do in Hollywood with their fake violence and untrue stories, just a will to fiction. He works his way into the tent of a 29-year ruling Sultan and stabs him to death with a poison dagger. He dies a violent death of torture, and for a while it was pandemonium. It looked like the Serbs had won the day, yet again to save Christendom from the Islamic forces that had gone all the way across North Africa, across the Strait of Gibraltar and conquered most of Spain, driving out, if they would not convert, and killing the Christians and ending the Christendom of St. Augustine in all of North Africa. His son, Sultan Murad's son Bayezid, rallies his forces and inflicts a crushing defeat on the Serbs. They capture and torture to death the leader, Prince Lazar. The Serbs are then forced to pay tribute for decades, turn over many of their women, and promise to do military service in now young Sultan Bayezid's forces for decades. Then the second Battle of Kosovo is fought 59 years later, and the Serbs again almost win. The old date is 15 June, like Waterloo, but you are right, 28 June. And where have we heard that date on this floor before? 28 June 1914 caused "", 'George M.', "" Cohen to write ``Over There,'' ``And we won't be back till it's over over there,'' and my dad gets three Purple Hearts, then wound chevrons, poison gas, 11 million of the flower of European youth killed. That started not too far from Kosovo, to the west a little bit, in the city of Sarajevo where a 19-year-old knowing that if he was going to be hit man, he had to move fast, because if he turned 20 he would have gotten capital punishment. And Gavrilo Princip at 19, in Sarajevo, on a street much narrower than the distance between the gentleman and me, he shoots to death the Archduke Ferdinand of the Austral-Hungarian Empire, the heir-apparent, his beautiful wife Sofia, nicks the driver of this big car. And the killing is on, and it has not stopped for this whole bloody era. That is why, when you speak for the Serbs, and you jumped on me a little bit yesterday because in the abbreviated time I'm trying to be fair to Serbs, Croatians, and Moslems here, but the Serbs saved Christendom, as did the Hungarians, as did the Austrians, as did a whole area of southern Europe, held the line, saved Vienna, saved Malta, won the Battle of Leponto in 1571, that is almost two centuries later. This went on for half of this millenium we are ending in 4 years. Just wanted to know, fact is better than fiction. "", 'Mr. GUTKNECHT.', ' Mr. Speaker, if I could reclaim my time, my hour is going to expire quickly and then you guys are going to have at it for another hour. ', 'But I ', 'just want to say that I think this is important. I said earlier that facts are stubborn things. ', 'And I ', 'think it was Patrick Henry who said that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. The American people need to get plugged into this discussion, whether we are talking about Bosnia or the budget, because I think the American people in many respects are going to be the final arbiters of this debate. I thank you so much for sharing with us the history, because the more you learn about that region, the more you learn about this agreement, the more you learn about what is going on over there, the more troubling this whole story becomes. The real trouble is they are going to be our kids, and they are just kids for [[', 'Page H ', '14156]] the most part. You see them out here exercising with the various honor guards and color guards and so forth, and you cannot help but feel proud of them. But many of those kids are going to get hurt, they are going to get killed, they are going to get wounded. The American people need to tune into this debate because facts are stubborn things, and the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. The American people, I hope, will be tuned into your discussion as you go on for the next hour. ']"

Mr. Speaker, 33 Americans were taken from us far too early in the plane that crashed April 3 near Dubrovnik. This morning, we paid tribute to our good friend, Secretary Ron Brown. At this time, I want to commemorate one of those brave souls traveling with the Secretary, Mr. David L. Ford. David Ford was one of 12 American business executives accompanying Secretary Brown on a mission with the most noble goal of helping the people of Bosnia and Croatia to rebuild their war-ravaged countries. An executive with Guardian Industries, headquartered in Michigan, David was to donate 23 metric tons of flat glass to Sarajevo, enough to produce about 8,000 windows for use in rebuilding the Bosnia capital. After the trade mission ended in tragedy, the glass was delivered to Sarajevo as planned and donated to the people by the U.S. Embassy. David Ford's career at Guardian began in 1971, and he spent time at its facilities around the country, including several years at the Guardian plant in Carleton, MI, in my congressional district. He helped lead his company's expansion into the European market, and at the time he was taken from us he headed Guardian's European operations. We will remember David Ford as a successful businessman, but more importantly, his wife and two children will remember him as a loving husband and devoted father. He was a deeply religious man, who before his passing was able to provide some desperately needed relief to the people of Sarajevo. There, his final effort will be honored by a plaque.

PAT DANNER of missouri in the house of representatives Tuesday, December 12, 1995 Ms. DANNER. Mr. Speaker, I continue to have grave reservations about the United States' mission to Bosnia and this concern is reflected in my votes on this issue. I do not believe we should agree to the placement of American men and women in harm's way without the support of the American people, which I do not believe exists. I fear that the mission could result in a significant loss of American lives without accomplishing the goal of peace in the Balkans. I have listened closely to the arguments made in support of sending troops. I have not yet been convinced that the parties to the agreement are completely willing to accept the terms of the agreement, nor am I convinced that they have complete control over the people they represent. One of my chief concerns with the peace agreement continues to be the individual interpretations of the terms by the leaders. For example, Croat authorities released a jailed military commander who was under indictment by the international war crimes tribunal for atrocities. This action knowingly violated one of the major provisions of the Balkan peace agreement. This type of blatant and self-serving disregard for the terms of the agreement certainly does not bode well for the peace agreement and the United States mission. Because of this, I am concerned that a mission intended to keep the peace could quickly become a military engagement similar to what transpired in Somalia. In closing, however, it is important to note that like the many other Americans opposed to the mission, I will be supportive of our troops as they are committed to Bosnia.

19,"HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 96TH CIVIL AFFAIRS BATTALION AT FORT BRAGG ______ HON. CHARLIE ROSE of north carolina in the house of representatives Friday, August 4, 1995 Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, on August 17, 1995, the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne) at Fort Bragg will celebrate the 50th anniversary of its activation. I would like take a moment to recognize the 96th, which, incidentally, just happens to be the U.S. Army's only active duty civil affairs unit. The battalion has had a long and distinguished history. The 96th Civil Affairs Battalion is descended from the 96th Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, Military Government Group, which was constituted at the Presidio in Monterey, CA on August 25, 1945, and activated the following day. This unit was inactivated on January 25, 1949, in Korea. On May 10, 1967, the unit was redesignated the 96th Civil Affairs Group and allotted to the regular Army. It was activated on August 25, 1967 at Fort Lee, VA. On November 26, 1971, the group was reorganized and redesignated the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion at Fort Bragg, NC ever since. The last redesignation took place on March 1, 1986, when the battalion was placed on Airborne status and renamed the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne). The quiet professionals of the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne) continue a tradition, developed over the past 50 years, of being premier ambassadors for both the U.S. Army and the United States of America. Today the soldiers of the 96th are deployed around the world in Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, Rowanda, Hatii, Grenada, Panama, Honduras, Wake Island, Cambodia, and Mongolia, where they serve to advise officials of foreign nations in various aspects of civil- military operations and humanitarian relief. Above all, the men and women who serve in the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne) help build and strengthen the cause of democracy. For this, we owe them a debt of gratitude. I would like to extend to everyone who serve and have served in the 96th my thanks and the thanks of the U.S Congress for your fine work.

Today the soldiers of the 96th are deployed around the world in Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, Rowanda, Hatii, Grenada, Panama, Honduras, Wake Island, Cambodia, and Mongolia, where they serve to advise officials of foreign nations in various aspects of civil- military operations and humanitarian relief. Above all, the men and women who serve in the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne) help build and strengthen the cause of democracy. For this, we owe them a debt of gratitude. I would like to extend to everyone who serve and have served in the 96th my thanks and the thanks of the U.S Congress for your fine work. Congratulations on your 50th anniversary, 96th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne), and I encourage you to keep up the good work for another 50 more. ']"
20,"JUSTIFICATION FOR SENDING UNITED STATES TROOPS TO BOSNIA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Weldon] is recognized for 60 minutes. Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to discuss an issue that is going to confront us for the next several weeks in regard to the President's intention to send 20,000 to 25,000 of America's sons and daughters to the Balkans to participate in living up to the terms of the agreement just recently initialed in Dayton, OH. Mr. Speaker, like many Americans across the country, I sat before my television set last evening and listened intently as President Clinton gave his justification to the American people for sending ground troops into Bosnia. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks from tomorrow I was invited to the Pentagon, where I had breakfast with Secretary Perry and the leadership of the Joint Chiefs, including General Shalikashvili, where they made a personal case to me and other Members of the Committee on National Security as to why we should commit our troops to Bosnia in light of the pending peace agreement, which had not yet been initialed. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to respond, first of all, to President Clinton's speech, because parts of it bothered me greatly, and to lay the foundation for a hearing which our committee will hold on Thursday when again Secretary Perry, General Shalikashvili, and Secretary Christopher will come before the House Committee on National Security and again make the case to us to support the President's efforts. Mr. Speaker, as someone who has been on the Committee on National Security for 9 years and who chairs the Research and Development Subcommittee, I am vitally interested in any place or any time that we send our troops into harm's way, whether it be the time that we sent them to Desert Storm, or Haiti, or other operations around the world. Mr. Speaker, I was taken aback by some of the comments President Clinton made in the speech yesterday evening and I have to respond to them, and this is the only opportunity where I can deal with them in a lengthy and involved format. I want to respond to three specific points that the President made to the American people and to Members of this body. I want to, first of all, respond to his assertion that those who disagree with him are isolationists and want us to come back into our own borders and not be a part of the world community. The second issue I want to take exception to is the way that he characterized the moral argument involved in getting involved in Bosnia. And the third is the President's comparison of Bosnia and our potential involvement there to Haiti and Somalia as well as Desert Storm. Then I want to get into my own specific concerns relative to a potential vote that we may take in this body a week or two from now. First of all, Mr. Speaker, let me respond to the contention made by President Clinton that those who may oppose his policy here are isolationists. Mr. Speaker, the fact is that for the past 3 years, a strong bipartisan voice in this body and the other body have voted repeatedly, have signed letters, have sent messages to the White House and the administration that we want to be a part of the process of helping achieve peace in the Balkans. And, in fact, Mr. Speaker, I, like many of my colleagues in this body today, would support the presence of the United States in a somewhat limited way in the Balkans, as we have done repeatedly over the last 3 years. After all, Mr. Speaker, there were many Members of both the majority and minority parties that supported the President's use of our Air Force in terms of the air strikes. Many of us have supported logistical support to provide food and clothing and humanitarian support and relief to the people of the Balkans. So time and again over the past 3 years Members of this body and the other body have made it clear that we want to be involved. And, in fact, Mr. Speaker, as I said to the Secretary of Defense 2- weeks ago, I am prepared to support American troops in Bosnia tomorrow, but not on the ground. And, Mr. Speaker, that is the key issue that President Clinton completely ignored last evening. He made it appear as if we are in disagreement with him on his policy; that, therefore, we must not want the United States to be involved at all, and that is absolutely totally wrong. I think it was really shortsighted of the President to make that statement to the American people. In fact, what I proposed to Secretary Perry, I think, would be supported by many of our colleagues in this body; and that is, why should America have to put 20,000 to 25,000 ground troops in between three warring factions that have been at war not for 4 years and not for one decade but for decades and decades and centuries and centuries? Why should the European countries, who are the bordering nations to Bosnia, not step up with that ground support force and let the United States involvement be what we do very well; airlift, sealift, air strikes, command and control, intelligence gathering and monitoring, and all the other ancillary support to make this mission a success? In fact, Mr. Speaker, when the President talks about a U.S. commitment of 20,000 to 25,000 troops, he is not being realistic with the American people nor is he being realistic with our colleagues in this body. As a matter of fact, right now, Mr. Speaker, we have an estimated 15,000 troops who are providing support services in the theater around Bosnia. These services range from airlift and sealift to intelligence gathering, to all kinds of functions that they have been assigned by the Pentagon, just to name a few of the assignments that our military is currently involved in in the European theater, and this is, by the way, not complete. We have Operation Able Sentry going on right now. We have Operation Deny Flight. We have Operation Provide Province, Operation Sharp Guard, and Operation Provide Comfort. All of those operations are, today, involving American troops in the theater that the President is talking about sending ground troops in. In fact, along with the ground troops that President Clinton is proposing, we are going to have a carrier, the America, off the coast. We are going to have Navy pilots and Navy personnel available. So our total support forces, besides the 20,000 to 25,000 ground troops, is going to be somewhere between 13,000 and 17,000. When I met with the Secretary 2 weeks ago, I tried to pin he and General Shalikashvili to a specific number, and I will do that again this Thursday. I asked them, how many other U.S. troops will be involved in this effort? They would not give me a specific answer. To the best of my ability, I have determined that number will be somewhere above 15,000. So when the President goes before the American people as he did last night and says, I want to send 20,000 troops in, that is our commitment, what he should have said is, I want to have 35,000 or perhaps 40,000 U.S. troops involved in the theater of operation that includes, as our overall mission, Bosnia and the maintaining of the peace agreement that was initiated in Dayton. Now, many of us in this body feel that what the President should have done is said we will provide that support in the form of airlift and sealift and use of our aircraft for attacks, if necessary, on selected sites, and command and control and intelligence gathering, but should not have had American troops placed in harm's way in an area of the world so far away from our shore and which many of us feel that we do not have a direct national interest. Many of us feel that it [[Page H 13726]] is unconscionable that those countries that directly surround the Balkans are only putting in small tokens of troops. Now, Mr. Speaker, we have not been able to get exact counts. These numbers have varied. But I went through the foreign media, through our FBIS reports we get, that we can request in our offices, to try to get a feel for what other countries are committing in the way of troops to this operation. I think it is important for our colleagues and for the American public to understand exactly what those commitments are and what, if any, strings are being attached, so that, when the President speaks about 25 nations being involved, we know really what he means and what these countries are actually saying. Great Britain, the United Kingdom, always our staunch ally, is in fact going to put up the largest complement of troops besides the United States. The Most recent number we have is about 13,000 troops compared to our 20,000. Now, Great Britain is very close to the Balkans, certainly much closer than the United States, and is obviously a part of the European theater. So you would expect them to put in place a large presence of military forces. Let us go to Germany. Here I have a problem, Mr. Speaker. The United States and the President are committing 20,000 ground troops and the ancillary support troops that I have just talked about numbering at least 15,000. The Germans have said that, and get this, Mr. Speaker, subject to the Bundestag's approval. In other words, we do not have to approve what the President wants to do in our Congress. He can send the troops on his own, which he said he would do with or without our vote of approval. But in Germany their commitment to send their troops will be predicated upon the support of the Bundestag. And how many troops are the Germans going to send in? Not 13,000, not 10,000, not 5,000, but 4,000. So Germany, right next to the Balkans, is going to send a total of 4,000 troops to the Balkans as their part of this operation. Now, quoting the minister in a German publication, the defense minister, who spoke on November 22, he went on to say that these 4,000 troops would be involved, and I quote, in terms of being logistical units, engineers, medical orderlies, transport units, helicopters, and aircraft to secure the airspace. Where is the commitment for the ground troops in the middle of the hostile parties? This is Germany's commitment. Then we go on to France. I remind our colleagues, Mr. Speaker, that France has a very real threat from the spread of the Bosnian operation, and France is very near and close to the proximity of the Balkan conflict and you would expect would be willing to put up a sizable amount of soldiers for this operation. France's commitment is currently listed in a most recent French publication of November 22 as 7,500 soldiers. This would be a part of the overall NATO deployment, but 7,500 soldiers. This is the same France that is only putting up 7,500 soldiers to our 20,000 that denied the United States the ability to fly our planes over France when we were going after Mu'ammar Qadhafi when Ronald Reagan was the President, in response to attacks he had made on American citizens. So France's commitment right now is listed at 7,500. Let us go to Spain, another European country. Let us see what Spain is talking about committing. This is from a radio network in Spanish in Madrid. Mr. Suarez Pertierra said it would be a tactical group of some 1,250 soldiers. So, while America is putting in 20,000 to 25,000 ground troops, Spain in talking about sending 1,250 soldiers to this operation. Let us look at Sweden. Sweden, another European country that obviously has an interest in seeing peace in that part of the world, has said that it will be part of a Nordic brigade that would have 900 Swedes. Now, Sweden also has a condition placed on its commitment. {time} 2300 And that condition is that the United Nations shall be financially responsible for this operation. So, Sweden is saying, ``Yes, we will go, but you pay our bill.'' I did not hear that said on the part of our commitment. We are going to pay the entire bill. Mr. Speaker, my guess is that this will end up much like Haiti. We not only paid for our expenses, but we will end up paying for the housing costs, the feeding, and logistical support for a number of other countries, all of which will be borne by the American taxpayers. But Sweden's troop commitment is right now 900. Then we go to Austria, and I will quote a news source from Vienna Television Network, November 21, where there is a quotation from the leadership of Austria about their commitment. Their consideration is for sending a force of 200 to 250 men. It goes on to say, quote, ``Volunteers, of course. No one is going to be forced to go into this.'' Mr. Speaker, 200 to 250 are going to be volunteers and they will not serve as combat troops. They will be there as a transport unit. Let us go on and talk about Italy, another European country that is expected to be a part of this operation. Look at what Italy's contribution will be. Initially, Italy balked when the press said that they heard rumors that 2,100 men would be sent, but now there is confirmation that the form will be 2,100. But Italian news media sources also go on to say that actually, and I quote, ``Parliament still has to give its approval to send out Italian troops.'' So, the United States Congress will not have the ability to approve the President's sending of not 20,000, but perhaps 35,000 troops into that theater; we will have the German Bundestag approve the German troops going in, and the Italian Parliament approve the Italian troops going in, but we will not have that ability in this country. The total commitment of Italy will be 2,100 men. The Netherlands, another European country. The Netherlands, according to its population, is perhaps contributing a larger element that we would expect. The Netherlands Cabinet wants to make a decision about sending 2,000 troops to help with the peace accord. Then we have Denmark. A Danish battalion is set to leave on January 8 as part of the NATO operation and they are talking about 807 men going from Denmark. Mr. Speaker, these are not my reports. These are all sources that I will provide to anyone in this body in terms of what our European allies in NATO are going to commit to this operation. Our point, Mr. Speaker, is not one of isolation. We want to be the leader of NATO, and we know we are. We continue to help our NATO allies every day. We have a strong presence in the European countries I have just mentioned. We have military bases there and Navy units deployed in the vicinity of those countries. We will be there for them. But, Mr. Speaker, Bosnia is largely a European problem and many of us in this body feel that while the United States must play a role, and that role can be air strikes, air support, sea life support, command and control, intelligence gatherings, and all the other logistical help that we should not have to go beyond that and put 20,000 young American sons and daughters in the middle of what could be a very hostile environment; what certainly has been a very hostile environment. So when the President talks, as he did last night, about isolationism, the President is totally, absolutely wrong. It is a slap in the face to every Member of this body that he would say his opponents are isolationists. In fact, many of us have said all along that we want us to be involved; we just do not want the United States to go it alone. That is what we think this President has gotten us into. My opinion is the President, to some extent, put his foot in his mouth earlier their year when he said to the NATO allied leaders, ``I will put ground troops in Bosnia if we get a peace agreement.'' What he should have said is, ``I will make a commitment,'' and left that up to the final negotiations in Dayton. He did not do that. Mr. Speaker, while the negotiations were going on, all of us in this body knew what was going to come out of those negotiations, and that was going to be taking the President up on his word, and that is to send 20,000 ground troops into Bosnia. That should never have been the negotiating position of this country in terms of our NATO involvement. [[Page H 13727]] It certainly is not the position of this Member, and I know many of my colleagues, that we should not be involved, nor should we be isolationists. The second issue I want to take up with the President is the way he characterized the morality argument here. He somehow tries to make the case that the Members of Congress who perhaps question what he wants to do here are not concerned about babies being killed, about ethnic cleaning, and about women being raped. Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. As a member of the Human Rights Caucus since I have been in this body, I have tirelessly, again and again, spoken out on behalf of human rights abuses. In fact, Mr. Speaker, in at least three votes in this body over the past 2 years, we have overwhelmingly told the President to lift the arms embargo so that the Bosnian people could defend themselves, so that they, in fact, could have a level playing field, so that we could stop the abuses and stop the ethnic cleaning and stop the rape and torturing. Every time this Congress, in a strong bipartisan manner, told the President to lift the embargo, the President said, ``no.'' Yet last night on national TV, the President tells the American people that he is really that one concerned about these kids being killed and these women being raped and the ethic cleaning. Well, Mr. Speaker, what were we doing the past 2 or 3 years with all of these votes and these letters and these issues where we came forward and said, ``You have got to do something, Mr. President, about what is happening in the Balkans,'' and he did nothing. Now, all of a sudden the solution to all of these problems is to spend 20,000 of our kids into the Balkans on the ground in the middle of this controversy. Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely no justification for the President to make the statement that he made last night that he is the only one concerned with the moral issue of why we should be involved. There are steps that we could have and should have taken over the last 2 years to help even the playing field in the Balkans and we did not do it. Not because the Congress would not act, but because the President would not listen. These were not just Republicans speaking. These were Republicans and Democrats. Some of the most eloquent leaders on lifting the arms sanctions and the arms embargo were on the minority side of the aisle; not just on the Republican side. What really bothered me about the speech that the President made last night, at the end, Mr. Speaker, was when he alluded to a conversation that he had with the Pope. I really though it was grasping for straws when President Clinton basically said, The Pope told me to do it. Mr. Speaker, I have the highest respect for the Vatican and for the Holy Father and for the leadership he provides for the world's Catholics. But, Mr. Speaker, to use a comment that supposedly have been attributed to the Pope as the political justification boggles my mind. As one of our colleagues on the House floor said today, perhaps the President will tell us that he is going to change his stand on abortion, because I am sure the Holy Father talked to him about the sanctity of life, but I do not see President Clinton following the advice of the Pope on that issue, yet quoting the Pope in terms of taking this action in the Balkans. The third issue I want to take exception with the President last night, Mr. Speaker, deals with his trying to compare the Balkans to what happened in Desert Storm and what happened in Haiti and Somalia. First of all, Mr. Speaker, there are few, if any, similarities. In Desert Storm we have a figure who was destined to take over a major part of the world and threaten the security of not just one country but a freedom-loving people in the Middle East, including the State of Israel, and threatening to create anarchy in that part of the world. President Bush went to great lengths to line up allied support. Mr. Speaker, remember, that the cost of Desert Storm was not just in American lives and dollars, because as every Member, every one of our colleagues knows, the entire cost of Desert Storm, over $52 billion, was borne by those nations that benefited from our involvement. It was not a case where the United States went over and paid the bill and enticed people to come in by saying, ``We will pay your soldiers and provide them food and give them shelter, just be a part of the team.'' Mr. Speaker, in Desert Storm the parties who benefited most provided the dollars. And, yes, we did have an interest and, yes, we responded. And, yes, President Bush came to this Congress and asked for us to have an up-or-down vote in both bodies. I might add, Mr. Speaker, not one Member of the Democratic leadership at that time stood up and spoke for nor voted for the effort to send our troops into Desert Storm. Not one. Yet I am sure when we have a debate on this floor, every one of those Members will get up and support President Clinton's actions. There is irony in that statement. The President compared it to Haiti. Mr. Speaker, Haiti is not turning out to be the success that he promised. What has happened is we have spent about $2 billion of the U.S. taxpayers' dollars, and while the President has boasted about the other countries being involved, when he fails to tell the American people is that we paid for the bulk of their housing, their food, and their allowance support, subsistence support, to come to Haiti to be a part of that operation. {time} 2310 So basically they were brought in because America agreed to foot the bill. The U.S. taxpayers agreed to foot the bill. And whether or not we have been successful in Haiti is still undetermined. There have been killings and assassinations down there on a regular basis. And many of us predict Haiti will go right back to the way it was once we have our presence totally removed from that country. Let us talk about Somalia, because perhaps here is what scares me the most, Mr. Speaker. Somalia is probably that area where we have been involved militarily that I think causes certainly me and many of our colleagues to feel most uncertain and concerned about what President Clinton wants to do in Bosnia. I remember well, Mr. Speaker, a meeting in mid-September, held in one of the largest meeting rooms in the basement of this building, when Secretary of Defense Aspin and Secretary Warren Christopher came into a meeting room filled with Members of Congress only. There were about 300 House and Senate Members there, after we had lost 18 young Americans who had been shot down over Mogadishu and had their bodies dragged through the streets because we did not have the backup troop support to go in and rescue them. When Les Aspin was asked why this happened, he eventually acknowledged that the commanding officer of the Somalian operation had in August requested additional backup support for our troops in that theater but that he and the administration denied that support. When asked why, Secretary Aspin said it was because of the hostile political environment inside the beltway, the first time since Vietnam that a political armchair decision in Washington affected military action in another part of the world. Mr. Speaker, I can guarantee you this, as a member of the Committee on National Security, President Clinton is not going to repeat what he did in Somalia. If he, in fact, is successful in sending 20,000 ground troops into Bosnia, which I am certain he will be, whether or not we have a vote, he has already said he is sending the troops in, we are going to be very careful and we are going to be strident that this President is not going to call the political shots of what our military officers do in that theater. Because if our troops are committed by this Commander in Chief, then those calls have to be made by the commanding officer in charge of the theater of operation in Europe. Commander Joulwon who has the highest respect of most every Member of this body who knows him and the military leadership who serves under him should and will be making those calls. And the one thing that we will be focusing on, since we will probably not be able to stop the President from asserting troops in Bosnia, will be to make sure that General Joulwon gets [[Page H 13728]] every bit of support that he needs to maintain the safety of our troops. We want to make sure that there is no second guessing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, as there was in Somalia, saying, General Joulwon, we cannot send in more troops, we cannot send you more equipment because it is not the right political climate in Washington. If this President follows through on his commitment to send 20,000 ground troops into Bosnia, then this President better be prepared to let General Joulwon call the shots in terms of what support he needs to protect our troops, even though many of us in this body, including myself, have great hesitation with any ground troops going into Bosnia whatsoever. Mr. Speaker, as I said a moment ago, most of us have resigned ourselves to the fact that we cannot stop the troops from being sent over there. The President is in fact the Commander in chief of our military. I acknowledge that. He has that function. He has the ability to commit our troops to any part of the world, even though twice in my lifetime, it has been this Congress, under Democrats, who have cut off funding for our military as a way to bring our troops back home from Vietnam and from Somalia. So this President will in fact send our troops. Whether we have a vote or not here will not matter. He has already ignored the will of the Congress in terms of lifting the arms embargo over the past 2 years, and he has already ignored the will of the Congress three times in the last 2 months. Because three times since August, Mr. Speaker, this body and the other body have taken specific votes to say to the President, do not commit ground troops. Aerial support, logistical support, other types of aerial attacks and other types of support that we can provide, okay, but do not commit ground troops. And those votes were overwhelmingly bipartisan. They were not Republicans. There were Democrats and Republicans together. What did President Clinton do? For the past 3 months he has ignored those votes. Even last week, the week before, before the agreement was initialed in Dayton, OH, this body again went on record saying, Mr. President, do not commit ground troops. He is going to send ground troops whether we have another vote or not. But what we will do in this body is, we will make sure that we do not have a repeat of the Clinton Somalia debacle where American kids who were sent to a foreign country are allowed to be put at risk and, in the case of Somalia, 18 of them coming home in body bags after their bodies were dragged through the streets of downtown Mogadishu. With every ounce of energy in my body, Mr. Speaker, that is not going to happen this time. The President may have his way in sending the troops in, but we who are on the Committee on National Security and those of us in the bipartisan manner in this Congress will work to make sure that our troops are given every possible means of support that they need with no second-guessing coming from the bureaucracy inside the Beltway here, letting our military leadership that has been assigned to this operation, in this case General Joulwon, make those decisions and have the full support he needs. Mr. Speaker, there are many other articles that I want to put in the Record and will do so either tonight or in special orders I will be taking out this week from news sources around the world where those people inside of the Balkans are questioning this agreement. We have to be aware of what the leadership in those countries are saying, not just what the three signatories to that agreement out in Dayton said, because they are three individuals. The question is, do they in fact represent the majority of the people in the Balkans? Are the people going to adhere? Are they going to cooperate with this peacekeeping force? If you read some of the FBIS articles that have come out over the past several days, I have grave concerns. Mr. Speaker, I would ask to enter into the Record an article that was printed in the Belgrade Nasa Borba in Serbo-Croatian, its November 22 edition, relative to the political parties and the peace accord and statements specifically that Serbian Radical Party President Vojislav Seselj exclaimed, and I quote, ``The biggest betrayal of the Serbian nation has just been committed.'' In stark opposition to the prevailing positive reactions to the agreement, Serbian Radical Party President Vojislav Seselj, according to BETA, exclaimed that ``the biggest betrayal of the Serbian nation has just been committed.'' I ask to include in the Record articles, again from FBIS reports, quoting a leading Bosnian Serb official Momcilo Krajisnik in terms of his refusal to sign on to the accord and explaining his opposition and how this agreement is a sellout of the Serbs. [FBIS Transcribed Text, Nov. 21, 1995] Plan ``Not Accepted'' by Serbs Sarajevo (AFP).--A senior Bosnian Serb official warned late Tuesday [21 November] that the peace accord agreed in Dayton, Ohio does not satisfy ``even a minimum'' of their demands. Quoted by the Bosnian Serb official media, ``parliamentary speaker'' Momcilo Krajisnik said: ``The agreement that has been reached does not satisfy even a minimum of our interests. Our delegation has not accepted the plan and we were unanimous on that.'' I also ask to include articles, again from the FBIS reports, from the Banja Luka Srpska Televizija, a TV station in Banja Luka, relative to the explanation of the accord and saying that, ``The people, the Serbs are not intimidated by the Dayton agreement, they are not intimidated by the Dayton agreement in terms of what it is going to do to their nation.'' Further go on to quote in the same article, we will never give up Sarajevo, dead or alive, let everyone know that. If I were able to talk to both Clinton and Christopher like our delegation that went to negotiate, I would tell them not to play with the Serbs. It goes on to further say, there is no Serb who would leave this and leave the Serb land behind. And it further goes on to say, they will not be frightened of the signatures from Dayton, speaking of the Serbs in Bosnia. [FBIS Translated Text, Nov. 23, 1995] Serbs in Sarajevo Await ``Explanation'' of Accord (Report by Draga Grubic) The signing of the Dayton peace agreement has recently engrossed the citizens of Serb Sarajevo as the event on which they pinned their hope and survival.

(Report by Angus MacKinnon) Brussels, Nov. 27 (AFP).--NATO on Monday [27 November] warned Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic that any attempt to intimidate the peace force the alliance plans to send to Bosnia would be greeted with an ``extremely robust'' response. Finally, Mr. Speaker, another editorial, written by Bela Jodal, ``Compulsory Hope,'' in a Budapest publication. This is a very important question he asks. ``Will it be the U.S. troops who left Somalia due to difficulties which were smaller than what can be expected in the Balkans?'' [FBIS Translated Text, Nov. 23, 1995] Editorial Doubts Future of Bosnian Peace Accord * * * * * Will it be the U.S. troops who left Somalia due to difficulties which were much smaller than what can be expected in the Balkans? Mr. Speaker, the key question we have to ask is, is what we are about to [[Page H 13729]] do and what this President is about to do in America's best interest? More importantly, Mr. Speaker, we, as elected Representatives of approximately 600,000 people each across this country, have to be able to ask ourselves the ultimate question: Can we go into that family's home when their son or daughter or mother or father or brother or sister are sent home as a casualty of this conflict and be able to justify the job and the mission that they did? {time} 2320 I am a strong supporter of our military, Mr. Speaker, and proudly so, and I will be a strong supporter if the President deploys them there. But I do not support the President's policy, and I do not believe he has made the case. Let me say in closing, Mr. Speaker, in coming to my conclusions 2 weeks ago I had to rely on a friend of mine who has been in Sarajevo for 3 years. His name is John Jordan. He is a Rhode Island volunteer firefighter. He went over to Sarajevo because he heard that the fire and emergency services personnel were being abused by the military even though they were trying to serve the Croats, Serbs, Muslems, all factions. He went over to volunteer to help them. He ended up staying 3 years. Mr. Speaker, he was featured by ABC-TV as their person of the week for the work that he did as a volunteer. He brought 50 other Americans over with him to help the Serbian fire brigade with Keenan Slimmick, who was the fire chief before he was assassinated. John Jordan was shot twice while he was in Sarajevo. He was beaten in the chest with the blunt end of a rifle. He had concussions, shrapnel wounds, but stayed there helping all of the various people in Sarajevo get decent medical protection and protection from fires and disasters. We sent an airlift of supplies over to him a year and a half ago., We sent three or four fire trucks, rescue equipment that had been donated from around the country, to help him perform this mission in Sarajevo of humanitarian aid to these people during the time this President did nothing to satisfy those concerns he spoke of last night. I asked John Jordan to come down to Washington to tell me what he thought we should do. John Jordan, American citizen, after 3 years in Sarajevo, gave me the following quote, Mr. Speaker, which appeared in an AP wire story on October 22 in regard to what we are going to face in Bosnia. Every one of us in this body have to understand in a context of the quotes I have given what John Jordan said will occur there: ``We're going to face some very, very ugly, heavily armed, prone-to- violence people who are totally unafraid of the United States,'' he said. ``I've had more than one Serb commander say to me, `I really wish the U.S. instead of the French were running the airport. If we can just get enough of you in one place at one time, we can kill 200 or 300 of you, you'll be out of this war forever, and you won't be a problem anymore. You'll leave just like you left Beirut.' '' Mr. Speaker, that is a question we have to wrestle with. Are our kids heading for another Beirut? I hope not, Mr. Speaker, and while I would like to think that this Congress would have the same ability that the Bundestag is going to have, that the other parliaments, like Italy, are going to have in approving of sending in of their troops, we are not going to have that because our President said our troops are going with or without the support of this Congress and with or without the support of the American people. But, Mr. Speaker, I can assure you of one thing. He may send the troops, but we will make sure that we do not have a repeat of the debacle that occurred in Somalia because our kids are not going to be shortchanged, there is not going to be some political decision determining what we will or will not send once they are over there. If the commitment is made and the troops are sent, then they are going to get every bit of support that this body and our committees in Congress can muster to make sure that our troops are protected. Mr. Speaker, I would ask our colleagues to consider what is about to confront us both this week and next week if, in fact, we have a vote. I am considering legislation right now that I may offer as an amendment if, in fact, we have an up-or-down vote on Bosnia, but again I would close by saying the vote is not really going to matter, Mr. Speaker, because the dice have already been rolled, and the President has already made up his mind, the troops have already been committed, and those of us who have concerns are not isolationists, we are not people who are immoral, and we are not people who think that there is not a proper role for America to help provide security throughout the world. We just question the way that we got to where we are and the decision of this President to put 20,000 kids in harm's way between these warring factions that have been at each other's throats not for 4 years, and not for one decade, but decade after decade and century after century.

Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Weldon] is recognized for 60 minutes. Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to discuss an issue that is going to confront us for the next several weeks in regard to the President's intention to send 20,000 to 25,000 of America's sons and daughters to the Balkans to participate in living up to the terms of the agreement just recently initialed in Dayton, OH. Mr. Speaker, like many Americans across the country, I sat before my television set last evening and listened intently as President Clinton gave his justification to the American people for sending ground troops into Bosnia. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks from tomorrow I was invited to the Pentagon, where I had breakfast with Secretary Perry and the leadership of the Joint Chiefs, including General Shalikashvili, where they made a personal case to me and other Members of the Committee on National Security as to why we should commit our troops to Bosnia in light of the pending peace agreement, which had not yet been initialed. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to respond, first of all, to President Clinton's speech, because parts of it bothered me greatly, and to lay the foundation for a hearing which our committee will hold on Thursday when again Secretary Perry, General Shalikashvili, and Secretary Christopher will come before the House Committee on National Security and again make the case to us to support the President's efforts. Mr. Speaker, as someone who has been on the Committee on National Security for 9 years and who chairs the Research and Development Subcommittee, I am vitally interested in any place or any time that we send our troops into harm's way, whether it be the time that we sent them to Desert Storm, or Haiti, or other operations around the world. Mr. Speaker, I was taken aback by some of the comments President Clinton made in the speech yesterday evening and I have to respond to them, and this is the only opportunity where I can deal with them in a lengthy and involved format. I want to respond to three specific points that the President made to the American people and to Members of this body. I want to, first of all, respond to his assertion that those who disagree with him are isolationists and want us to come back into our own borders and not be a part of the world community. The second issue I want to take exception to is the way that he characterized the moral argument involved in getting involved in Bosnia. And the third is the President's comparison of Bosnia and our potential involvement there to Haiti and Somalia as well as Desert Storm. Then I want to get into my own specific concerns relative to a potential vote that we may take in this body a week or two from now. First of all, Mr. Speaker, let me respond to the contention made by President Clinton that those who may oppose his policy here are isolationists. Mr. Speaker, the fact is that for the past 3 years, a strong bipartisan voice in this body and the other body have voted repeatedly, have signed letters, have sent messages to the White House and the administration that we want to be a part of the process of helping achieve peace in the Balkans. And, in fact, Mr. Speaker, I, like many of my colleagues in this body today, would support the presence of the United States in a somewhat limited way in the Balkans, as we have done repeatedly over the last 3 years. After all, Mr. Speaker, there were many Members of both the majority and minority parties that supported the President's use of our Air Force in terms of the air strikes. Many of us have supported logistical support to provide food and clothing and humanitarian support and relief to the people of the Balkans. So time and again over the past 3 years Members of this body and the other body have made it clear that we want to be involved. And, in fact, Mr. Speaker, as I said to the Secretary of Defense 2- weeks ago, I am prepared to support American troops in Bosnia tomorrow, but not on the ground. And, Mr. Speaker, that is the key issue that President Clinton completely ignored last evening. He made it appear as if we are in disagreement with him on his policy; that, therefore, we must not want the United States to be involved at all, and that is absolutely totally wrong. I think it was really shortsighted of the President to make that statement to the American people. In fact, what I proposed to Secretary Perry, I think, would be supported by many of our colleagues in this body; and that is, why should America have to put 20,000 to 25,000 ground troops in between three warring factions that have been at war not for 4 years and not for one decade but for decades and decades and centuries and centuries? Why should the European countries, who are the bordering nations to Bosnia, not step up with that ground support force and let the United States involvement be what we do very well; airlift, sealift, air strikes, command and control, intelligence gathering and monitoring, and all the other ancillary support to make this mission a success? In fact, Mr. Speaker, when the President talks about a U.S. commitment of 20,000 to 25,000 troops, he is not being realistic with the American people nor is he being realistic with our colleagues in this body. As a matter of fact, right now, Mr. Speaker, we have an estimated 15,000 troops who are providing support services in the theater around Bosnia. These services range from airlift and sealift to intelligence gathering, to all kinds of functions that they have been assigned by the Pentagon, just to name a few of the assignments that our military is currently involved in in the European theater, and this is, by the way, not complete. We have Operation Able Sentry going on right now. We have Operation Deny Flight. We have Operation Provide Province, Operation Sharp Guard, and Operation Provide Comfort. All of those operations are, today, involving American troops in the theater that the President is talking about sending ground troops in. In fact, along with the ground troops that President Clinton is proposing, we are going to have a carrier, the America, off the coast. We are going to have Navy pilots and Navy personnel available. So our total support forces, besides the 20,000 to 25,000 ground troops, is going to be somewhere between 13,000 and 17,000. When I met with the Secretary 2 weeks ago, I tried to pin he and General Shalikashvili to a specific number, and I will do that again this Thursday. I asked them, how many other U.S. troops will be involved in this effort? They would not give me a specific answer. To the best of my ability, I have determined that number will be somewhere above 15,000. So when the President goes before the American people as he did last night and says, I want to send 20,000 troops in, that is our commitment, what he should have said is, I want to have 35,000 or perhaps 40,000 U.S. troops involved in the theater of operation that includes, as our overall mission, Bosnia and the maintaining of the peace agreement that was initiated in Dayton. Now, many of us in this body feel that what the President should have done is said we will provide that support in the form of airlift and sealift and use of our aircraft for attacks, if necessary, on selected sites, and command and control and intelligence gathering, but should not have had American troops placed in harm's way in an area of the world so far away from our shore and which many of us feel that we do not have a direct national interest. Many of us feel that it [[Page H 13726]] is unconscionable that those countries that directly surround the Balkans are only putting in small tokens of troops. Now, Mr. Speaker, we have not been able to get exact counts. These numbers have varied. But I went through the foreign media, through our FBIS reports we get, that we can request in our offices, to try to get a feel for what other countries are committing in the way of troops to this operation. I think it is important for our colleagues and for the American public to understand exactly what those commitments are and what, if any, strings are being attached, so that, when the President speaks about 25 nations being involved, we know really what he means and what these countries are actually saying. Great Britain, the United Kingdom, always our staunch ally, is in fact going to put up the largest complement of troops besides the United States. The Most recent number we have is about 13,000 troops compared to our 20,000. Now, Great Britain is very close to the Balkans, certainly much closer than the United States, and is obviously a part of the European theater. So you would expect them to put in place a large presence of military forces. Let us go to Germany. Here I have a problem, Mr. Speaker. The United States and the President are committing 20,000 ground troops and the ancillary support troops that I have just talked about numbering at least 15,000. The Germans have said that, and get this, Mr. Speaker, subject to the Bundestag's approval. In other words, we do not have to approve what the President wants to do in our Congress. He can send the troops on his own, which he said he would do with or without our vote of approval. But in Germany their commitment to send their troops will be predicated upon the support of the Bundestag. And how many troops are the Germans going to send in? Not 13,000, not 10,000, not 5,000, but 4,000. So Germany, right next to the Balkans, is going to send a total of 4,000 troops to the Balkans as their part of this operation. Now, quoting the minister in a German publication, the defense minister, who spoke on November 22, he went on to say that these 4,000 troops would be involved, and I quote, in terms of being logistical units, engineers, medical orderlies, transport units, helicopters, and aircraft to secure the airspace. Where is the commitment for the ground troops in the middle of the hostile parties? This is Germany's commitment. Then we go on to France. I remind our colleagues, Mr. Speaker, that France has a very real threat from the spread of the Bosnian operation, and France is very near and close to the proximity of the Balkan conflict and you would expect would be willing to put up a sizable amount of soldiers for this operation. France's commitment is currently listed in a most recent French publication of November 22 as 7,500 soldiers. This would be a part of the overall NATO deployment, but 7,500 soldiers. This is the same France that is only putting up 7,500 soldiers to our 20,000 that denied the United States the ability to fly our planes over France when we were going after Mu'ammar Qadhafi when Ronald Reagan was the President, in response to attacks he had made on American citizens. So France's commitment right now is listed at 7,500. Let us go to Spain, another European country. Let us see what Spain is talking about committing. This is from a radio network in Spanish in Madrid. Mr. Suarez Pertierra said it would be a tactical group of some 1,250 soldiers. So, while America is putting in 20,000 to 25,000 ground troops, Spain in talking about sending 1,250 soldiers to this operation. Let us look at Sweden. Sweden, another European country that obviously has an interest in seeing peace in that part of the world, has said that it will be part of a Nordic brigade that would have 900 Swedes. Now, Sweden also has a condition placed on its commitment. {time} 2300 And that condition is that the United Nations shall be financially responsible for this operation. So, Sweden is saying, ``Yes, we will go, but you pay our bill.'' I did not hear that said on the part of our commitment. We are going to pay the entire bill. Mr. Speaker, my guess is that this will end up much like Haiti. We not only paid for our expenses, but we will end up paying for the housing costs, the feeding, and logistical support for a number of other countries, all of which will be borne by the American taxpayers. But Sweden's troop commitment is right now 900. Then we go to Austria, and I will quote a news source from Vienna Television Network, November 21, where there is a quotation from the leadership of Austria about their commitment. Their consideration is for sending a force of 200 to 250 men. It goes on to say, quote, ``Volunteers, of course. No one is going to be forced to go into this.'' Mr. Speaker, 200 to 250 are going to be volunteers and they will not serve as combat troops. They will be there as a transport unit. Let us go on and talk about Italy, another European country that is expected to be a part of this operation. Look at what Italy's contribution will be. Initially, Italy balked when the press said that they heard rumors that 2,100 men would be sent, but now there is confirmation that the form will be 2,100. But Italian news media sources also go on to say that actually, and I quote, ``Parliament still has to give its approval to send out Italian troops.'' So, the United States Congress will not have the ability to approve the President's sending of not 20,000, but perhaps 35,000 troops into that theater; we will have the German Bundestag approve the German troops going in, and the Italian Parliament approve the Italian troops going in, but we will not have that ability in this country. The total commitment of Italy will be 2,100 men. The Netherlands, another European country. The Netherlands, according to its population, is perhaps contributing a larger element that we would expect. The Netherlands Cabinet wants to make a decision about sending 2,000 troops to help with the peace accord. Then we have Denmark. A Danish battalion is set to leave on January 8 as part of the NATO operation and they are talking about 807 men going from Denmark. Mr. Speaker, these are not my reports. These are all sources that I will provide to anyone in this body in terms of what our European allies in NATO are going to commit to this operation. Our point, Mr. Speaker, is not one of isolation. We want to be the leader of NATO, and we know we are. We continue to help our NATO allies every day. We have a strong presence in the European countries I have just mentioned. We have military bases there and Navy units deployed in the vicinity of those countries. We will be there for them. But, Mr. Speaker, Bosnia is largely a European problem and many of us in this body feel that while the United States must play a role, and that role can be air strikes, air support, sea life support, command and control, intelligence gatherings, and all the other logistical help that we should not have to go beyond that and put 20,000 young American sons and daughters in the middle of what could be a very hostile environment; what certainly has been a very hostile environment. So when the President talks, as he did last night, about isolationism, the President is totally, absolutely wrong. It is a slap in the face to every Member of this body that he would say his opponents are isolationists. In fact, many of us have said all along that we want us to be involved; we just do not want the United States to go it alone. That is what we think this President has gotten us into. My opinion is the President, to some extent, put his foot in his mouth earlier their year when he said to the NATO allied leaders, ``I will put ground troops in Bosnia if we get a peace agreement.'' What he should have said is, ``I will make a commitment,'' and left that up to the final negotiations in Dayton. He did not do that. Mr. Speaker, while the negotiations were going on, all of us in this body knew what was going to come out of those negotiations, and that was going to be taking the President up on his word, and that is to send 20,000 ground troops into Bosnia. That should never have been the negotiating position of this country in terms of our NATO involvement. [[Page H 13727]] It certainly is not the position of this Member, and I know many of my colleagues, that we should not be involved, nor should we be isolationists. The second issue I want to take up with the President is the way he characterized the morality argument here. He somehow tries to make the case that the Members of Congress who perhaps question what he wants to do here are not concerned about babies being killed, about ethnic cleaning, and about women being raped. Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. As a member of the Human Rights Caucus since I have been in this body, I have tirelessly, again and again, spoken out on behalf of human rights abuses. In fact, Mr. Speaker, in at least three votes in this body over the past 2 years, we have overwhelmingly told the President to lift the arms embargo so that the Bosnian people could defend themselves, so that they, in fact, could have a level playing field, so that we could stop the abuses and stop the ethnic cleaning and stop the rape and torturing. Every time this Congress, in a strong bipartisan manner, told the President to lift the embargo, the President said, ``no.'' Yet last night on national TV, the President tells the American people that he is really that one concerned about these kids being killed and these women being raped and the ethic cleaning. Well, Mr. Speaker, what were we doing the past 2 or 3 years with all of these votes and these letters and these issues where we came forward and said, ``You have got to do something, Mr. President, about what is happening in the Balkans,'' and he did nothing. Now, all of a sudden the solution to all of these problems is to spend 20,000 of our kids into the Balkans on the ground in the middle of this controversy. Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely no justification for the President to make the statement that he made last night that he is the only one concerned with the moral issue of why we should be involved. There are steps that we could have and should have taken over the last 2 years to help even the playing field in the Balkans and we did not do it. Not because the Congress would not act, but because the President would not listen. These were not just Republicans speaking. These were Republicans and Democrats. Some of the most eloquent leaders on lifting the arms sanctions and the arms embargo were on the minority side of the aisle; not just on the Republican side. What really bothered me about the speech that the President made last night, at the end, Mr. Speaker, was when he alluded to a conversation that he had with the Pope. I really though it was grasping for straws when President Clinton basically said, The Pope told me to do it. Mr. Speaker, I have the highest respect for the Vatican and for the Holy Father and for the leadership he provides for the world's Catholics. But, Mr. Speaker, to use a comment that supposedly have been attributed to the Pope as the political justification boggles my mind. As one of our colleagues on the House floor said today, perhaps the President will tell us that he is going to change his stand on abortion, because I am sure the Holy Father talked to him about the sanctity of life, but I do not see President Clinton following the advice of the Pope on that issue, yet quoting the Pope in terms of taking this action in the Balkans. The third issue I want to take exception with the President last night, Mr. Speaker, deals with his trying to compare the Balkans to what happened in Desert Storm and what happened in Haiti and Somalia. First of all, Mr. Speaker, there are few, if any, similarities. In Desert Storm we have a figure who was destined to take over a major part of the world and threaten the security of not just one country but a freedom-loving people in the Middle East, including the State of Israel, and threatening to create anarchy in that part of the world. President Bush went to great lengths to line up allied support. Mr. Speaker, remember, that the cost of Desert Storm was not just in American lives and dollars, because as every Member, every one of our colleagues knows, the entire cost of Desert Storm, over $52 billion, was borne by those nations that benefited from our involvement. It was not a case where the United States went over and paid the bill and enticed people to come in by saying, ``We will pay your soldiers and provide them food and give them shelter, just be a part of the team.'' Mr. Speaker, in Desert Storm the parties who benefited most provided the dollars. And, yes, we did have an interest and, yes, we responded. And, yes, President Bush came to this Congress and asked for us to have an up-or-down vote in both bodies. I might add, Mr. Speaker, not one Member of the Democratic leadership at that time stood up and spoke for nor voted for the effort to send our troops into Desert Storm. Not one. Yet I am sure when we have a debate on this floor, every one of those Members will get up and support President Clinton's actions. There is irony in that statement. The President compared it to Haiti. Mr. Speaker, Haiti is not turning out to be the success that he promised. What has happened is we have spent about $2 billion of the U.S. taxpayers' dollars, and while the President has boasted about the other countries being involved, when he fails to tell the American people is that we paid for the bulk of their housing, their food, and their allowance support, subsistence support, to come to Haiti to be a part of that operation. {time} 2310 So basically they were brought in because America agreed to foot the bill. The U.S. taxpayers agreed to foot the bill. And whether or not we have been successful in Haiti is still undetermined. There have been killings and assassinations down there on a regular basis. And many of us predict Haiti will go right back to the way it was once we have our presence totally removed from that country. Let us talk about Somalia, because perhaps here is what scares me the most, Mr. Speaker. Somalia is probably that area where we have been involved militarily that I think causes certainly me and many of our colleagues to feel most uncertain and concerned about what President Clinton wants to do in Bosnia. I remember well, Mr. Speaker, a meeting in mid-September, held in one of the largest meeting rooms in the basement of this building, when Secretary of Defense Aspin and Secretary Warren Christopher came into a meeting room filled with Members of Congress only. There were about 300 House and Senate Members there, after we had lost 18 young Americans who had been shot down over Mogadishu and had their bodies dragged through the streets because we did not have the backup troop support to go in and rescue them. When Les Aspin was asked why this happened, he eventually acknowledged that the commanding officer of the Somalian operation had in August requested additional backup support for our troops in that theater but that he and the administration denied that support. When asked why, Secretary Aspin said it was because of the hostile political environment inside the beltway, the first time since Vietnam that a political armchair decision in Washington affected military action in another part of the world. Mr. Speaker, I can guarantee you this, as a member of the Committee on National Security, President Clinton is not going to repeat what he did in Somalia. If he, in fact, is successful in sending 20,000 ground troops into Bosnia, which I am certain he will be, whether or not we have a vote, he has already said he is sending the troops in, we are going to be very careful and we are going to be strident that this President is not going to call the political shots of what our military officers do in that theater. Because if our troops are committed by this Commander in Chief, then those calls have to be made by the commanding officer in charge of the theater of operation in Europe. Commander Joulwon who has the highest respect of most every Member of this body who knows him and the military leadership who serves under him should and will be making those calls. And the one thing that we will be focusing on, since we will probably not be able to stop the President from asserting troops in Bosnia, will be to make sure that General Joulwon gets [[Page H 13728]] every bit of support that he needs to maintain the safety of our troops. We want to make sure that there is no second guessing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, as there was in Somalia, saying, General Joulwon, we cannot send in more troops, we cannot send you more equipment because it is not the right political climate in Washington. If this President follows through on his commitment to send 20,000 ground troops into Bosnia, then this President better be prepared to let General Joulwon call the shots in terms of what support he needs to protect our troops, even though many of us in this body, including myself, have great hesitation with any ground troops going into Bosnia whatsoever. Mr. Speaker, as I said a moment ago, most of us have resigned ourselves to the fact that we cannot stop the troops from being sent over there. The President is in fact the Commander in chief of our military. I acknowledge that. He has that function. He has the ability to commit our troops to any part of the world, even though twice in my lifetime, it has been this Congress, under Democrats, who have cut off funding for our military as a way to bring our troops back home from Vietnam and from Somalia. So this President will in fact send our troops. Whether we have a vote or not here will not matter. He has already ignored the will of the Congress in terms of lifting the arms embargo over the past 2 years, and he has already ignored the will of the Congress three times in the last 2 months. Because three times since August, Mr. Speaker, this body and the other body have taken specific votes to say to the President, do not commit ground troops. Aerial support, logistical support, other types of aerial attacks and other types of support that we can provide, okay, but do not commit ground troops. And those votes were overwhelmingly bipartisan. They were not Republicans. There were Democrats and Republicans together. What did President Clinton do? For the past 3 months he has ignored those votes. Even last week, the week before, before the agreement was initialed in Dayton, OH, this body again went on record saying, Mr. President, do not commit ground troops. He is going to send ground troops whether we have another vote or not. But what we will do in this body is, we will make sure that we do not have a repeat of the Clinton Somalia debacle where American kids who were sent to a foreign country are allowed to be put at risk and, in the case of Somalia, 18 of them coming home in body bags after their bodies were dragged through the streets of downtown Mogadishu. With every ounce of energy in my body, Mr. Speaker, that is not going to happen this time. The President may have his way in sending the troops in, but we who are on the Committee on National Security and those of us in the bipartisan manner in this Congress will work to make sure that our troops are given every possible means of support that they need with no second-guessing coming from the bureaucracy inside the Beltway here, letting our military leadership that has been assigned to this operation, in this case General Joulwon, make those decisions and have the full support he needs. Mr. Speaker, there are many other articles that I want to put in the Record and will do so either tonight or in special orders I will be taking out this week from news sources around the world where those people inside of the Balkans are questioning this agreement. We have to be aware of what the leadership in those countries are saying, not just what the three signatories to that agreement out in Dayton said, because they are three individuals. The question is, do they in fact represent the majority of the people in the Balkans? Are the people going to adhere? Are they going to cooperate with this peacekeeping force? If you read some of the FBIS articles that have come out over the past several days, I have grave concerns. Mr. Speaker, I would ask to enter into the Record an article that was printed in the Belgrade Nasa Borba in Serbo-Croatian, its November 22 edition, relative to the political parties and the peace accord and statements specifically that Serbian Radical Party President Vojislav Seselj exclaimed, and I quote, ``The biggest betrayal of the Serbian nation has just been committed.'' In stark opposition to the prevailing positive reactions to the agreement, Serbian Radical Party President Vojislav Seselj, according to BETA, exclaimed that ``the biggest betrayal of the Serbian nation has just been committed.'' I ask to include in the Record articles, again from FBIS reports, quoting a leading Bosnian Serb official Momcilo Krajisnik in terms of his refusal to sign on to the accord and explaining his opposition and how this agreement is a sellout of the Serbs. [FBIS Transcribed Text, Nov. 21, 1995] Plan ``Not Accepted'' by Serbs Sarajevo (AFP).--A senior Bosnian Serb official warned late Tuesday [21 November] that the peace accord agreed in Dayton, Ohio does not satisfy ``even a minimum'' of their demands. Quoted by the Bosnian Serb official media, ``parliamentary speaker'' Momcilo Krajisnik said: ``The agreement that has been reached does not satisfy even a minimum of our interests. Our delegation has not accepted the plan and we were unanimous on that.'' I also ask to include articles, again from the FBIS reports, from the Banja Luka Srpska Televizija, a TV station in Banja Luka, relative to the explanation of the accord and saying that, ``The people, the Serbs are not intimidated by the Dayton agreement, they are not intimidated by the Dayton agreement in terms of what it is going to do to their nation.'' Further go on to quote in the same article, we will never give up Sarajevo, dead or alive, let everyone know that. If I were able to talk to both Clinton and Christopher like our delegation that went to negotiate, I would tell them not to play with the Serbs. It goes on to further say, there is no Serb who would leave this and leave the Serb land behind. And it further goes on to say, they will not be frightened of the signatures from Dayton, speaking of the Serbs in Bosnia. [FBIS Translated Text, Nov. 23, 1995] Serbs in Sarajevo Await ``Explanation'' of Accord (Report by Draga Grubic) The signing of the Dayton peace agreement has recently engrossed the citizens of Serb Sarajevo as the event on which they pinned their hope and survival. Now that the results of the talks have been revealed, the people of Sarajevo expect official explanation of the agreement that is to determine their destiny as well as the future of the second largest Serb town in former Yugoslavia. Neither the joint Croat- Muslim enemy, NATO jets, nor rapid reaction mortars managed to send the locals into exile and they are not intimidated by the Dayton agreement either. ____ [FBIS Translated Text, Nov. 23, 1995] Excerpt From ``Sarajevo Serbs Oppose Dayton Peace Plan'' [Unidentified woman] What, to give them Sarajevo?

(Report by Angus MacKinnon) Brussels, Nov. 27 (AFP).--NATO on Monday [27 November] warned Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic that any attempt to intimidate the peace force the alliance plans to send to Bosnia would be greeted with an ``extremely robust'' response. Finally, Mr. Speaker, another editorial, written by Bela Jodal, ``Compulsory Hope,'' in a Budapest publication. This is a very important question he asks. ``Will it be the U.S. troops who left Somalia due to difficulties which were smaller than what can be expected in the Balkans?'' [FBIS Translated Text, Nov. 23, 1995] Editorial Doubts Future of Bosnian Peace Accord * * * * * Will it be the U.S. troops who left Somalia due to difficulties which were much smaller than what can be expected in the Balkans? Mr. Speaker, the key question we have to ask is, is what we are about to [[Page H 13729]] do and what this President is about to do in America's best interest? More importantly, Mr. Speaker, we, as elected Representatives of approximately 600,000 people each across this country, have to be able to ask ourselves the ultimate question: Can we go into that family's home when their son or daughter or mother or father or brother or sister are sent home as a casualty of this conflict and be able to justify the job and the mission that they did? {time} 2320 I am a strong supporter of our military, Mr. Speaker, and proudly so, and I will be a strong supporter if the President deploys them there. But I do not support the President's policy, and I do not believe he has made the case. Let me say in closing, Mr. Speaker, in coming to my conclusions 2 weeks ago I had to rely on a friend of mine who has been in Sarajevo for 3 years. His name is John Jordan. He is a Rhode Island volunteer firefighter. He went over to Sarajevo because he heard that the fire and emergency services personnel were being abused by the military even though they were trying to serve the Croats, Serbs, Muslems, all factions. He went over to volunteer to help them. He ended up staying 3 years. Mr. Speaker, he was featured by ABC-TV as their person of the week for the work that he did as a volunteer. He brought 50 other Americans over with him to help the Serbian fire brigade with Keenan Slimmick, who was the fire chief before he was assassinated. John Jordan was shot twice while he was in Sarajevo. He was beaten in the chest with the blunt end of a rifle. He had concussions, shrapnel wounds, but stayed there helping all of the various people in Sarajevo get decent medical protection and protection from fires and disasters. We sent an airlift of supplies over to him a year and a half ago., We sent three or four fire trucks, rescue equipment that had been donated from around the country, to help him perform this mission in Sarajevo of humanitarian aid to these people during the time this President did nothing to satisfy those concerns he spoke of last night. I asked John Jordan to come down to Washington to tell me what he thought we should do. John Jordan, American citizen, after 3 years in Sarajevo, gave me the following quote, Mr. Speaker, which appeared in an AP wire story on October 22 in regard to what we are going to face in Bosnia. Every one of us in this body have to understand in a context of the quotes I have given what John Jordan said will occur there: ``We're going to face some very, very ugly, heavily armed, prone-to- violence people who are totally unafraid of the United States,'' he said. ``I've had more than one Serb commander say to me, `I really wish the U.S. instead of the French were running the airport. If we can just get enough of you in one place at one time, we can kill 200 or 300 of you, you'll be out of this war forever, and you won't be a problem anymore. You'll leave just like you left Beirut.' '' Mr. Speaker, that is a question we have to wrestle with. Are our kids heading for another Beirut? I hope not, Mr. Speaker, and while I would like to think that this Congress would have the same ability that the Bundestag is going to have, that the other parliaments, like Italy, are going to have in approving of sending in of their troops, we are not going to have that because our President said our troops are going with or without the support of this Congress and with or without the support of the American people. But, Mr. Speaker, I can assure you of one thing. He may send the troops, but we will make sure that we do not have a repeat of the debacle that occurred in Somalia because our kids are not going to be shortchanged, there is not going to be some political decision determining what we will or will not send once they are over there. If the commitment is made and the troops are sent, then they are going to get every bit of support that this body and our committees in Congress can muster to make sure that our troops are protected. Mr. Speaker, I would ask our colleagues to consider what is about to confront us both this week and next week if, in fact, we have a vote. I am considering legislation right now that I may offer as an amendment if, in fact, we have an up-or-down vote on Bosnia, but again I would close by saying the vote is not really going to matter, Mr. Speaker, because the dice have already been rolled, and the President has already made up his mind, the troops have already been committed, and those of us who have concerns are not isolationists, we are not people who are immoral, and we are not people who think that there is not a proper role for America to help provide security throughout the world. We just question the way that we got to where we are and the decision of this President to put 20,000 kids in harm's way between these warring factions that have been at each other's throats not for 4 years, and not for one decade, but decade after decade and century after century. ","['The SPEAKER ', 'pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Weldon] is recognized for 60 minutes. ', 'Mr. WELDON ', 'of Pennsylvania. Mr. ', 'Speaker, I ', ""rise this evening to discuss an issue that is going to confront us for the next several weeks in regard to the President's intention to send 20,000 to 25,000 of America's sons and daughters to the Balkans to participate in living up to the terms of the agreement just recently initialed in "", 'Dayton, OH.', ' Mr. Speaker, like many Americans across the country, I sat before my television set last evening and listened intently as President Clinton gave his justification to the American people for sending ground troops into Bosnia. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks from tomorrow I was invited to the Pentagon, where I had breakfast with Secretary Perry and the leadership of the Joint Chiefs, including General Shalikashvili, where they made a personal case to me and other Members of the Committee on National Security as to why we should commit our troops to Bosnia in light of the pending peace agreement, which had not yet been initialed. Mr. ', 'Speaker, I ', ""rise tonight to respond, first of all, to President Clinton's speech, because parts of it bothered me greatly, and to lay the foundation for a hearing which our committee will hold on Thursday when again Secretary Perry, General Shalikashvili, and Secretary Christopher will come before the House Committee on National Security and again make the case to us to support the President's efforts. Mr. Speaker, as someone who has been on the Committee on National Security for 9 years and who chairs the Research and Development "", 'Subcommittee, I ', ""am vitally interested in any place or any time that we send our troops into harm's way, whether it be the time that we sent them to Desert Storm, or Haiti, or other operations around the world. Mr. "", 'Speaker, I ', ""was taken aback by some of the comments President Clinton made in the speech yesterday evening and I have to respond to them, and this is the only opportunity where I can deal with them in a lengthy and involved format. I want to respond to three specific points that the President made to the American people and to Members of this body. I want to, first of all, respond to his assertion that those who disagree with him are isolationists and want us to come back into our own borders and not be a part of the world community. The second issue I want to take exception to is the way that he characterized the moral argument involved in getting involved in Bosnia. And the third is the President's comparison of Bosnia and our potential involvement there to Haiti and Somalia as well as Desert Storm. "", 'Then I ', 'want to get into my own specific concerns relative to a potential vote that we may take in this body a week or two from now. First of all, Mr. Speaker, let me respond to the contention made by President Clinton that those who may oppose his policy here are isolationists. Mr. Speaker, the fact is that for the past 3 years, a strong bipartisan voice in this body and the other body have voted repeatedly, have signed letters, have sent messages to the White House and the administration that we want to be a part of the process of helping achieve peace in the Balkans. And, in fact, Mr. ', 'Speaker, I,', "" like many of my colleagues in this body today, would support the presence of the United States in a somewhat limited way in the Balkans, as we have done repeatedly over the last 3 years. After all, Mr. Speaker, there were many Members of both the majority and minority parties that supported the President's use of our Air Force in terms of the air strikes. Many of us have supported logistical support to provide food and clothing and humanitarian support and relief to the people of the Balkans. So time and again over the past 3 years Members of this body and the other body have made it clear that we want to be involved. And, in fact, Mr. Speaker, as I said to the Secretary of Defense 2- weeks ago, I am prepared to support American troops in Bosnia tomorrow, but not on the ground. And, Mr. Speaker, that is the key issue that President Clinton completely ignored last evening. He made it appear as if we are in disagreement with him on his policy; that, therefore, we must not want the United States to be involved at all, and that is absolutely totally wrong. I think it was really shortsighted of the President to make that statement to the American people. In fact, what I proposed to Secretary "", 'Perry, I ', 'think, would be supported by many of our colleagues in this body; and that is, why should America have to put 20,000 to 25,000 ground troops in between three warring factions that have been at war not for 4 years and not for one decade but for decades and decades and centuries and centuries? Why should the European countries, who are the bordering nations to Bosnia, not step up with that ground support force and let the United States involvement be what we do very well; airlift, sealift, air strikes, command and control, intelligence gathering and monitoring, and all the other ancillary support to make this mission a success? In fact, Mr. Speaker, when the President talks about a U.S. commitment of 20,000 to 25,000 troops, he is not being realistic with the American people nor is he being realistic with our colleagues in this body. As a matter of fact, right now, Mr. Speaker, we have an estimated 15,000 troops who are providing support services in the theater around Bosnia. These services range from airlift and sealift to intelligence gathering, to all kinds of functions that they have been assigned by the Pentagon, just to name a few of the assignments that our military is currently involved in in the European theater, and this is, by the way, not complete. We have Operation Able Sentry going on right now. We have Operation Deny Flight. We have Operation Provide Province, Operation Sharp Guard, and Operation Provide Comfort. All of those operations are, today, involving American troops in the theater that the President is talking about sending ground troops in. In fact, along with the ground troops that President Clinton is proposing, we are going to have a carrier, the America, off the coast. We are going to have Navy pilots and Navy personnel available. So our total support forces, besides the 20,000 to 25,000 ground troops, is going to be somewhere between 13,000 and 17,000. ', 'When I ', 'met with the Secretary 2 weeks ago, I tried to pin he and General Shalikashvili to a specific number, and I will do that again this ', 'Thursday. I ', ""asked them, how many other U.S. troops will be involved in this effort? They would not give me a specific answer. To the best of my ability, I have determined that number will be somewhere above 15,000. So when the President goes before the American people as he did last night and says, I want to send 20,000 troops in, that is our commitment, what he should have said is, I want to have 35,000 or perhaps 40,000 U.S. troops involved in the theater of operation that includes, as our overall mission, Bosnia and the maintaining of the peace agreement that was initiated in Dayton. Now, many of us in this body feel that what the President should have done is said we will provide that support in the form of airlift and sealift and use of our aircraft for attacks, if necessary, on selected sites, and command and control and intelligence gathering, but should not have had American troops placed in harm's way in an area of the world so far away from our shore and which many of us feel that we do not have a direct national interest. Many of us feel that it [["", 'Page H ', '13726]] is unconscionable that those countries that directly surround the Balkans are only putting in small tokens of troops. Now, Mr. Speaker, we have not been able to get exact counts. These numbers have varied. ', 'But I ', 'went through the foreign media, through our ', 'FBIS ', 'reports we get, that we can request in our offices, to try to get a feel for what other countries are committing in the way of troops to this operation. I think it is important for our colleagues and for the American public to understand exactly what those commitments are and what, if any, strings are being attached, so that, when the President speaks about 25 nations being involved, we know really what he means and what these countries are actually saying. Great Britain, the United Kingdom, always our staunch ally, is in fact going to put up the largest complement of troops besides the United States. The Most recent number we have is about 13,000 troops compared to our 20,000. Now, Great Britain is very close to the Balkans, certainly much closer than the United States, and is obviously a part of the European theater. So you would expect them to put in place a large presence of military forces. Let us go to Germany. ', 'Here I ', ""have a problem, Mr. Speaker. The United States and the President are committing 20,000 ground troops and the ancillary support troops that I have just talked about numbering at least 15,000. The Germans have said that, and get this, Mr. Speaker, subject to the Bundestag's approval. In other words, we do not have to approve what the President wants to do in our Congress. He can send the troops on his own, which he said he would do with or without our vote of approval. But in Germany their commitment to send their troops will be predicated upon the support of the Bundestag. And how many troops are the Germans going to send in? Not 13,000, not 10,000, not 5,000, but 4,000. So Germany, right next to the Balkans, is going to send a total of 4,000 troops to the Balkans as their part of this operation. Now, quoting the minister in a German publication, the defense minister, who spoke on November 22, he went on to say that these 4,000 troops would be involved, and I quote, in terms of being logistical units, engineers, medical orderlies, transport units, helicopters, and aircraft to secure the airspace. Where is the commitment for the ground troops in the middle of the hostile parties? This is Germany's commitment. Then we go on to "", 'France. I ', ""remind our colleagues, Mr. Speaker, that France has a very real threat from the spread of the Bosnian operation, and France is very near and close to the proximity of the Balkan conflict and you would expect would be willing to put up a sizable amount of soldiers for this operation. France's commitment is currently listed in a most recent French publication of November 22 as 7,500 soldiers. This would be a part of the overall "", 'NATO ', ""deployment, but 7,500 soldiers. This is the same France that is only putting up 7,500 soldiers to our 20,000 that denied the United States the ability to fly our planes over France when we were going after Mu'ammar Qadhafi when Ronald Reagan was the President, in response to attacks he had made on American citizens. So France's commitment right now is listed at 7,500. Let us go to Spain, another European country. Let us see what Spain is talking about committing. This is from a radio network in Spanish in Madrid. Mr. Suarez Pertierra said it would be a tactical group of some 1,250 soldiers. So, while America is putting in 20,000 to 25,000 ground troops, Spain in talking about sending 1,250 soldiers to this operation. Let us look at Sweden. Sweden, another European country that obviously has an interest in seeing peace in that part of the world, has said that it will be part of a Nordic brigade that would have 900 Swedes. Now, Sweden also has a condition placed on its commitment. {time} 2300 And that condition is that the United Nations shall be financially responsible for this operation. So, Sweden is saying, ``Yes, we will go, but you pay our bill.'' I did not hear that said on the part of our commitment. We are going to pay the entire bill. Mr. Speaker, my guess is that this will end up much like Haiti. We not only paid for our expenses, but we will end up paying for the housing costs, the feeding, and logistical support for a number of other countries, all of which will be borne by the American taxpayers. But Sweden's troop commitment is right now 900. Then we go to Austria, and I will quote a news source from Vienna Television Network, November 21, where there is a quotation from the leadership of Austria about their commitment. Their consideration is for sending a force of 200 to 250 men. It goes on to say, quote, ``Volunteers, of course. No one is going to be forced to go into this.'' Mr. Speaker, 200 to 250 are going to be volunteers and they will not serve as combat troops. They will be there as a transport unit. Let us go on and talk about Italy, another European country that is expected to be a part of this operation. Look at what Italy's contribution will be. Initially, Italy balked when the press said that they heard rumors that 2,100 men would be sent, but now there is confirmation that the form will be 2,100. But Italian news media sources also go on to say that actually, and I quote, ``Parliament still has to give its approval to send out Italian troops.'' So, the United States Congress will not have the ability to approve the President's sending of not 20,000, but perhaps 35,000 troops into that theater; we will have the German Bundestag approve the German troops going in, and the Italian Parliament approve the Italian troops going in, but we will not have that ability in this country. The total commitment of Italy will be 2,100 men. The Netherlands, another European country. The Netherlands, according to its population, is perhaps contributing a larger element that we would expect. The Netherlands Cabinet wants to make a decision about sending 2,000 troops to help with the peace accord. Then we have "", 'Denmark. A ', 'Danish battalion is set to leave on January 8 as part of the ', 'NATO ', 'operation and they are talking about 807 men going from Denmark. Mr. Speaker, these are not my reports. These are all sources that I will provide to anyone in this body in terms of what our European allies in ', 'NATO ', 'are going to commit to this operation. Our point, Mr. Speaker, is not one of isolation. We want to be the leader of ', 'NATO,', ' and we know we are. We continue to help our ', 'NATO ', 'allies every day. We have a strong presence in the European countries I have just mentioned. We have military bases there and Navy units deployed in the vicinity of those countries. We will be there for them. But, Mr. Speaker, Bosnia is largely a European problem and many of us in this body feel that while the United States must play a role, and that role can be air strikes, air support, sea life support, command and control, intelligence gatherings, and all the other logistical help that we should not have to go beyond that and put 20,000 young American sons and daughters in the middle of what could be a very hostile environment; what certainly has been a very hostile environment. So when the President talks, as he did last night, about isolationism, the President is totally, absolutely wrong. It is a slap in the face to every Member of this body that he would say his opponents are isolationists. In fact, many of us have said all along that we want us to be involved; we just do not want the United States to go it alone. That is what we think this President has gotten us into. My opinion is the President, to some extent, put his foot in his mouth earlier their year when he said to the ', 'NATO ', ""allied leaders, ``I will put ground troops in Bosnia if we get a peace agreement.'' What he should have said is, ``I will make a commitment,'' and left that up to the final negotiations in Dayton. He did not do that. Mr. Speaker, while the negotiations were going on, all of us in this body knew what was going to come out of those negotiations, and that was going to be taking the President up on his word, and that is to send 20,000 ground troops into Bosnia. That should never have been the negotiating position of this country in terms of our "", 'NATO ', 'involvement. [[', 'Page H ', ""13727]] It certainly is not the position of this Member, and I know many of my colleagues, that we should not be involved, nor should we be isolationists. The second issue I want to take up with the President is the way he characterized the morality argument here. He somehow tries to make the case that the Members of Congress who perhaps question what he wants to do here are not concerned about babies being killed, about ethnic cleaning, and about women being raped. Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. As a member of the Human Rights Caucus since I have been in this body, I have tirelessly, again and again, spoken out on behalf of human rights abuses. In fact, Mr. Speaker, in at least three votes in this body over the past 2 years, we have overwhelmingly told the President to lift the arms embargo so that the Bosnian people could defend themselves, so that they, in fact, could have a level playing field, so that we could stop the abuses and stop the ethnic cleaning and stop the rape and torturing. Every time this Congress, in a strong bipartisan manner, told the President to lift the embargo, the President said, ``no.'' Yet last night on national TV, the President tells the American people that he is really that one concerned about these kids being killed and these women being raped and the ethic cleaning. Well, Mr. Speaker, what were we doing the past 2 or 3 years with all of these votes and these letters and these issues where we came forward and said, ``You have got to do something, Mr. President, about what is happening in the Balkans,'' and he did nothing. Now, all of a sudden the solution to all of these problems is to spend 20,000 of our kids into the Balkans on the ground in the middle of this controversy. Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely no justification for the President to make the statement that he made last night that he is the only one concerned with the moral issue of why we should be involved. There are steps that we could have and should have taken over the last 2 years to help even the playing field in the Balkans and we did not do it. Not because the Congress would not act, but because the President would not listen. These were not just Republicans speaking. These were Republicans and Democrats. Some of the most eloquent leaders on lifting the arms sanctions and the arms embargo were on the minority side of the aisle; not just on the Republican side. What really bothered me about the speech that the President made last night, at the end, Mr. Speaker, was when he alluded to a conversation that he had with the "", 'Pope. I ', 'really though it was grasping for straws when President Clinton basically said, The Pope told me to do it. Mr. ', 'Speaker, I ', ""have the highest respect for the Vatican and for the Holy Father and for the leadership he provides for the world's Catholics. But, Mr. Speaker, to use a comment that supposedly have been attributed to the Pope as the political justification boggles my mind. As one of our colleagues on the House floor said today, perhaps the President will tell us that he is going to change his stand on abortion, because I am sure the Holy Father talked to him about the sanctity of life, but I do not see President Clinton following the advice of the Pope on that issue, yet quoting the Pope in terms of taking this action in the Balkans. The third issue I want to take exception with the President last night, Mr. Speaker, deals with his trying to compare the Balkans to what happened in Desert Storm and what happened in Haiti and Somalia. First of all, Mr. Speaker, there are few, if any, similarities. In Desert Storm we have a figure who was destined to take over a major part of the world and threaten the security of not just one country but a freedom-loving people in the Middle East, including the State of Israel, and threatening to create anarchy in that part of the world. President Bush went to great lengths to line up allied support. Mr. Speaker, remember, that the cost of Desert Storm was not just in American lives and dollars, because as every Member, every one of our colleagues knows, the entire cost of Desert Storm, over $52 billion, was borne by those nations that benefited from our involvement. It was not a case where the United States went over and paid the bill and enticed people to come in by saying, ``We will pay your soldiers and provide them food and give them shelter, just be a part of the team.'' Mr. Speaker, in Desert Storm the parties who benefited most provided the dollars. And, yes, we did have an interest and, yes, we responded. And, yes, President Bush came to this Congress and asked for us to have an up-or-down vote in both bodies. I might add, Mr. Speaker, not one Member of the Democratic leadership at that time stood up and spoke for nor voted for the effort to send our troops into Desert Storm. Not one. "", 'Yet I ', ""am sure when we have a debate on this floor, every one of those Members will get up and support President Clinton's actions. There is irony in that statement. The President compared it to Haiti. Mr. Speaker, Haiti is not turning out to be the success that he promised. What has happened is we have spent about $2 billion of the U.S. taxpayers' dollars, and while the President has boasted about the other countries being involved, when he fails to tell the American people is that we paid for the bulk of their housing, their food, and their allowance support, subsistence support, to come to Haiti to be a part of that operation. {time} 2310 So basically they were brought in because America agreed to foot the bill. "", 'The U.', 'S. taxpayers agreed to foot the bill. And whether or not we have been successful in Haiti is still undetermined. There have been killings and assassinations down there on a regular basis. And many of us predict Haiti will go right back to the way it was once we have our presence totally removed from that country. Let us talk about Somalia, because perhaps here is what scares me the most, Mr. Speaker. Somalia is probably that area where we have been involved militarily that I think causes certainly me and many of our colleagues to feel most uncertain and concerned about what President Clinton wants to do in ', 'Bosnia. I ', 'remember well, Mr. Speaker, a meeting in mid-September, held in one of the largest meeting rooms in the basement of this building, when Secretary of Defense Aspin and Secretary Warren Christopher came into a meeting room filled with Members of Congress only. There were about 300 House and Senate Members there, after we had lost 18 young Americans who had been shot down over Mogadishu and had their bodies dragged through the streets because we did not have the backup troop support to go in and rescue them. When Les Aspin was asked why this happened, he eventually acknowledged that the commanding officer of the Somalian operation had in August requested additional backup support for our troops in that theater but that he and the administration denied that support. When asked why, Secretary Aspin said it was because of the hostile political environment inside the beltway, the first time since Vietnam that a political armchair decision in Washington affected military action in another part of the world. Mr. ', 'Speaker, I ', 'can guarantee you this, as a member of the Committee on National Security, President Clinton is not going to repeat what he did in Somalia. If he, in fact, is successful in sending 20,000 ground troops into Bosnia, which I am certain he will be, whether or not we have a vote, he has already said he is sending the troops in, we are going to be very careful and we are going to be strident that this President is not going to call the political shots of what our military officers do in that theater. Because if our troops are committed by this Commander in Chief, then those calls have to be made by the commanding officer in charge of the theater of operation in Europe. Commander Joulwon who has the highest respect of most every Member of this body who knows him and the military leadership who serves under him should and will be making those calls. And the one thing that we will be focusing on, since we will probably not be able to stop the President from asserting troops in Bosnia, will be to make sure that General Joulwon gets [[', 'Page H ', '13728]] every bit of support that he needs to maintain the safety of our troops. We want to make sure that there is no second guessing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, as there was in Somalia, saying, General Joulwon, we cannot send in more troops, we cannot send you more equipment because it is not the right political climate in Washington. If this President follows through on his commitment to send 20,000 ground troops into Bosnia, then this President better be prepared to let General Joulwon call the shots in terms of what support he needs to protect our troops, even though many of us in this body, including myself, have great hesitation with any ground troops going into Bosnia whatsoever. Mr. Speaker, as I said a moment ago, most of us have resigned ourselves to the fact that we cannot stop the troops from being sent over there. The President is in fact the Commander in chief of our military. I acknowledge that. He has that function. He has the ability to commit our troops to any part of the world, even though twice in my lifetime, it has been this Congress, under Democrats, who have cut off funding for our military as a way to bring our troops back home from Vietnam and from Somalia. So this President will in fact send our troops. Whether we have a vote or not here will not matter. He has already ignored the will of the Congress in terms of lifting the arms embargo over the past 2 years, and he has already ignored the will of the Congress three times in the last 2 months. Because three times since August, Mr. Speaker, this body and the other body have taken specific votes to say to the President, do not commit ground troops. Aerial support, logistical support, other types of aerial attacks and other types of support that we can provide, okay, but do not commit ground troops. And those votes were overwhelmingly bipartisan. They were not Republicans. There were Democrats and Republicans together. What did President Clinton do? For the past 3 months he has ignored those votes. Even last week, the week before, before the agreement was initialed in ', 'Dayton, OH,', ' this body again went on record saying, Mr. President, do not commit ground troops. He is going to send ground troops whether we have another vote or not. But what we will do in this body is, we will make sure that we do not have a repeat of the Clinton Somalia debacle where American kids who were sent to a foreign country are allowed to be put at risk and, in the case of Somalia, 18 of them coming home in body bags after their bodies were dragged through the streets of downtown Mogadishu. With every ounce of energy in my body, Mr. Speaker, that is not going to happen this time. The President may have his way in sending the troops in, but we who are on the Committee on National Security and those of us in the bipartisan manner in this Congress will work to make sure that our troops are given every possible means of support that they need with no second-guessing coming from the bureaucracy inside the Beltway here, letting our military leadership that has been assigned to this operation, in this case General Joulwon, make those decisions and have the full support he needs. Mr. Speaker, there are many other articles that I want to put in the Record and will do so either tonight or in special orders I will be taking out this week from news sources around the world where those people inside of the Balkans are questioning this agreement. We have to be aware of what the leadership in those countries are saying, not just what the three signatories to that agreement out in Dayton said, because they are three individuals. The question is, do they in fact represent the majority of the people in the Balkans? Are the people going to adhere? Are they going to cooperate with this peacekeeping force? If you read some of the ', 'FBIS ', 'articles that have come out over the past several days, I have grave concerns. Mr. ', 'Speaker, I ', ""would ask to enter into the Record an article that was printed in the Belgrade Nasa Borba in Serbo-Croatian, its November 22 edition, relative to the political parties and the peace accord and statements specifically that Serbian Radical Party President Vojislav Seselj exclaimed, and I quote, ``The biggest betrayal of the Serbian nation has just been committed.'' In stark opposition to the prevailing positive reactions to the agreement, Serbian Radical Party President Vojislav Seselj, according to "", 'BETA,', "" exclaimed that ``the biggest betrayal of the Serbian nation has just been committed.'' I ask to include in the Record articles, again from "", 'FBIS ', 'reports, quoting a leading Bosnian Serb official Momcilo Krajisnik in terms of his refusal to sign on to the accord and explaining his opposition and how this agreement is a sellout of the Serbs. [', 'FBIS ', ""Transcribed Text, Nov. 21, 1995] Plan ``Not Accepted'' by Serbs Sarajevo (AFP).--A senior Bosnian Serb official warned late Tuesday [21 November] that the peace accord agreed in Dayton, Ohio does not satisfy ``even a minimum'' of their demands. Quoted by the Bosnian Serb official media, ``parliamentary speaker'' Momcilo Krajisnik said: ``The agreement that has been reached does not satisfy even a minimum of our interests. Our delegation has not accepted the plan and we were unanimous on that.'' I also ask to include articles, again from the "", 'FBIS ', ""reports, from the Banja Luka Srpska Televizija, a TV station in Banja Luka, relative to the explanation of the accord and saying that, ``The people, the Serbs are not intimidated by the Dayton agreement, they are not intimidated by the Dayton agreement in terms of what it is going to do to their nation.'' Further go on to quote in the same article, we will never give up Sarajevo, dead or alive, let everyone know that. "", 'If I ', 'were able to talk to both Clinton and Christopher like our delegation that went to negotiate, I would tell them not to play with the Serbs. It goes on to further say, there is no Serb who would leave this and leave the Serb land behind.

[', 'FBIS ', ""Translated Text, Nov. 23, 1995] Serbs in Sarajevo Await ``Explanation'' of Accord (Report by Draga Grubic) The signing of the Dayton peace agreement has recently engrossed the citizens of Serb Sarajevo as the event on which they pinned their hope and survival.

Finally, Mr. Speaker, another editorial, written by Bela Jodal, ``Compulsory Hope,'' in a Budapest publication. This is a very important question he asks. ``Will it be the U.S. troops who left Somalia due to difficulties which were smaller than what can be expected in the Balkans?'' ["", 'FBIS ', 'Translated Text, Nov. 23, 1995] Editorial Doubts Future of Bosnian Peace Accord * * * * * Will it be the U.S. troops who left Somalia due to difficulties which were much smaller than what can be expected in the Balkans? Mr. Speaker, the key question we have to ask is, is what we are about to [[', 'Page H ', ""13729]] do and what this President is about to do in America's best interest? More importantly, Mr. Speaker, we, as elected Representatives of approximately 600,000 people each across this country, have to be able to ask ourselves the ultimate question: Can we go into that family's home when their son or daughter or mother or father or brother or sister are sent home as a casualty of this conflict and be able to justify the job and the mission that they did? {time} 2320 I am a strong supporter of our military, Mr. Speaker, and proudly so, and I will be a strong supporter if the President deploys them there. "", 'But I ', ""do not support the President's policy, and I do not believe he has made the case. Let me say in closing, Mr. Speaker, in coming to my conclusions 2 weeks ago I had to rely on a friend of mine who has been in Sarajevo for 3 years. His name is John Jordan. He is a Rhode Island volunteer firefighter. He went over to Sarajevo because he heard that the fire and emergency services personnel were being abused by the military even though they were trying to serve the Croats, Serbs, Muslems, all factions. He went over to volunteer to help them. He ended up staying 3 years. Mr. Speaker, he was featured by "", 'ABC-TV ', ""as their person of the week for the work that he did as a volunteer. He brought 50 other Americans over with him to help the Serbian fire brigade with Keenan Slimmick, who was the fire chief before he was assassinated. John Jordan was shot twice while he was in Sarajevo. He was beaten in the chest with the blunt end of a rifle. He had concussions, shrapnel wounds, but stayed there helping all of the various people in Sarajevo get decent medical protection and protection from fires and disasters. We sent an airlift of supplies over to him a year and a half ago., We sent three or four fire trucks, rescue equipment that had been donated from around the country, to help him perform this mission in Sarajevo of humanitarian aid to these people during the time this President did nothing to satisfy those concerns he spoke of last night. I asked John Jordan to come down to Washington to tell me what he thought we should do. John Jordan, American citizen, after 3 years in Sarajevo, gave me the following quote, Mr. Speaker, which appeared in an AP wire story on October 22 in regard to what we are going to face in Bosnia. Every one of us in this body have to understand in a context of the quotes I have given what John Jordan said will occur there: ``We're going to face some very, very ugly, heavily armed, prone-to- violence people who are totally unafraid of the United States,'' he said. ``I've had more than one Serb commander say to me, `I really wish the U.S. instead of the French were running the airport. If we can just get enough of you in one place at one time, we can kill 200 or 300 of you, you'll be out of this war forever, and you won't be a problem anymore. You'll leave just like you left Beirut.' '' Mr. Speaker, that is a question we have to wrestle with. Are our kids heading for another "", 'Beirut? I ', 'hope not, Mr. Speaker, and while I would like to think that this Congress would have the same ability that the Bundestag is going to have, that the other parliaments, like Italy, are going to have in approving of sending in of their troops, we are not going to have that because our President said our troops are going with or without the support of this Congress and with or without the support of the American people. But, Mr. ', 'Speaker, I ', 'can assure you of one thing. He may send the troops, but we will make sure that we do not have a repeat of the debacle that occurred in Somalia because our kids are not going to be shortchanged, there is not going to be some political decision determining what we will or will not send once they are over there. If the commitment is made and the troops are sent, then they are going to get every bit of support that this body and our committees in Congress can muster to make sure that our troops are protected. Mr. ', 'Speaker, I ', ""would ask our colleagues to consider what is about to confront us both this week and next week if, in fact, we have a vote. I am considering legislation right now that I may offer as an amendment if, in fact, we have an up-or-down vote on Bosnia, but again I would close by saying the vote is not really going to matter, Mr. Speaker, because the dice have already been rolled, and the President has already made up his mind, the troops have already been committed, and those of us who have concerns are not isolationists, we are not people who are immoral, and we are not people who think that there is not a proper role for America to help provide security throughout the world. We just question the way that we got to where we are and the decision of this President to put 20,000 kids in harm's way between these warring factions that have been at each other's throats not for 4 years, and not for one decade, but decade after decade and century after century.

To the Congress of the United States: Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that the emergency declared with respect to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), as expanded to address the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the territory that they control within the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, is to continue in effect beyond May 30, 1995. The circumstances that led to the declaration on May 30, 1992, of a national emergency have not been resolved. The Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) continues to support groups seizing and attempting to seize territory in the Republics of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina by force and violence. In addition, on October 25, 1994, I expanded the scope of the national emergency to address the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the territory that they control, including their refusal to accept the proposed territorial settlement of the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The actions and policies of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the territory that they control pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy interests, and the economy of the United States.

22,"BOSNIA Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the facts are out: The New York Times reported last weekend that the Milosevic regime is actively aiding its Bosnian Serb allies--sending military assistance and fuel, SAM-6's, and even paying the salaries of many Bosnian Serb officers. This comes as little surprise to me, since I have been extremely skeptical of Slobodan Milosevic's reincarnation as peacemaker--an image the Clinton administration has actively promoted in a desperate bid to devise a Bosnia policy. Indeed, the recent hostage taking by the Bosnian Serbs, followed by their release as a result of Milosevic's efforts, has called into question the theory of a split between Milosevic and Radovan Karadzic. In my view the issue is not whether or not Milosevic and Karadzic are friends or political rivals, but whether or not their objectives are the same. The real question is, do Milosevic and Karadzic both want a greater Serbia? It seems to me that the answer is yes--and that this charade of good cop, bad cop, has been useful in furthering that objective. Apparently administration sources were aware of this support from Belgrade but continued with the approach of easing sanctions on Serbia. Those of us in the Congress who believed this policy was unwise for a number of reasons--including the fact that it removed leverage on the deteriorating situation in Kosova--were told that lifting sanctions would help bring peace to Bosnia because Milosevic would recognize Bosnia. Mr. President, this report should prompt an immediate review of the administration's approach. Now is not the time to lift or further suspend sanctions on Serbia. The Milosevic regime is clearly supporting Bosnian Serb and Krajina Serb forces--and maybe even orchestrating their actions. In addition, it is continuing to oppress the Albanian majority in Kosova--which is in its 6th year under martial law. Mr. President, I intend to offer an amendment to the foreign aid bill which would amend current Serbian sanctions legislation--originally sponsored by Senator Levin--to include strict criteria for the lifting of United States sanctions on Belgrade. This criteria will include a complete cutoff of military, political, or other material support from Belgrade to the Bosnian Serb and Krajina Serb militants; a restoration of civil rights to all minorities in Serbia; and a restoration of civil and human rights and political autonomy to the 2 million Albanians in Kosova.

25,"TRIBUTE TO RABBI ARTHUR SCHNEIER ______ HON. TOM LANTOS of california in the house of representatives Thursday, October 19, 1995 Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleagues to join me in paying tribute and expressing deep appreciation to a truly outstanding American, my good friend, the courageous and inspirational Rabbi Arthur Schneier. Rabbi Schneier has earned his place among the great leaders in human rights of this century with his tireless efforts on behalf of the world's victims of ultranationalism, religious persecution, ethnic cleansing and intolerance. He has risen above religious differences to establish the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, which has, for 30 years, brought together Roman Catholic, Protestant, Greek Orthodox, Jewish, and Islamic religious and lay leaders to solve the problems that face our globe. As a young man, Rabbi Schneier led a highly successful campaign to recruit young people at a time of religious disaffection in the 1960's to a program at the Park East Synagogue which eventually became a seven-story day school cultural center that continues to attract young people and currently educates 250 children. This effort, begun in 1965, was the beginning of an extraordinary career in religious leadership for Rabbi Schneier. That year, he recruited and led a group of political and religious leaders for an Appeal of Conscience rally protesting religious repression in the Soviet Union. Rabbi Schneier then established the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, which continues to this day to provide effective and increasingly influential leadership on behalf of religious freedom and human rights throughout the world. Just a few weeks ago, Rabbi Schneier met with Pope John Paul II to discuss the problem of radical nationalism around the world and its inevitably negative effects on human rights and religious freedom, particularly the prevalence of anti-semitism and xenophobia in troubled countries. The Appeal of Conscience Foundation and Rabbi Schneier have been involved in a wide range of the world's most intractable problems and most egregious human rights violations. From meeting with Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev to discuss United States-Russian relations to meetings with the Presidents of Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia to discuss a lasting peace in that troubled region, Rabbi Schneier has taken it upon himself to provide inspirational and effective leadership that has won him praise around the world. Mr. Speaker, Rabbi Schneier is an inspiration to all Americans. He has taken his wealth of good will, tenacity and intelligence and brought his message to the forefront of international discussions. He has championed an issue that touches us all--the protection of the most basic human rights and the freedom to practice one's chosen religion. It is with the deepest appreciation and most heartfelt thanks that I invite my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Rabbi Arthur Schneier.

26,"REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR DEBATE AND CONSIDERATION OF THREE MEASURES RELATING TO U.S. TROOP DEPLOYMENTS IN BOSNIA ______ speech of HON. SAM BROWNBACK of kansas in the house of representatives Wednesday, December 13, 1995 Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. Speaker, I continue to oppose President Clinton's plan to deploy 20,000 United States troops to Bosnia. While I want to end the genocide that has plagued the Balkan Peninsula for the last 4 years, the administration's plan for achieving peace in Bosnia is severely flawed, and, I fear, destined to fail. We would not be debating whether the United States should send troops to Bosnia if Presidents Bush and Clinton had not supported the misguided international arms embargo imposed upon Bosnia. If we had lifted the arms embargo several years ago and imposed a no-fly-zone over Bosnia, the outnumbered Bosnian Serb forces would never have achieved military superiority over the Bosnian Government troops. Instead, we prevented the Bosnian Government forces from defending themselves while Serbia armed the Bosnian Serbs. This policy led to more than 200,000 deaths and created more than 2 million refugees. Having suffered the consequences of one bad policy decision, we now face another. However, this time, we are risking not only more Bosnian lives, but American lives as well. The greatest flaw in the administration's current strategy is that peace has not yet been achieved. There will be no peace as long as there are 4,000 or more foreign Moslem fighters in Bosnia. There will be no peace as long as the Bosnia Croats refuse to fully cooperate with the International War Crimes Tribunal. In addition, there will be no peace as long as rank-and-file Bosnina Serbs continue to oppose the peace plan. All sides in this conflict have a considerable amount of work to do before peace can be achieved. Until all of the parties demonstrate their commitment to ending the bloodshed, long-term peace will not be possible, regardless of the number of troops that are used to separate the warring parties. As long as there is no meaningful peace, United States troops deployed in Bosnia will serve as convenient targets for rogue units frustrated by their inability to attack their real enemy. Even though, as Commander in Chief, the President has the constitutional authority to commit United State soldiers to Bosnia, I cannot support a plan that does not minimize the risks to, and maximize the security of, our troops, especially a deployment that is not vital to our national security interest. I fully support every man and woman who has volunteered to serve in our armed services. I have the greatest admiration for these men and women, and they enjoy my unequivocal support, whether they are here or abroad. By deciding to deploy our troops in Bosnia under the current plan for a mission that is not vital to our national security interests, the President has not properly minimized the risks in military duty, and has jeopardized the credibility that our political leaders enjoy with our Armed Forces.

27,"DOD AUTHORIZATION CONFERENCE REPORT ______ HON. VIC FAZIO of california in the house of representatives Wednesday, January 24, 1996 Mr. FAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I rise reluctantly in support of the fiscal year 1996 Defense authorization conference report. I would like to begin by thanking the chairman and the ranking member of the National Security Committee who worked hard to bridge their differences and produce a bill that the President will sign into law. I would like to point out that I voted against this conference report back in December because of the objectionable language governing national missile defense policy and the restrictions on the President's constitutional prerogatives to make foreign policy. My vote against the initial conference report was the first time in my congressional career that I cast a ``no'' vote on a defense bill, be it authorization or appropriations. Moreover, the reservations and the objections to the original conference report by the respected Senator from Georgia, Mr. Nunn, cast serious doubt on the wisdom of enacting such restrictive and potentially harmful language. As President Clinton said it last night, ``since the dawn of the nuclear age, there is not a single Russian missile pointed at the United States and North Korea has frozen its dangerous nuclear weapons program.'' We have accomplished that because both Democratic and Republican administrations have worked tirelessly to ratify the START Treaty which significantly reduced the nuclear stockpile between the former Soviet Union and the United States. And now we are on the verge of further reducing weapons of mass destruction by embracing START II. We cannot and should not do anything to endanger the prospects for ratification of START II. I voted against the conference report in December precisely because it amounted to an anticipatory breach of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Further, the language contained in the bill would have had a significant impact on Russian consideration of the START II Treaty which will reduce Russian nuclear weapons by 25 percent. I am pleased to see that the language regarding the deployment of a national missile defense system was struck from the bill as well as the language restricting the President's ability to utilize U.S. troops for peacekeeping missions. It is clear by now that for all of the dire predictions and the harsh rhetoric aimed at the President's proposal to send troops to enforce the peace in Bosnia, the President's plan has largely been a success thus far. We have stopped the bloodshed and have ushered in new hope for the future of all Serbs, Muslims, and Croatians. While I applaud the compromise that was made with respect to this conference report, I am dismayed that the conference committee neglected to delete the abortion language and the language that discharges those HIV-positive service members. I think it is important for the Congress to take note that this was the first time in decades, a defense appropriations bill was enacted without an authorization bill being enacted first. I support the compromise version of the conference report knowing that this bill authorizes more money than I would personally prefer. But given the realities of our current mission in Bosnia, the need to maintain military readiness and move forward with defense conversion efforts, I believe it is important that we pass this bill and have the President sign it into law.

29,"BOSNIA POLICY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. Kaptur] is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss our Bosnia policy. In the past 4 years, nearly 250,000 people have been killed in that war-torn region, 2 million people have become refugees. Atrocities have been committed that have truly shocked the world. The region has been a tinder box for European instability for centuries. Thus the peace agreement agreed to by the Presidents of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia in Dayton, OH is indeed an historic step toward bringing peace and ultimate stability to this region. However, the deployment of over 20,000 United States troops to Bosnia to enforce the peace raises many questions. One lesson I have learned from history is that when Congress and the President are not at once with the American people, our Nation suffers. First, the Nation must be committed, and only then should we send troops. Sending troops to Bosnia without broader public consensus will prove to be a mistake. The President's recent efforts to convince the American people fell short of achieving that public support. May I ask, why in this post- cold war era, when our U.S. citizenry has been clamoring for more defense-burden sharing by our allies, has the United States again been asked to assume the central role in resolving this situation, even convening the peace talks in Dayton, OH rather than on the European continent. The short-term cost of U.S. participation will equal $2.6 billion. This entire matter is a defining moment in U.S. foreign policy in that the United States is being asked to substitute for European resolve in this post-cold war era. In the NATO nations of Europe, we have thousands of European trained, deployable troops that could be dispatched immediately to Bosnia in the event a final peace accord is signed in Paris. Let me read to you the list of European countries associated with NATO and the number of their combat ready troops. This does not even count their reserve forces: In Belgium, 63,000 troops. In Denmark, 27,000 troops. In France, 409,000 troops. In Germany, 367,000 troops. In Greece, 159,300 troops. In Italy, 322,300 troops. In Luxembourg, 800 troops. In the Netherlands, 70,900 troops. In Norway, 33,500 troops. In Portugal, 50,700 troops. In Spain, 206,500 troops. In Turkey, 503,800 troops. In the United Kingdom, 254,300 troops, bringing the total NATO active forces to over 2\1/2\ million war-ready forces. Identifying 20,000 ground troops from among these forces would represent less than a 1-percent additional commitment for NATO's European partners to enforce the peace. Is that too much to ask of them? If the United States maintains our logistical and our air support. The administration has stated that Europe, since 1914, has been unable to effectively maintain the peace and there was no other recourse but for the United States to assume the lead in bringing the warring factions to peaceful resolution. They have urged us not to become isolationists. The truth is, the long-term prospects for peace in this troubled region are very slim. Once the NATO troops withdraw, it will require 50 years of cooling off between the warring factions and maintenance of borders by external forces to give peace a chance. A 1-year quick fix is not going to do it. Who will commit to that long-term maintenance of peace? And who will pay for it? Is it not time for NATO's European partners to measure up to their common defense? The United States, as a partner in NATO, has a role in logistical and air support, but we should not be sending ground troops to Bosnia. NATO in Europe is perfectly capable of doing that on its own, if it wished to.

30,"{time} 2015 THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF SENDING IN AMERICAN TROOPS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Chrysler). Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Manzullo] is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, the people of this country are about to be subjected to a situation where 20,000 American troops will be sent into very difficult territory in the area that we know as Bosnia- Herzegovina. Let us take a look at the circumstances under which they will have to do that. I am holding the Proximity Peace Talks, which is an outline of the circumstances giving rise to the exact language of the peace talks. Listen to the country created by these peace talks. ``The country will be known as the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but the country will be split in two because it will also have two entities comprised of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Serb Republic. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina will control 51 percent of the country.'' I ask you, is that type of a situation tenable? Let me also throw something out here. There will not be one President on the new Constitution, there will not be two Presidents, it will be a troika, three Presidents, if that is correct. There will be three Presidents to run this country we know as the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That will be one Moslem, one Croat, and one Serb. Do you really think that a troika comprised of these three who have been fighting essentially for the past 1,500 years can get along? But, Mr. Speaker, more important is the fact that American troops will be sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina for the purpose of killing, if necessary, to protect the peace. That is correct. The language in this report says that the troops should use ``necessary force to ensure compliance.'' What does that mean? That means they can use the gig guns to clear out the 2\1/2\-mile-wide demilitarized zone, but it means something else. American troops actually under the NATO command will try to do one of two things. They will try to keep the big guns away from the Serbs, and if that does not work, then they will try to arm the Bosnians to try to bring about military parity. Mr. Speaker, this does not make sense. This is a peace agreement? A peace agreement means people shake hands, repent, reconcile, and say, ``Let's go on with our lives, and put the war behind us.'' But what has happened here is the fact our President is going to put American troops in the position of fighting the war that the Bosnians have not been allowed to fight themselves. That is right. The United Nations, with the approval of the President, has steadfastly refused to allow the Bosnians to have the weapons with which to defend themselves. That has cased the tremendous amount of carnage in that country. Now we have this great peace plan, the peace plan where Americans will be authorized to kill in order to enforce the peace. True peace in that area can only be brought about if the Americans [[Page H 13709]] leave the area, if NATO leaves the area, and we allow the Bosnians to arm themselves.

31,"DEMANDING INFORMATION ON THE WELFARE, WELL-BEING, AND WHEREABOUTS OF JOURNALIST DAVID ROHDE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Maine [Mr. Longley] is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. LONGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to express my serious concern over the welfare of an American journalist who has just been reported missing in Bosnia. I received a phone call from the father of David Rohde this morning indicating that--he was aged 28 and currently serving in the Balkans as a reporter, Eastern European correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor--I am advised that he has been reported missing as of last Saturday. American embassies in Belgrade, Zagreb, and Sarajevo are all assisting in attempts to locate Mr. Rohde, along with the United Nations. It is believed that David is being held at Pale, and the Christian Science Monitor quoted a U.S. State Department spokesman as saying that ``All indications are that Mr. Rhode was traveling in an area under the control of the Bosnian Serbs, and we hold them responsible for his safety.'' I have to confess, Mr. Speaker, that I have a personal interest in this. Not only is Mr. Rohde's father a constituent, but barely 4 years ago I served in uniform as a member of the U.S. Marine Corps. My responsibility in the early days of the American incursion into northern Iraq was to work with the international press corps who are in that part of the world, in that godforsaken part of the world, attempting to cover the story. I have nothing but profound admiration and respect for the courage and the integrity of the international press corps, particularly many of the brave American journalists who risk their lives on a daily basis to bring back to the American public information on critical crises around the world. Mr. Rohde is no exception to my observations. I might also note for the record that on the issues of Bosnia and the difficult conflict in the Balkans, I have tried to be scrupulously neutral. At no time have I favored any one side over the other. I feel, and have felt for a long time, that our interest in the Balkans is to ensure that all three warring countries resolve their differences and they they live together in peace. But there is a certain irony that on the very day that the peace process is beginning, in Dayton, OH, and that the Presidents of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia have arrived in our country, it is ironic that Mr. Rohde has been reported missing in one of those areas, possibly in the Bosnian-Serb area. I would say to the Presidents of those three countries and to the people of those three countries that your credibility is on the line.

Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Maine [Mr. Longley] is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. LONGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to express my serious concern over the welfare of an American journalist who has just been reported missing in Bosnia. I received a phone call from the father of David Rohde this morning indicating that--he was aged 28 and currently serving in the Balkans as a reporter, Eastern European correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor--I am advised that he has been reported missing as of last Saturday. American embassies in Belgrade, Zagreb, and Sarajevo are all assisting in attempts to locate Mr. Rohde, along with the United Nations. It is believed that David is being held at Pale, and the Christian Science Monitor quoted a U.S. State Department spokesman as saying that ``All indications are that Mr. Rhode was traveling in an area under the control of the Bosnian Serbs, and we hold them responsible for his safety.'' I have to confess, Mr. Speaker, that I have a personal interest in this. Not only is Mr. Rohde's father a constituent, but barely 4 years ago I served in uniform as a member of the U.S. Marine Corps. My responsibility in the early days of the American incursion into northern Iraq was to work with the international press corps who are in that part of the world, in that godforsaken part of the world, attempting to cover the story. I have nothing but profound admiration and respect for the courage and the integrity of the international press corps, particularly many of the brave American journalists who risk their lives on a daily basis to bring back to the American public information on critical crises around the world. Mr. Rohde is no exception to my observations. I might also note for the record that on the issues of Bosnia and the difficult conflict in the Balkans, I have tried to be scrupulously neutral. At no time have I favored any one side over the other. I feel, and have felt for a long time, that our interest in the Balkans is to ensure that all three warring countries resolve their differences and they they live together in peace. But there is a certain irony that on the very day that the peace process is beginning, in Dayton, OH, and that the Presidents of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia have arrived in our country, it is ironic that Mr. Rohde has been reported missing in one of those areas, possibly in the Bosnian-Serb area. I would say to the Presidents of those three countries and to the people of those three countries that your credibility is on the line. Whoever took David captive owes it to report immediately on his welfare and his well-being. We want an accounting of Mr. Rohde.

32,"SPECIAL CEREMONY FOR STEPHEN D. BAKRAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Stupak] is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to call to your attention and that of the U.S. House of Representatives a special ceremony that will be held this Friday, August 2, in Wells, MI, in my congressional district. On Friday, the family of Navy aviation Radioman Second Class Stephen D. Bakran will gather at the gardens of Rest Memorial Park in Wells, MI, as his remains are laid to rest. It is the tradition of our Nation to honor our war dead. What makes the ceremony for Airman Bakran so special is the fact that this important closure for the family comes more than five decades after this young man was killed in action. From Navy officials and other sources, we know that Stephen Bakran was part of a special bombing squadron on a unique mission assigned to the U.S.S. Ranger, CV-4, the first ship built from the keel up as an aircraft carrier. Stephen Bakran came to be aboard the Ranger after enlisting in the Navy on June 27, 1941, only weeks after his graduation from high school. The eldest son in a Catholic family of 11 children, Stephen is remembered by family, friends, teachers, and others as an honest, hard working, caring individual. The son of Croatian immigrants, Stephen is recalled in his role as a money earner for the family on his paper route, a dutiful son working in the family garden or tending the farm animals, and a responsible sibling changing and washing diapers of his younger brothers and sisters. Airman Bakran is part of the first U.S. carrier based mission launch against Nazi-held Norway. Code named Operation Leader, the planes of the mission sank Nazi shipping and caused other damage at the cost of two SBD-5 Dauntless scout bombers. One of these bombers that were downed claimed the lives of Stephen Bakran and his pilot, Lieutenant Clyde A. Tucker, Jr. of Alexandria, LA. Reports say that Stephen Bakran was still firing his machine gun as his plane went down on October 4, 1943. Although the Navy listed Stephen Bakran and Clyde Tucker as killed in action, it was not until 1990 that a Norwegian diving club and a Norwegian historical research vessel found the wreckage of the aircraft off the coast of Bodo, Norway, in 150 feet of water. It was not until July of 1993 that divers were able to locate and recover the two aviators. The remains of Clyde Tucker were identified in 1994 and are buried in Arlington National Cemetery. However, DNA tests did not conclusively identify the remains of Stephen Bakran until this year. I am pleased that I was able to assist the family by working with our military officials during the identification process, and now I am extremely grateful to everyone, including those who helped to find, identify and transport Steve Bakran back to his family where they will be able to find a final resting place for this fallen warrior. Today as we watch other families struggle with the tragedies of the disappearance of loved ones in a dark watery grave, we find comfort in witnessing that the search for our military missing in action never ends and the door of hope, hope that they may be found, never closes. Mr. Speaker, let us remember the Bakran family in our thoughts and prayers on Friday. I regret that I will not be able to attend the funeral, as I will be here attending to legislative business. The Bakran family, the Wells and Escanaba community will be at Steve's funeral, but my family will join the Bakran family in a final salute to our World War II Navy veteran who is laid to rest.

33,"THE UNTIMELY DEATH OF SECRETARY OF COMMERCE RON BROWN Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to comment briefly on the tragic death of Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, which occurred last week in Croatia. I have know Ron Brown and his family for 12 years. Ron was a friend of mine, and a friend of the State of California. One of his first duties as Commerce Secretary was to find ways to resuscitate California's economy, and he helped to do just that. Ron Brown made the Department of Commerce a positive force for helping the largest State in the Union recover from the devastating recession of the early 1990's. Ron had a vision of a prosperous America, where the cliche that ``a rising tide lifts all boats'' could actually come true. He focused his Department and this administration on looking for opportunities to help the American economy make the transition from the era of heavy industry to an era of high technology, scientific innovation, and the advancement of the current revolution in communications. Ron helped formulate this vision, made sure that his Department gave grants and other forms of assistance to firms pursuing it, and at the time of his death was advocating that vision to other parts of the world. But even more important than his career was the man himself. Always upbeat, with ceaseless energy, Ron could persuade the most vehement skeptic of the value of his vision and efforts for our country. He served in a variety of roles, and in each he excelled. His days as an effective leader with the National Urban League demonstrates this, where he became deputy executive director, general counsel and vice president of the Urban League's Washington, DC office. Ron Brown's boundless energy and commitment to excellence did not stop at the National Urban League. It continued to help him break racial boundaries and become the first African-American to head a major political party, helping to elect the country's first Democratic President in 12 years; the first African-American to become a partner in his powerful Washington, DC law firm; and the first African-American to take the helm at the U.S. Department of Commerce. I know of no chairman of the Democratic National Committee who was better regarded, whose fundraising calls were more frequently returned, or whose hardships and public statements were more well regarded--Ron Brown was tops. In my view, Ron Brown's stewardship as Secretary of Commerce was unparalleled. He truly cared about his work and those the Department serves, and the record reflects accurately billions of dollars in trade and new business that will, in the future, benefit this country's businesses and industrial base. I find the circumstances of his untimely death to be particularly poignant. Here he was, leading a group of business people and his staff, on a mission of peace to the war torn land of the former Yugoslavia. He did not wait for peace to be restored. He went when risks of hostile action were still present. He did not wait for pleasant weather before springing into action. And, he did not just work on economic issues. He also spent time with our troops over there, to let them know we support their efforts. Mr. President, we have lost a great American in Ron Brown. Whether it was politics, or crafting legislation for the Senate, or civil rights, or military service, or being a husband and a father, Ron Brown was a great patriot, and a great human being. I shall always treasure the relationship he and I had, and I shall miss him terribly. To Alma Brown and Tracy, who have traveled with me in the campaign, I send my heart and prayers. With all his family, I share an unrelenting emptiness and sadness. I will miss the phone calls, the smile, the exploits from progress, and, most of all, his abiding and consummate belief in all of us.

34,"NO UNITED STATES TROOPS DEPLOYMENT TO BOSNIA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of May 12, 1995, the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Manzullo] is recognized during morning business for 5 minutes. Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, the United States Congress will within a very short period of time take up the very delicate issue as to whether or not American fighting troops should be positioned in the country that we know as Bosnia and Herzegovina. For the past 3 years, our President has, without consulting Congress, made a commitment that somehow he is going to send 20,000 to 25,000 American troops to Bosnia and Herzegovina. {time} 1315 Now we find ourselves at this point in American history where this body has to make a reasoned decision as to whether or not we should put these young men and women in harm's way. We have to take a look at the historical background of this country as we know it. One can go back 1,000 or even 1,500 years to see continuous fighting on either side of the Balkans as the various tribes from the areas that we know as the former provinces of Yugoslavia, now independent nations, have risen up, engaged each other in mortal combat, then been quiet for a period of time only to have these types of prejudices flare up again and result in killing. The question is this: Does America have such a strategic interest in Bosnia and Herzegovina so as to commit our young men and women into combat? And that other question is this: If there is, indeed, a peace treaty, then why should our young men and women, as part of a NATO force, be sent in heavily armed for the purpose of killing to keep the peace? As I examined last night the very thick document that sets forth the memorandum of understanding among the parties to this horrible conflict, several points stood out, and I think the American people have a right to know the terms upon which American troops would be sent into this country. Let us take a look at the nature of the country that will be set up. There will be an elected house. There will not be a president; there will not be two presidents; there will be three presidents. Can you imagine a constitution that has a troika for a presidency and is able to rule? And, incidentally, each of these presidents have to come from each of the three warring factions, the Moslems, the Croats, and the Serbs. So now you take one of each, put them into a government and say, ``You rule.'' What is even more ironic is that in the constitution that will be set up is called the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and yet it is legally split, one country that is already split, and this is supposed to be a peace agreement. How is this peace agreement formed? Well, a demilitarized zone is set up. American troops have to pour in, and the language of the agreement says that the troops will use whatever force is reasonably necessary in order to carry out the peace plan. So that if the warring factions do not clear out of the DMZ, then after some type of a warning, presumably NATO forces will be called upon to shoot in order to secure a peace. Mr. Speaker, I ask the question: What type of peace is this? And that is not all. The agreement says that within a year the troops are to be withdrawn. So everybody gets together for a year, possibly acquiesces in a DMZ zone, and then knowing at the end of the year they can pull out only to have the fighting resume. But there is more to it than this. Mr. Speaker, I would encourage my colleagues to examine very closely the agreement before they vote in favor of this type of peace plan.

One can go back 1,000 or even 1,500 years to see continuous fighting on either side of the Balkans as the various tribes from the areas that we know as the former provinces of Yugoslavia, now independent nations, have risen up, engaged each other in mortal combat, then been quiet for a period of time only to have these types of prejudices flare up again and result in killing. The question is this: Does America have such a strategic interest in Bosnia and Herzegovina so as to commit our young men and women into combat? And that other question is this: If there is, indeed, a peace treaty, then why should our young men and women, as part of a NATO force, be sent in heavily armed for the purpose of killing to keep the peace? As I examined last night the very thick document that sets forth the memorandum of understanding among the parties to this horrible conflict, several points stood out, and I think the American people have a right to know the terms upon which American troops would be sent into this country. Let us take a look at the nature of the country that will be set up. There will be an elected house. There will not be a president; there will not be two presidents; there will be three presidents. Can you imagine a constitution that has a troika for a presidency and is able to rule? And, incidentally, each of these presidents have to come from each of the three warring factions, the Moslems, the Croats, and the Serbs. So now you take one of each, put them into a government and say, ``You rule.'' What is even more ironic is that in the constitution that will be set up is called the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and yet it is legally split, one country that is already split, and this is supposed to be a peace agreement. How is this peace agreement formed? Well, a demilitarized zone is set up. American troops have to pour in, and the language of the agreement says that the troops will use whatever force is reasonably necessary in order to carry out the peace plan. So that if the warring factions do not clear out of the DMZ, then after some type of a warning, presumably NATO forces will be called upon to shoot in order to secure a peace. Mr. Speaker, I ask the question: What type of peace is this? And that is not all. The agreement says that within a year the troops are to be withdrawn. So everybody gets together for a year, possibly acquiesces in a DMZ zone, and then knowing at the end of the year they can pull out only to have the fighting resume. But there is more to it than this. Mr. Speaker, I would encourage my colleagues to examine very closely the agreement before they vote in favor of this type of peace plan.

35,"SPEECH OF DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE STROBE TALBOT TO THE DELEGATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE U.S. CONGRESS ______ HON. TOM LANTOS of california in the house of representatives Friday, September 29, 1995 Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, last evening a delegation of the Members of the U.S. Congress hosted a dinner in honor of our colleagues of the European Parliament who are here in Washington for the semi-annual meetings between delegations of our two legislative bodies. The current meeting between our two [[Page E 1893]] delegations is the 44th meeting since this parliamentary exchange began not long after the European Parliament was established. Last night our two delegations had the honor and pleasure of hearing from our distinguished Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbot. His remarks were not sugar-coated, and they were not the light fare of an after dinner speech. Deputy Secretary Talbot gave us a very sober, thoughtful, and insightful analysis of the impact and consequences of the various appropriations and authorization bills that have been adopted by the House and Senate thus far this year. Fortunately, none of these bills have yet been approved by both Houses, and none have been enacted into law. Mr. Speaker, it is important that we fully understand the effect of these pieces of legislation before the members of this body uncritically vote again for the unfortunate legislation that has been approved already by one of the Houses of Congress. I ask that Deputy Secretary Talbot's remarks of last night be placed in the Record. Mr. Speaker, I sincerely urge my colleagues in the Congress to give serious, thoughtful, and careful consideration to these views. Prepared Remarks by Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbot, Congressional Dinner in Honor of European Parliamentarians Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representatives of the European parliament and of the diplomatic corps, members of the House and Senate, friends and colleagues, ladies and gentlemen: it's an honor to be here with you tonight. I want to join the rest of you in offering my thanks to Ben Gilman for his hospitality. Mr. Chairman, I bring greetings from Secretary Christopher, who is now at an event honoring the Israeli and Palestinian statesmen who, a few hours ago, took another bold step toward a comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East. Today's landmark agreement--like those in September 1993 and August 1994 that preceded it--is in no small measure the result of hard work by European, as well as American, diplomats. Today's good news also reflects bipartisan cooperation here in the United States going back over two decades and several Administrations, Republican and Democratic. Leaders from both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill have played an essential role in securing the funding for the Middle East peace process. I can only hope that in the future the same kind of cooperation--between the two branches of our government, and between our two parties--will be possible on other issues of abiding concern. As everyone here knows, the Clinton Administration and the 104th Congress have some serious differences, notably over the amount of money that Congress is prepared to allocate to the conduct of American foreign policy. There is a lot at stake in how this issue is resolved. If the cuts suggested by Senate appropriators are put into law, the State Department would be forced to close as many as a quarter of our posts worldwide--some 50 embassies and consulates, including in Europe and the Middle East. Other proposed cuts would force the United States to fall even further behind in its payments to international organizations. That would result in clear violations of our international obligations, including our Treaty obligations under the UN charter. These cuts would make all but impossible the kind of initiatives that have supported the Middle East peace process. The case for continuing American engagement in the world may be self-evident to everyone here this evening, but I'm not sure that it is obvious to all of your constituents, who include the citizens of Galway, Ireland, and Genoa, Italy, and Regensburg, Germany as well as those of Tampa, Florida, and Middletown, New York, and Bakersfield, California. Let me offer an explanation for why some in the United States are flirting with ideas and proposals that are isolationist in their potential consequence if not in their motivation. During the Cold War, many Americans defined what we were for--and what we were willing to pay for, and even fight and die for--largely in terms of what we were against. There was a world-class dragon out there for us--if not to slay, then at least to contain in its lair. For most Americans, the principal objective of American foreign policy--and the principal purpose of our diplomatic activity and military presence in Europe--could, quite literally, be reduced to a two- or three-word slogan: ``Contain Communism,'' or ``Deter Soviet aggression.'' There was, on the home front of American foreign policy, little doubt or dispute that we had a vital national interest in supporting institutions, and participating in ventures, that enabled us to protect ourselves and our Allies from the Red Menace. Today, the rationale for vigorous American international engagement--and for the resources to support it--will no longer fit on a bumper sticker. But it can fit easily enough into a single paragraph, which might go something like this: At the heart of President Clinton's foreign policy--and underlying much of his domestic policy as well--is a recognition that the world is increasingly integrated and a determination to make integration work in our favor. Integration means that, for good or for ill, one nation, region, or continent is susceptible to influences from others. Distances are shorter, borders more permeable. Commerce and culture ride the jet stream, the air waves, an the fiber-optic cables, to the betterment of all of us. But so do crime and terror, to our common peril. Those scourges, along with nuclear proliferation, infectious disease and environmental degradation, are truly international problems that demand international solutions. That means we must not only revitalize and enlarge existing institutions and arrangements and habits of cooperation, but we must also put in place new ones. The purpose of such enlargement, revitalization and innovation should be to make sure that the ties that bind us together are positive--that they benefit and strengthen us, individually and collectively; and that they enable us better to deal with common threats and enemies. Therefore, it is no less important today than it was during the nearly fifty years of the Cold War that the United States remain engaged in the world--and especially, I stress: especially in Europe. I emphasize the transatlantic dimension of America's international role not just because I am speaking to visitors from across that particular ocean. And not just because the ties between the United States and Europe date back to our colonial origins. I do so because what happens in Europe is key to what happens everywhere else. The Cold War was a global struggle. But it began in Europe, and it ended there. It is in Europe that, together, we are establishing the guiding principles of the post-Cold War era. It is also there that we are facing the most daunting tests of our ability to concert our energies and our wisdom--and thus to defeat the most serious threats to our common interests and our shared goals. As Secretary Christopher said last June in Madrid, ``every generation must renew the [Transatlantic] partnership by adapting it to meet the challenge of its time.'' The challenge for our generation is in large part economic and commercial. As leading economic powers, the United States and the nations of Europe share an interest in a vibrant open trading system. That means that we must apply to the elimination of trade barriers the same far-sightedness and sense of common purpose that we applied to tearing down the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain. And there still are such barriers, both between Western and Central Europe, and between the European Union and the United States . The need to eliminate these barriers takes on added importance in light of the worrisome long-term economic trends that the transatlantic community faces--stagnant income growth in North America, and stubborn unemployment in Europe. We can certainly do better--and that means better by our own people--if we further open our markets to one another. Let me, if I may, now speak about integration and cooperation in the realm of our common political values and our common security interests. The goal of peace, stability and cooperation among nations is as near fulfillment in Europe as it is anywhere on earth; but it is also in Europe that this goal faces one of its greatest dangers. That may sound paradoxical, but it is actually quite natural, since Europe has been the site of both the best and the worst in human history, especially in this century. Europe is, after all, both the birthplace and the graveyard of fascism and communism. The political culture that nurtured, if that's the word, the monstrosities perpetrated in the name of Kark Marx and in the careers of Hitler and Mussolini also made possible the realization of the dream of Jean Monnet. So it is understandable that Europe today, as this century comes to an end, should provide the most promising and advanced example of integration--dramatized by the very existence of a European Parliament--while, simultaneously, it confronts us, in the former Yugoslavia, with the most vexing and dangerous example of disintegration. Over the past four years, the tragedy and horror in the Balkans has occasioned a good deal of finger pointing back and forth across the Atlantic. That is as understandable as it is regrettable. After all, when it seems too hard to fix a problem of this magnitude, it is all too easy to fix the blame on someone else. But in recent months, and particularly in recent weeks and days, the situation, while still perilous, has become more hopeful. A turning point came, I believe, at the London Conference in late July. That gathering of seventeen nations crystallized the resolve of the international community to back diplomacy with force, and it streamlined the mechanism for doing so. The day before yesterday, Secretary Christopher, Assistant Secretary of State Holbrooke, and EU special envoy Carl Bildt announced another breakthrough in the negotiations over the constitutional underpinnings of a Bosnian peace settlement. As we speak, Ambassador Holbrooke is flying back to the region for more negotiations. When future historians write the history of this episode-- the worst conflict in Europe since the end of World War II and the first major threat to peace on the Continent in the post-Cold War era--they may give us credit for getting it right, although they will unquestionably regret that we took so long to do so. I, for one, will settle for that verdict. But I also hope that future historians will note that we drew the right lessons. And first among these is the need for the United States to work with individual European [[Page E 1894]] governments as well as with collective European institutions to prevent such conflicts in the future, and to increase our capacity to resolve them if they do occur. There are many organizations that have vital roles to play in this regard, notably the OSCE. But as we are now seeing in the Balkans, the two most important institutions are, and will continue to be, the EU and NATO. The EU is the foundation for future economic growth and prosperity across the continent, while NATO is the bulwark of transatlantic security and the linchpin of American engagement in Europe. Let me say a word about why both should take in new members. Over the past six years, virtually all of the peoples of Central Europe and the former Soviet Union have undertaken dramatic reforms. They have toppled communist dictatorships, liberalized command economies, and begun the hard work of building stable, secure, independent, democratic, market- oriented and prosperous states, at peace with their own populations and at peace with their neighbors. But those reforms are not guaranteed to continue or succeed. All of these countries, whether they have gained their freedom for the first time or recovered the sovereignty that they lost earlier in the century, are embarked on a difficult transition that will take years, if not decades, if not a generation or more. It is in our interest as well as their own that they succeed. That is why the United States is counting on the European Union to expand. Only the EU can offer the newly liberalized economies of these newly liberated nations the markets they need to continue and complete their evolutions. Only EU membership can lock in the essential political, economic and social reforms that these emerging democracies are now implementing. We understand the political difficulties involved in expansion. We know that the candidate members will have to work hard to meet the conditions of membership. But we also hope that current EU members will approach the question of expansion with an open mind, understanding the benefits to all. Now, a few words about NATO-an organization that includes twelve members of the EU but that also serves as an anchor of American and Canadian commitment to the Continent's security. Earlier today, NATO Secretary General Willy Claes held a briefing in Brussels for representatives from twenty-six nations in Central Europe and the former Soviet Union on the rationale and process of NATO enlargement. This morning, as part of President Clinton's commitment to full consultations with Congress, we provided staff members with that same briefing. As today's briefings make clear, the enlargement of NATO will bolster democratization and regional stability in the region that used to be the domain of the Warsaw Pact. But this process is going to require skill and steadiness in many respects. We must--pursue the goal of NATO enlargement in a way that genuinely and comprehensively advances the larger one of integration; that does not, in other words, create a new division in Europe. With that imperative in mind, the Alliance is well on its way to developing new ways to promote cooperation with the armed forces of the non-NATO European states. Under the banner of the Partnership for Peace, nations that have been enemies in the past are now conducting joint peacekeeping exercises: Albanians and Greeks, Bulgarians and Turks, Hungarians and Romanians. In August, soldiers from three Allied and fourteen Partnership countries trained together at Fort Polk in Louisiana; another set of exercises will begin in Vyskov in the Czech Republic this weekend; and starting on Monday there will be a maritime training maneuver in the Skagerrak Channel off the north coast of Denmark. In order to ensure that NATO enlargement does indeed serve the larger cause of post-Cold War integration, the Alliance is prepared, in parallel with the process of bringing in new members, to conduct a dialogue, and eventually to develop a more formal relationship, with the Russian Federation. That way, all parties will be assured that the emergence of the new security order in Europe respects, and enhances, their legitimate interests. This goal may sound rather abstract, but we have, in the work that our governments are doing with the Russian Federation today, an opportunity to make cooperation between NATO and Russia concrete, practical, productive and promising, both for the immediate cause of peace in the Balkans and for the long-range one of European security and integration. Earlier today, President Clinton and Foreign Minister Kozyrev met in the White House and agreed that Russia and the members of NATO have a shared interest in cooperating closely in implementing the settlement that will, we all hope, emerge from the current negotiations. Of course, any U.S. participation in a peace implementation plan will be under NATO command and control, and we are committed to full consultations with the Congress as the planning unfolds. So the paradox of the former Yugoslavia can, I believe, still be turned to a net advantage for the future of Europe: the most immediate and dangerous challenge we face offers a historic opportunity for pan-European and Transatlantic cooperation. In the relatively near future, peacekeepers from NATO and former Warsaw Pack countries could be working side- by-side to implement a peace settlement. Let me close with reference to a European city that is not represented by any of you here tonight: Sarajevo. In 1914, its citizens heard the first shot of what became known as the Great War, the conflagration that plunged Europe into darkness. Seventy years later, another generation of Sarajevans were the hosts of the 1984 Olympic Games. They distinguished themselves, however briefly, in the eyes of the world as a model multi-ethnic, multifaith community. Serbs and Croats--Orthodox, Catholics, Jews and Muslims--lived together in harmony. For most of the past four years, this same city has been besieged; its citizens struck down by snipers and torn limb from limb by mortars; its outskirts the site of mass graves for the victims of genocide. But there is now some hope that this same city could, before this year is out, be universally recognized, including by Serbia and Croatia, as the capital of a unitary state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In which case it would be, once again, as it was during the Olympics eleven years ago, a symbol of Europe's--and the world's--noblest aspirations. We might dare to imagine that a politician from Sarajevo may, in the not-too-distant future, take a seat in the European Parliament. In that capacity he or she might even have the honor, as I have tonight, of addressing a meeting of this biannual interparliamentary gathering. Of course, that will happen only if the current negotiations stay on track, and that's a very big if indeed. So it's appropriate, Mr. Chairman, that at the end of the evening tonight, you'll be serving us coffee and not champagne. It's too early to celebrate a victory or congratulate ourselves on success. There's plenty of hard work ahead. But it's not too early to see where we want to go and to reaffirm our determination to get there together.

Only EU membership can lock in the essential political, economic and social reforms that these emerging democracies are now implementing. We understand the political difficulties involved in expansion. We know that the candidate members will have to work hard to meet the conditions of membership. But we also hope that current EU members will approach the question of expansion with an open mind, understanding the benefits to all. Now, a few words about NATO-an organization that includes twelve members of the EU but that also serves as an anchor of American and Canadian commitment to the Continent's security. Earlier today, NATO Secretary General Willy Claes held a briefing in Brussels for representatives from twenty-six nations in Central Europe and the former Soviet Union on the rationale and process of NATO enlargement. This morning, as part of President Clinton's commitment to full consultations with Congress, we provided staff members with that same briefing. As today's briefings make clear, the enlargement of NATO will bolster democratization and regional stability in the region that used to be the domain of the Warsaw Pact. But this process is going to require skill and steadiness in many respects. We must--pursue the goal of NATO enlargement in a way that genuinely and comprehensively advances the larger one of integration; that does not, in other words, create a new division in Europe. With that imperative in mind, the Alliance is well on its way to developing new ways to promote cooperation with the armed forces of the non-NATO European states. Under the banner of the Partnership for Peace, nations that have been enemies in the past are now conducting joint peacekeeping exercises: Albanians and Greeks, Bulgarians and Turks, Hungarians and Romanians. In August, soldiers from three Allied and fourteen Partnership countries trained together at Fort Polk in Louisiana; another set of exercises will begin in Vyskov in the Czech Republic this weekend; and starting on Monday there will be a maritime training maneuver in the Skagerrak Channel off the north coast of Denmark. In order to ensure that NATO enlargement does indeed serve the larger cause of post-Cold War integration, the Alliance is prepared, in parallel with the process of bringing in new members, to conduct a dialogue, and eventually to develop a more formal relationship, with the Russian Federation. That way, all parties will be assured that the emergence of the new security order in Europe respects, and enhances, their legitimate interests. This goal may sound rather abstract, but we have, in the work that our governments are doing with the Russian Federation today, an opportunity to make cooperation between NATO and Russia concrete, practical, productive and promising, both for the immediate cause of peace in the Balkans and for the long-range one of European security and integration. Earlier today, President Clinton and Foreign Minister Kozyrev met in the White House and agreed that Russia and the members of NATO have a shared interest in cooperating closely in implementing the settlement that will, we all hope, emerge from the current negotiations. Of course, any U.S. participation in a peace implementation plan will be under NATO command and control, and we are committed to full consultations with the Congress as the planning unfolds. So the paradox of the former Yugoslavia can, I believe, still be turned to a net advantage for the future of Europe: the most immediate and dangerous challenge we face offers a historic opportunity for pan-European and Transatlantic cooperation. In the relatively near future, peacekeepers from NATO and former Warsaw Pack countries could be working side- by-side to implement a peace settlement. Let me close with reference to a European city that is not represented by any of you here tonight: Sarajevo. In 1914, its citizens heard the first shot of what became known as the Great War, the conflagration that plunged Europe into darkness. Seventy years later, another generation of Sarajevans were the hosts of the 1984 Olympic Games. They distinguished themselves, however briefly, in the eyes of the world as a model multi-ethnic, multifaith community. Serbs and Croats--Orthodox, Catholics, Jews and Muslims--lived together in harmony. For most of the past four years, this same city has been besieged; its citizens struck down by snipers and torn limb from limb by mortars; its outskirts the site of mass graves for the victims of genocide. But there is now some hope that this same city could, before this year is out, be universally recognized, including by Serbia and Croatia, as the capital of a unitary state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In which case it would be, once again, as it was during the Olympics eleven years ago, a symbol of Europe's--and the world's--noblest aspirations. We might dare to imagine that a politician from Sarajevo may, in the not-too-distant future, take a seat in the European Parliament. In that capacity he or she might even have the honor, as I have tonight, of addressing a meeting of this biannual interparliamentary gathering. Of course, that will happen only if the current negotiations stay on track, and that's a very big if indeed. So it's appropriate, Mr. Chairman, that at the end of the evening tonight, you'll be serving us coffee and not champagne. It's too early to celebrate a victory or congratulate ourselves on success. There's plenty of hard work ahead. But it's not too early to see where we want to go and to reaffirm our determination to get there together. ","['HON. TOM ', 'LANTOS ', 'of california in the house of representatives Friday, September 29, 1995 ', 'Mr. LANTOS.', ' Mr. Speaker, last evening a delegation of the Members of the U.S. Congress hosted a dinner in honor of our colleagues of the European Parliament who are here in Washington for the semi-annual meetings between delegations of our two legislative bodies. The current meeting between our two [[', 'Page E ', '1893]] delegations is the 44th meeting since this parliamentary exchange began not long after the European Parliament was established. Last night our two delegations had the honor and pleasure of hearing from our distinguished Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbot. His remarks were not sugar-coated, and they were not the light fare of an after dinner speech. Deputy Secretary Talbot gave us a very sober, thoughtful, and insightful analysis of the impact and consequences of the various appropriations and authorization bills that have been adopted by the House and Senate thus far this year. Fortunately, none of these bills have yet been approved by both Houses, and none have been enacted into law. Mr. Speaker, it is important that we fully understand the effect of these pieces of legislation before the members of this body uncritically vote again for the unfortunate legislation that has been approved already by one of the Houses of ', 'Congress. I ', ""ask that Deputy Secretary Talbot's remarks of last night be placed in the Record. Mr. "", 'Speaker, I ', ""sincerely urge my colleagues in the Congress to give serious, thoughtful, and careful consideration to these views. Prepared Remarks by Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbot, Congressional Dinner in Honor of European Parliamentarians Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representatives of the European parliament and of the diplomatic corps, members of the House and Senate, friends and colleagues, ladies and gentlemen: it's an honor to be here with you tonight. I want to join the rest of you in offering my thanks to Ben Gilman for his hospitality. Mr. "", 'Chairman, I ', ""bring greetings from Secretary Christopher, who is now at an event honoring the Israeli and Palestinian statesmen who, a few hours ago, took another bold step toward a comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East. Today's landmark agreement--like those in September 1993 and August 1994 that preceded it--is in no small measure the result of hard work by European, as well as American, diplomats. Today's good news also reflects bipartisan cooperation here in the United States going back over two decades and several Administrations, Republican and Democratic. Leaders from both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill have played an essential role in securing the funding for the Middle East peace process. I can only hope that in the future the same kind of cooperation--between the two branches of our government, and between our two parties--will be possible on other issues of abiding concern. As everyone here knows, the Clinton Administration and the 104th Congress have some serious differences, notably over the amount of money that Congress is prepared to allocate to the conduct of American foreign policy. There is a lot at stake in how this issue is resolved. If the cuts suggested by Senate appropriators are put into law, the State Department would be forced to close as many as a quarter of our posts worldwide--some 50 embassies and consulates, including in Europe and the Middle East. Other proposed cuts would force the United States to fall even further behind in its payments to international organizations. That would result in clear violations of our international obligations, including our Treaty obligations under the UN charter. These cuts would make all but impossible the kind of initiatives that have supported the Middle East peace process. The case for continuing American engagement in the world may be self-evident to everyone here this evening, but I'm not sure that it is obvious to all of your constituents, who include the citizens of Galway, Ireland, and Genoa, Italy, and Regensburg, Germany as well as those of Tampa, Florida, and Middletown, New York, and Bakersfield, California. Let me offer an explanation for why some in the United States are flirting with ideas and proposals that are isolationist in their potential consequence if not in their motivation. During the Cold War, many Americans defined what we were for--and what we were willing to pay for, and even fight and die for--largely in terms of what we were against. There was a world-class dragon out there for us--if not to slay, then at least to contain in its lair. For most Americans, the principal objective of American foreign policy--and the principal purpose of our diplomatic activity and military presence in Europe--could, quite literally, be reduced to a two- or three-word slogan: ``Contain Communism,'' or ``Deter Soviet aggression.'' There was, on the home front of American foreign policy, little doubt or dispute that we had a vital national interest in supporting institutions, and participating in ventures, that enabled us to protect ourselves and our Allies from the Red Menace. Today, the rationale for vigorous American international engagement--and for the resources to support it--will no longer fit on a bumper sticker. But it can fit easily enough into a single paragraph, which might go something like this: At the heart of President Clinton's foreign policy--and underlying much of his domestic policy as well--is a recognition that the world is increasingly integrated and a determination to make integration work in our favor. Integration means that, for good or for ill, one nation, region, or continent is susceptible to influences from others. Distances are shorter, borders more permeable. Commerce and culture ride the jet stream, the air waves, an the fiber-optic cables, to the betterment of all of us. But so do crime and terror, to our common peril. Those scourges, along with nuclear proliferation, infectious disease and environmental degradation, are truly international problems that demand international solutions. That means we must not only revitalize and enlarge existing institutions and arrangements and habits of cooperation, but we must also put in place new ones. The purpose of such enlargement, revitalization and innovation should be to make sure that the ties that bind us together are positive--that they benefit and strengthen us, individually and collectively; and that they enable us better to deal with common threats and enemies. Therefore, it is no less important today than it was during the nearly fifty years of the Cold War that the United States remain engaged in the world--and especially, I stress: especially in "", 'Europe. I ', ""emphasize the transatlantic dimension of America's international role not just because I am speaking to visitors from across that particular ocean. And not just because the ties between the United States and Europe date back to our colonial origins. I do so because what happens in Europe is key to what happens everywhere else. The Cold War was a global struggle. But it began in Europe, and it ended there. It is in Europe that, together, we are establishing the guiding principles of the post-Cold War era. It is also there that we are facing the most daunting tests of our ability to concert our energies and our wisdom--and thus to defeat the most serious threats to our common interests and our shared goals. As Secretary Christopher said last June in Madrid, ``every generation must renew the [Transatlantic] partnership by adapting it to meet the challenge of its time.'' The challenge for our generation is in large part economic and commercial. As leading economic powers, the United States and the nations of Europe share an interest in a vibrant open trading system. That means that we must apply to the elimination of trade barriers the same far-sightedness and sense of common purpose that we applied to tearing down the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain. And there still are such barriers, both between Western and Central Europe, and between the European Union and the United States . The need to eliminate these barriers takes on added importance in light of the worrisome long-term economic trends that the transatlantic community faces--stagnant income growth in North America, and stubborn unemployment in Europe. We can certainly do better--and that means better by our own people--if we further open our markets to one another. Let me, if I may, now speak about integration and cooperation in the realm of our common political values and our common security interests. The goal of peace, stability and cooperation among nations is as near fulfillment in Europe as it is anywhere on earth; but it is also in Europe that this goal faces one of its greatest dangers. That may sound paradoxical, but it is actually quite natural, since Europe has been the site of both the best and the worst in human history, especially in this century. Europe is, after all, both the birthplace and the graveyard of fascism and communism. The political culture that nurtured, if that's the word, the monstrosities perpetrated in the name of Kark Marx and in the careers of Hitler and Mussolini also made possible the realization of the dream of Jean Monnet. So it is understandable that Europe today, as this century comes to an end, should provide the most promising and advanced example of integration--dramatized by the very existence of a European Parliament--while, simultaneously, it confronts us, in the former Yugoslavia, with the most vexing and dangerous example of disintegration. Over the past four years, the tragedy and horror in the Balkans has occasioned a good deal of finger pointing back and forth across the Atlantic. That is as understandable as it is regrettable. After all, when it seems too hard to fix a problem of this magnitude, it is all too easy to fix the blame on someone else. But in recent months, and particularly in recent weeks and days, the situation, while still perilous, has become more hopeful. A turning point came, I believe, at the London Conference in late July. That gathering of seventeen nations crystallized the resolve of the international community to back diplomacy with force, and it streamlined the mechanism for doing so. The day before yesterday, Secretary Christopher, Assistant Secretary of State Holbrooke, and EU special envoy Carl Bildt announced another breakthrough in the negotiations over the constitutional underpinnings of a Bosnian peace settlement. As we speak, Ambassador Holbrooke is flying back to the region for more negotiations. When future historians write the history of this episode-- the worst conflict in Europe since the end of World "", 'War II ', 'and the first major threat to peace on the Continent in the post-Cold War era--they may give us credit for getting it right, although they will unquestionably regret that we took so long to do so. I, for one, will settle for that verdict. ', 'But I ', 'also hope that future historians will note that we drew the right lessons. And first among these is the need for the United States to work with individual European [[', 'Page E ', '1894]] governments as well as with collective European institutions to prevent such conflicts in the future, and to increase our capacity to resolve them if they do occur. There are many organizations that have vital roles to play in this regard, notably the ', 'OSCE.', ' But as we are now seeing in the Balkans, the two most important institutions are, and will continue to be, the EU and ', 'NATO.', ' ', 'The EU ', 'is the foundation for future economic growth and prosperity across the continent, while ', 'NATO ', 'is the bulwark of transatlantic security and the linchpin of American engagement in Europe. Let me say a word about why both should take in new members. Over the past six years, virtually all of the peoples of Central Europe and the former Soviet Union have undertaken dramatic reforms. They have toppled communist dictatorships, liberalized command economies, and begun the hard work of building stable, secure, independent, democratic, market- oriented and prosperous states, at peace with their own populations and at peace with their neighbors. But those reforms are not guaranteed to continue or succeed. All of these countries, whether they have gained their freedom for the first time or recovered the sovereignty that they lost earlier in the century, are embarked on a difficult transition that will take years, if not decades, if not a generation or more. It is in our interest as well as their own that they succeed. That is why the United States is counting on the European Union to expand. Only the EU can offer the newly liberalized economies of these newly liberated nations the markets they need to continue and complete their evolutions. ', 'Only EU ', 'membership can lock in the essential political, economic and social reforms that these emerging democracies are now implementing. We understand the political difficulties involved in expansion. We know that the candidate members will have to work hard to meet the conditions of membership. But we also hope that current EU members will approach the question of expansion with an open mind, understanding the benefits to all. Now, a few words about ', 'NATO-', ""an organization that includes twelve members of the EU but that also serves as an anchor of American and Canadian commitment to the Continent's security.

36,"GPO SUPPORT ON BOSNIA DIFFERS FROM DEMOCRATS' BALKING ON GULF ______ HON. DOUG BEREUTER of nebraska in the house of representatives Thursday, December 7, 1995 Mr. BEREUTER. Mr. Speaker, this Member commends to his colleagues an editorial which appeared in the Omaha World-Herald on December 5, 1995. GOP Support on Bosnia Differs From Democrats' Balking on Gulf In January 1991, the U.S. Senate voted 52-47 to approve a resolution authorizing President George Bush to use force in liberating Kuwait. Forty-five of the Senate's 55 Democrats voted against the resolution, including some of the party's top leaders. Among the Senate Democrats casting ``no'' votes were George Mitchell, then the majority leader; Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee; and Sam Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Sen. Edward Kennedy voted against the resolution. So did Daniel Moynihan and Lloyd Bentsen. So did Bob Kerrey. In the House, which approved the resolution 250-183, Democrats voting no included Speaker Tom Foley and Majority Leader Richard Gephardt. A number of those same Democrats in 1995 support a mission in which the U.S. interest is much less clear: President Clinton's commitment to send troops to Bosnia, But this time something is different. Clinton has support--qualified in some instances--from key members of the other party. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole said he will support Clinton's position. So has Sen. Richard Lugar, chairman of the Foreign relations Committee. In the House, Speaker Newt Gingrich has discouraged Republican congressmen who wanted to try to stop the Bosnian operation. For those GOP leaders, apparently, partisanship still ends at the water's edge, as it should. How, was it possible for the Democrats in 1991 to say no to the liberation of Kuwait and just about five years later support a vague mission in Bosnia that has little to do with America's vital national interests? Certainly the issues weren't identical. The 1991 vote gave Bush authorization for a ground war against what was then widely reported to be a formidable Iraqi army. Clinton's intended dispatch of 32,000 troops to Bosnia is based on the assumption, although it's debatable, that combat can be avoided. Some of the Bush critics in 1991 said it was wrong to go to war for oil. Kerrey, as a presidential candidate in October 1991, told a New Hampshire audience that he rejected the Kuwait resolution 10 months earlier because the main reason was to protect an oil source. (Some Americans thought that preserving an essential source of fuel for the industrial West was a good reason to liberate Kuwait and make sure Saudi Arabia wouldn't fall to Saddam Hussein.) If Bush had emphasized the restoration of freedom in Kuwait, Kerrey said, he might have supported the action. However, the 1991 resolution that the 45 Senate Democrats voted against did not mention oil. It stated that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was unprovoked, illegal and brutal and that the United Nations had authorized its members ``to use all necessary means'' to ensure that ``Kuwait's independence and legitimate government be restored.'' Whether or not one agreed with Bush, the mission was clear: Beat back an illegal aggressor threatening to roll over a region that had a direct impact on American interests and would continue to have an impact. Iraq had overrun Kuwait and was poised to move into Saudi Arabia. There was an immediate danger that the war would spread throughout the region, perhaps drawing in Israel. Contrast that with the Balkan situation. Ethnic and religious passions have fueled centuries of hatred, bitterness and wartime atrocities. None of the parties to the current conflict--the primarily Catholic Croatians, the Orthodox-Christian Bosnian Serbs or the Muslim majority in Bosnia--has an unblemished record. They are waging what amounts to a religious and territorial civil war. Some are angry that their leaders signed a truce. As to the danger of an expanded war, few indications exist that any outside powers were planning to come to the aid of the warring factions. Yet the Clinton policy would place U.S. troops on the ground in that situation. And for what national interest? The president should be grateful that his Republican opponents aren't guided by the way the Democrats behaved in 1991, when the threat to the national interest was genuine.

Yet the Clinton policy would place U.S. troops on the ground in that situation. And for what national interest? The president should be grateful that his Republican opponents aren't guided by the way the Democrats behaved in 1991, when the threat to the national interest was genuine. ""]"
37,"IS BOSNIA WORTH DYING FOR? The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. Duncan] is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, in 1961, President Kennedy said: We must face the fact that the U.S. is neither omnipotent nor omniscient--that we are only 6% of the world's population--that we cannot impose our will upon the other 94%--that we cannot right every wrong or reverse each adversity--and that therefore there cannot be an American solution to every world problem. President Kennedy was right then, and his words are good advice today. We should follow this advice in regard to the situation in Bosnia. Last week, the cover of Time magazine showed an American soldier and asked the question: ``Is Bosnia worth dying for?'' I believe the overwhelming majority of the American people would answer with an emphatic ``no.'' It should be for Bosnians because that is their homeland, but not for young Americans. This is a limited ethnic conflict that has been going on for hundreds of years, and will continue unless we pour many billions in to stop it. And as soon as we stop pouring in billions, the situation will go right back like it was. We should not send young American soldiers onto foreign battlefields unless there is a serious threat to our national security or unless there is a very real and very vital U.S. interest at stake. Neither of these is present in Bosnia. Yet now, the President, regardless of how the American people feel, regardless of how the Congress votes, is going to send 20,000 troops into Bosnia. We will then have another 20,000 in immediate nearby support in Croatia, the Adriatic Sea, and other places. I had one veteran who called me last night who said that he was always told in Vietnam that it took seven troops in the rear to support one in the field. We are making a tremendous commitment here. The worst thing is putting so many American lives at risk. Then there is the huge money involved. We are told right off the bat that this effort will cost a minimum of $1.6 billion for the troops in the field. We have promised another $600 million in direct foreign aid. That is an initial $2.2 billion and that is just the tip of the iceberg. I now am told that the Bosnian leadership says they will need $35 billion in loans or aid from the World Bank or other sources to rebuild their country. Most of this will end up coming from the United States. B.J. Cutler, the foreign affairs columnist for the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain, wrote several months ago: If guarding people from the savagery of their rulers is America's duty, it would be fighting all over the world, squandering lives and bankrupting itself. He was not writing about Bosnia, but his words are certainly applicable here. There are at least 15 or 16 small wars going on around the world at any time. Some people say many more than that. Why then are we trying to solve this insolvable problem. Well, I think in part it is because our national media focused on this one. But, I think the larger reason is that some people in high positions in this country are never satisfied with just running the United States. They want to make a place for themselves in history. They want to be described as, or thought of as, world leaders. That is why I believe there is such a class division on this. Many upper-crust liberal elitist types--many NPR devotees, are all for this--because they want to prove to everyone that they care about foreign policy and are concerned about world affairs. Horror of horrors, they certainly don't want to be associated with low-class, unintellectual isolationists. That would not be fashionable, that would not be politically correct. But, Mr. Speaker, even one American life is too many and all these billions it will cost is to high a price to pay just so a few people in our Government can display world leadership and show their superiority to their unenlightened fellow citizens. We should not get involved in this Bosnian quagmire. The potential dangers and costs are simply too high. The United States leads the world in humanitarian and charitable aid for those in other countries. No other nation is even a close second. Most Americans want to help out in international tragedies. We are already doing far more than our share. France, Germany, Sweden, Japan, and others are not even coming close. We have no reason to feel guilty. And, I repeat, Mr. Speaker, what I said at the beginning. We do not need to get involved militarily in Bosnia or anywhere else unless there is a real threat to our national security or a vital U.S. interest at stake. Neither of these is present in Bosnia.

38,"[[Page E 1329]] THE UNITED NATIONS AT 50: BAD IN BOSNIA; TIME TO GROW UP ______ HON. GEORGE P. RADANOVICH of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 27, 1995 Mr. RADANOVICH. Mr. Speaker, I'm going to withhold wishing the United Nations a ``happy birthday'' until it grows up. My particular problem with this international organization--chartered for a mighty mission and with the best of intentions--comes into clear focus when you look at the sorry state of its performance in Bosnia. As so often is the case, the editors of the Wall Street Journal have offered their readers an insightful and incisive examination of current conditions. That is the case with today's editorial, ``Virtual United Nations,'' which I am pleased to draw to the attention of my colleagues in Congress. [From the Wall Street Journal, June 27, 1995] Virtual United Nations Fifty years ago this week, representatives of 50 countries gathered in San Francisco to sign the Charter of the United Nations. It was probably both the novelty of peace in Europe and the dream that it would spread and last that inspired the U.N.'s signatories to pledge to ``save succeeding generations from the scourge of war'' by practicing ``tolerance and [living] together in peace,'' by uniting ``our strength to maintain international peace and security'' and by accepting ``principles and the institution of methods'' so that ``armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest.'' Fine as they are, it is difficult to imagine that these words sounded any less like rules for a virtual reality world then than they do today. Then as now, people like to believe that having such intentions is important, no matter that war is raging in Bosnia under the U.S.'s watchful eye. This 50th anniversary year of the U.N. features far more debates about how the U.N. needs to be reformed than recounting of its successes. But these ideas do not address the key failings of the U.N. that are visible all around us. These are not just the shortcomings that can be attributed to the dearth of collective interest and political will. They are also uniquely U.N.-inspired instances of failing to do what the organization and its bodies say it is dedicated to doing. The failure of the U.N. in Bosnia is too grand to describe exhaustively or even in thematic terms, so events of last week will have to suffice. The refusal of the United Nations to authorize a NATO request for an air strike on a U.N.- mandated target last week was merely the lastest in a series of such vetoes. A new type of failure of the U.N. was also on display last week in Belgrade. There, the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees is complaining that it is besieged by draft-age ethnic Serb men--mainly refugees from Bosnia and Croatia--who are being rounded up for conscription into the rump-Yugoslav army. Figures given by the office are that as many as 2,500 men have already been press-ganged, and 70 ``begging for some sort of protection'' were turned away by UNHCR on Thursday alone. Also last week was Le Monde's report that for a year the United Nations has been sitting on a report written by its own people that shows that the Serbs alone have pursued ethnic cleansing as a planned and systematic government policy and that they have been responsible for the vast majority of the other war crimes and atrocities. The report makes the explicit admission that it is not possible to treat all of the parties in the Bosnian conflict on an equal basis. The U.N. not only made this pretense possible, but also dressed it up with the mantle of the world's prominent international mediating body. This farce of moral equivalence continues despite the existence of the U.N.'s report and was most recently on display on Friday when the Security Council condemned Bosnian Muslim army efforts to block the movement of Unprofor forces in its attempt to lift the siege of Sarajevo. To be sure, many organizations and individual states have failed Bosnia. But the U.N. is the body that purports to be competent in such situations. Worse than inaction (which the U.N. could then blame on member-state cowardice), the U.N.'s actions have in many ways worsened the conflict. Those who talk of U.N. reform are therefore the most optimistic of the pundits. Many believe the body is simply unreformable because consensus of the type that existed in 1944 and 1945 would be impossible to find today. Presumably there is a role for such an organization, though perhaps confined to a talk shop. Yet as long as the U.N. undermines its own goals, as it has in Bosnia by refusing to acknowledge and condemn blatant aggression, any hope that it will somehow develop into a useful forum for conflict resolution are likely to be disappointed.

39,"GLARING DEFICIENCIES IN U.S. FOREIGN POLICY ______ HON. DOUG BEREUTER of nebraska in the house of representatives Tuesday, September 17, 1996 Mr. BEREUTER. Mr. Speaker, even as this administration points to successes in the area of foreign policy, we are watching those alleged successes unravel. The administration's policy toward Ireland has totally backfired and nearly precipitated a rupture of our relations with the United Kingdom. In Haiti, police who have been trained by this administration are now implicated in a series of political murders. The Middle East peace process has collapsed. The administration's policy toward Bosnia is even more troubling. The Clinton administration repeatedly has assured this body that United States troops would not remain in Bosnia beyond the December 20, 1996 termination point. But our troops in Europe are now receiving orders to spend 1997 in Bosnia, and U.N. Ambassador Albright is backtracking as fast as she can on the administration's promises to the American people. And the United States now finds itself standing up to Iraqi aggression by itself. The alliance put together by former President Bush is now in tatters, and the administration seems to lack the elementary competence to preserve our few remaining allies. One would assume the administration would first consult with Kuwait before announcing the deployment of thousands of troops to that country, but that seems beyond this administration's capability. Mr. Speaker, this Member would ask to insert into the Record an editorial from the September 17, 1996 edition of the Omaha World Herald entitled ``U.S. Involvement in Bosnia, Iraq Seems to Rely on Afterthoughts.'' As the editorial correctly notes, the current collapse of foreign policy is what happens when the voters elect a president who minimizes the importance of foreign policy expertise. This Member commends this insightful editorial to his colleagues. U.S. Involvement in Bosnia, Iraq Seems to Rely on Afterthoughts The foremost reasons that the Founders created the presidency was to give the country a head of state to command the armed forces and deal with other nations. The Clinton administration had not handled those responsibilities well, particularly in Bosnia and Iraq. President Clinton is reaping the harvest from his 1992 campaign slogan. ``It's the economy, stupid,'' which implied that George Bush's attention to foreign policy was a sign of detached elitism. The flaws in Clinton's approach are now showing. Certainly Bosnia had elections that were relatively free of violence. But U.S. troops were originally scheduled to leave Bosnia by Dec. 10. On Sunday, reporters asked Madeleine Albright the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and Secretary of State Warren Christopher whether the schedule will be met. They said it was too early to say. The U.N. mission will end Dec. 20, they said, but an international police force will still be needed. Neither would respond to questions about whether the United States would be part of that police force. Serbs, Muslims and Croats seem as polarized as ever. The peace that emerged from the Dayton negotiations is artificial. From all appearances, the combatants are biding their time until international troops get out of the way. Then the violence and ethnic cleansing will resume. The risk and expense of U.S. involvement will have been for nothing. Flaws are also evident in American policy in Iraq. It has now come to light that Americans running a Central Intelligence Agency operation in the northern Kurdish zone disappeared in the middle of the night when Saddam Hussein moved his forces into the region. Surprised Kurdish and Iraqi associates of the Americans were left to fend for themselves. By some reports. 100 of those U.S. cooperators were captured and executed. Apparently as an afterthought, the administration persuaded Turkey to accept some of the others. Afterthought--that seems to be the way the White House developed policy in the Persian Gulf. Hey, someone in the administration seems to have said late last week, let's send 5,000 troops to Kuwait to show that President Clinton means business. The plan was flashed around the world. But apparently no one bothered to inform Kuwait. The result was the spectacle of a tiny nation--one that depends on its friendship with the United States to protect itself against Saddam--keeping the secretary of defense waiting until Monday, when clearance for the troop buildup was finally granted. Other allies in the region have demonstrated reluctance to support U.S. moves against Saddam. Sen. John McCain and other critics of the administration said the administration failed to lay the necessary groundwork among friendly nations for such a mission. The administration also failed to inform Congress. Speaker Newt Gingrich has said that the situation in the Middle East is almost too muddled to help Clinton find a way out. Gingrich said the White House should back up, consult with the bipartisan leadership of Congress and meet with the gulf war allies in the Middle East to develop a coherent philosophy for dealing with Iraq. He said the United States must know before it acts that other nations will come to its support. Of course it must know. Gingrich's view is self-evident.

DOUG BEREUTER of nebraska in the house of representatives Tuesday, September 17, 1996 Mr. BEREUTER. Mr. Speaker, even as this administration points to successes in the area of foreign policy, we are watching those alleged successes unravel. The administration's policy toward Ireland has totally backfired and nearly precipitated a rupture of our relations with the United Kingdom. In Haiti, police who have been trained by this administration are now implicated in a series of political murders. The Middle East peace process has collapsed. The administration's policy toward Bosnia is even more troubling. The Clinton administration repeatedly has assured this body that United States troops would not remain in Bosnia beyond the December 20, 1996 termination point. But our troops in Europe are now receiving orders to spend 1997 in Bosnia, and U.N. Ambassador Albright is backtracking as fast as she can on the administration's promises to the American people. And the United States now finds itself standing up to Iraqi aggression by itself. The alliance put together by former President Bush is now in tatters, and the administration seems to lack the elementary competence to preserve our few remaining allies. One would assume the administration would first consult with Kuwait before announcing the deployment of thousands of troops to that country, but that seems beyond this administration's capability. Mr. Speaker, this Member would ask to insert into the Record an editorial from the September 17, 1996 edition of the Omaha World Herald entitled ``U.S. Involvement in Bosnia, Iraq Seems to Rely on Afterthoughts.'' As the editorial correctly notes, the current collapse of foreign policy is what happens when the voters elect a president who minimizes the importance of foreign policy expertise. This Member commends this insightful editorial to his colleagues. U.S. Involvement in Bosnia, Iraq Seems to Rely on Afterthoughts The foremost reasons that the Founders created the presidency was to give the country a head of state to command the armed forces and deal with other nations. The Clinton administration had not handled those responsibilities well, particularly in Bosnia and Iraq. President Clinton is reaping the harvest from his 1992 campaign slogan. ``It's the economy, stupid,'' which implied that George Bush's attention to foreign policy was a sign of detached elitism. The flaws in Clinton's approach are now showing. Certainly Bosnia had elections that were relatively free of violence. But U.S. troops were originally scheduled to leave Bosnia by Dec. 10. On Sunday, reporters asked Madeleine Albright the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and Secretary of State Warren Christopher whether the schedule will be met. They said it was too early to say. The U.N. mission will end Dec. 20, they said, but an international police force will still be needed. Neither would respond to questions about whether the United States would be part of that police force. Serbs, Muslims and Croats seem as polarized as ever. The peace that emerged from the Dayton negotiations is artificial. From all appearances, the combatants are biding their time until international troops get out of the way. Then the violence and ethnic cleansing will resume. The risk and expense of U.S. involvement will have been for nothing. Flaws are also evident in American policy in Iraq. It has now come to light that Americans running a Central Intelligence Agency operation in the northern Kurdish zone disappeared in the middle of the night when Saddam Hussein moved his forces into the region. Surprised Kurdish and Iraqi associates of the Americans were left to fend for themselves. By some reports. 100 of those U.S. cooperators were captured and executed. Apparently as an afterthought, the administration persuaded Turkey to accept some of the others. Afterthought--that seems to be the way the White House developed policy in the Persian Gulf. Hey, someone in the administration seems to have said late last week, let's send 5,000 troops to Kuwait to show that President Clinton means business. The plan was flashed around the world. But apparently no one bothered to inform Kuwait. The result was the spectacle of a tiny nation--one that depends on its friendship with the United States to protect itself against Saddam--keeping the secretary of defense waiting until Monday, when clearance for the troop buildup was finally granted. Other allies in the region have demonstrated reluctance to support U.S. moves against Saddam. Sen. John McCain and other critics of the administration said the administration failed to lay the necessary groundwork among friendly nations for such a mission. The administration also failed to inform Congress. Speaker Newt Gingrich has said that the situation in the Middle East is almost too muddled to help Clinton find a way out. Gingrich said the White House should back up, consult with the bipartisan leadership of Congress and meet with the gulf war allies in the Middle East to develop a coherent philosophy for dealing with Iraq. He said the United States must know before it acts that other nations will come to its support. Of course it must know. Gingrich's view is self-evident. The fact that the White House does things differently shows what can happen when the voters elect a president who minimizes the importance of foreign policy expertise. ","['HON.

40,"TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HONORABLE RON BROWN ______ speech of HON. NICK J. RAHALL II of west virginia in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 16, 1996 Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, people from all walks of life, professional, personal, religious--friends, colleagues and strangers alike--found themselves binding together over the past 2 weeks in mourning the loss of Ron Brown, U.S. Secretary of Commerce, who died tragically in a plane crash in Bosnia. As could be expected, Ron was lost to us while on a mission of peace as he sought to repair the fabric of war-torn Bosnia. Today, in honor of his memory, I would like to add my voice to those of hundreds of thousands--perhaps millions--of others who spoke of Ron Brown the man, the husband, the father, the friend of Democrats, the beloved advisor to President Clinton. I begin by extending my personal condolences to his wife, Alma and their children, and to the families and friends of all others who gave their lives as well, and to assure them that they are in my thoughts and my prayers; may they be comforted by God's love and the outpouring of grief, love, and the many tributes coming from people throughout the world. I also convey condolences to the family and friends of William Morton, a native of Huntington, WV, located in the district I represent, who was also aboard the doomed plane over Croatia. To them I extend my deepest sympathies and offer my prayers on their behalf that will always be comforted knowing that William died on a mission of peace, as a patriot of his country, doing the job he was committed to doing and doing well, at the side of his mentor, Secretary Brown. I pay particular tribute to Ron Brown, Secretary of Commerce, for while he excelled in all aspects of every endeavor or job or position he ever held in public life, it was as Secretary of Commerce that he won my everlasting admiration and esteem. As the Representative in the House of the people of the third district in West Virginia, one of my major goals is to do all that is possible to increase economic development opportunities and the job creation that follows such incentives, for my people. We live in the heart of Appalachia where unemployment in some areas still remains in double-digits, and where economic development is integral to our effort to create a stronger, stable economic base for all West Virginians. Ron Brown won my heart by requiring his entire department staff to memorize a one-sentence mission statement that ought to be the mission statement of every person in government, and that sentence was: ``Our mission is to ensure economic opportunity for every American.'' Ron Brown, having achieved the American dream for himself, spent the rest of his life seeking to make it a reality for those bound over by poverty and despair. His life stands as a testament to the power of educating our people, to a sound work ethic meaning a willingness to work hard, and a dedication of ourselves to work for the common good of all. In West Virginia, Ron will be remembered more for local economic development projects through the Economic Development Administration [EDA], and the Office of Economic Adjustment perhaps, then for his global view on trade initiatives between the United States and the rest of the world. He was a friend of towns and cities large and small throughout the Nation, and became the catalyst for change in social and economic circles that were long overdue, by reminding American capitalists that their prosperity was inextricably linked to the prosperity of all Americans. Whether Ron was in an American city, the Middle East, or Bosnia, he believed that participation in economic success would go a long way in healing racial, ethnic, and religious differences. Secretary Brown ran the Commerce Committee like no other Secretary before him--by actively involving businesses in securing jobs for Americans. He took a page from the investment strategy book of the Japanese Government whose economic growth excelled for many years because of the direct involvement of government in the Japanese business community, issuing a challenge to America's economic thinking. Ron Brown learned from that, and he acknowledged the power and importance of businesses great and small in the United States, and encouraged greater investment in business and industry, rather than ignoring them as his predecessors had done. Under his stewardship, the American economy rebounded over the past 3 years, largely due to his personal involvement and the involvement of his department staff who had memorized the one-sentence mission statement: ``Our mission is to ensure economic opportunity for every American.'' Ron Brown was many things to many people, and he was remembered as having great charisma, of being able to walk into a room and energize it, drawing people to his side. He was known for his sense of compassion, his willingness to listen to both sides. He was also known for his sense of humor and, needless to say, for his outstanding political acumen, and his ability to make friends anywhere and everywhere he went, working on behalf of the America he loved. That is Secretary Brown's legacy to us all, and we must not forget.

41,"COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF S. SGT. GERALD VON ALDRICH ______ HON. GLENN POSHARD of illinois in the house of representatives Wednesday, June 5, 1996 Mr. POSHARD. Mr. Speaker, tragedy never occurs softly. It has not been 2 months since that CT-43 airplane crashed on the outskirts of Dubrovnik, Croatia, simultaneously reintroducing us to all that is painful in this world, and all of its greatest promise. This was a national calamity, touching our highest leaders, reaching into every industry, every community, leaving an indelible imprint on the parchment that is our collective soul. Youth lost is painful. Youth lost in the service of a noble cause, while no less a shame, is at the same time liberating. By remembering those that are never to return is to give their lives meaning beyond their death. To hold their standard in front of us is the only fitting way to mourn their loss. It is the least we can do. While rarely as dramatic as death, life occurs with equal regularity. March 10, 1967 was no exception, bringing Gerald ``Jerry'' Aldrich II into this world. A large baby at 10 pounds, he had an equal appetite for knowledge. Jerry was reading by kindergarten and, auguring the future, was already disassembling and reassembling his train engines, just to see how they worked. A quiet yet thoughtful young man, he knew the sting of loss intimately. His father succumbed to cancer in the spring of 1983 while Jerry was still at North Clay High School. Two years later he graduated in the top 10 of his class, and bypassed a science scholarship to enlist in the U.S. Air Force where he was trained as an aircraft mechanic. ``Jake,'' as his military friends knew him, enjoyed his new career. He completed his initial training at Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio, TX, and soon moved to Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas. His next assignment took him to England. The year was 1991, and Jake served as the crew chief aboard an MC130E Combat Talon I aircraft out of Royal Air Force Base Alconbury. In July, Jake was promoted to staff sergeant. Germany was his next destination, first to Rhein-Main Base in Frankfort, and finally joining the 76th at Ramstein Base. While abroad, he courageously served in Operation Desert Storm. It was in Germany that Jake met his wife, Petra Shoemaker. They were married on January 11, 1991, in Germany, and also celebrated with an American ceremony that summer. This loving union was blessed with two sons, Timothy, three and Joshua, almost two. Jake was a devoted family man who spent every possible moment with his wife and children. They are joined in their grief by Jerry's mother, Hazel Wattles, of Louisville, brother, Mike Aldrich of Oak Harbor, WA, and sisters, Carolyn McKnelly and Sherry Roley of Effingham, IL, as well as the rest of his extended family. Mr. Speaker, words often sound hollow in the face of such gravity, but those of his sister, Sherry, resonate. She remembers that Jerry was able to lead a life full of opportunity and new experiences. He saw both good and bad, and met many influential people in the many countries he visited. Yet he remained a down to earth person who lived for his family, work, and country. As she reminds us, let us never forget the six Air Force crew members who gave their lives on this seemingly uneventful flight. Let us never forget any other service person who has fought for our country and the freedom it represents. S. Sgt. Gerald Aldrich was laid to rest on April 19, 1996. He had an Honor Guard military funeral with family members and friends present in Frankfurt, Germany. I charge us all to raise his standard high, so that we may remember not only the circumstances of his death, but a life valiantly lived. TRIBUTE TO COUNTRYSIDE POLICE CHIEF CHARLES D'URSO ON HIS 25 YEARS WITH THE DEPARTMENT ______ HON. WILLIAM O. LIPINSKI of illinois in the house of representatives Wednesday, June 5, 1996 Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I would like to pay tribute today to a dedicated police officer who has spent a quarter century protecting the lives and property of his fellow citizens, Chief Charles D'Urso of the Countryside, IL, Police Department. Chief D'Urso recently marked his 25th anniversary with the department. The term ``working his way up through the ranks'' is especially true in the chief's case: He started as a patrolman in late 1970, became a sergeant in 1980, made lieutenant in 1985, and was appointed chief in 1993. In Chief D'Urso's more than 25 years on the force, the department has gone from a one-room station to a state-of- the-art facility. Thanks in part to Chief D'Urso's leadership, the 27 police officers on the force are among the best trained and best equipped in the area. In addition to the chief's professional success, he is active in his community, serving on the executive board of the Countryside Rotary Club. He is also a past president of the fifth District Chief's of Police. Mr. Speaker, I salute Chief D'Urso on his 25 years as a police officer and wish him many more years of service to his community.

In Chief D'Urso's more than 25 years on the force, the department has gone from a one-room station to a state-of- the-art facility. Thanks in part to Chief D'Urso's leadership, the 27 police officers on the force are among the best trained and best equipped in the area. In addition to the chief's professional success, he is active in his community, serving on the executive board of the Countryside Rotary Club. He is also a past president of the fifth District Chief's of Police. Mr. Speaker, I salute Chief D'Urso on his 25 years as a police officer and wish him many more years of service to his community. ","['HON. GLENN ', 'POSHARD ', 'of illinois in the house of representatives Wednesday, June 5, 1996 ', 'Mr. POSHARD.', "" Mr. Speaker, tragedy never occurs softly. It has not been 2 months since that CT-43 airplane crashed on the outskirts of Dubrovnik, Croatia, simultaneously reintroducing us to all that is painful in this world, and all of its greatest promise. This was a national calamity, touching our highest leaders, reaching into every industry, every community, leaving an indelible imprint on the parchment that is our collective soul. Youth lost is painful. Youth lost in the service of a noble cause, while no less a shame, is at the same time liberating. By remembering those that are never to return is to give their lives meaning beyond their death. To hold their standard in front of us is the only fitting way to mourn their loss. It is the least we can do. While rarely as dramatic as death, life occurs with equal regularity. March 10, 1967 was no exception, bringing Gerald ``Jerry'' "", 'Aldrich II ', ""into this world. A large baby at 10 pounds, he had an equal appetite for knowledge. Jerry was reading by kindergarten and, auguring the future, was already disassembling and reassembling his train engines, just to see how they worked. A quiet yet thoughtful young man, he knew the sting of loss intimately. His father succumbed to cancer in the spring of 1983 while Jerry was still at North Clay High School. Two years later he graduated in the top 10 of his class, and bypassed a science scholarship to enlist in the U.S. Air Force where he was trained as an aircraft mechanic. ``Jake,'' as his military friends knew him, enjoyed his new career. He completed his initial training at Lackland Air Force Base near San "", 'Antonio, TX,', ' and soon moved to Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas. His next assignment took him to England. The year was 1991, and Jake served as the crew chief aboard an ', 'MC130E ', 'Combat ', 'Talon I ', ""aircraft out of Royal Air Force Base Alconbury. In July, Jake was promoted to staff sergeant. Germany was his next destination, first to Rhein-Main Base in Frankfort, and finally joining the 76th at Ramstein Base. While abroad, he courageously served in Operation Desert Storm. It was in Germany that Jake met his wife, Petra Shoemaker. They were married on January 11, 1991, in Germany, and also celebrated with an American ceremony that summer. This loving union was blessed with two sons, Timothy, three and Joshua, almost two. Jake was a devoted family man who spent every possible moment with his wife and children. They are joined in their grief by Jerry's mother, Hazel Wattles, of Louisville, brother, Mike Aldrich of Oak "", 'Harbor, WA,', ' and sisters, Carolyn McKnelly and Sherry Roley of ', 'Effingham, IL,', ' as well as the rest of his extended family. Mr. Speaker, words often sound hollow in the face of such gravity, but those of his sister, Sherry, resonate. She remembers that Jerry was able to lead a life full of opportunity and new experiences. He saw both good and bad, and met many influential people in the many countries he visited. Yet he remained a down to earth person who lived for his family, work, and country. As she reminds us, let us never forget the six Air Force crew members who gave their lives on this seemingly uneventful flight. Let us never forget any other service person who has fought for our country and the freedom it represents. S. Sgt. Gerald Aldrich was laid to rest on April 19, 1996. He had an Honor Guard military funeral with family members and friends present in Frankfurt, ', 'Germany.

42,"BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I believe we are closer to a balanced budget than we have been in many years. I think the public overwhelmingly wants a balanced budget. I think we are moving in that direction. But there are little problems here and there that seem to prevent us from getting together in being able to shake hands on a balanced budget. The President and the Republican leadership I think all realize that we need a balanced budget for it will certainly directly affect virtually every segment of the Government and every citizen of the country. I feel that lost in the political rhetoric over the budget is the fact that we have reached substantial agreements at this stage. We have agreed that the budget ought to be balanced in 7 years. We have agreed that CBO figures ought be controlling. We have agreed that there ought to be less Government. We have agreed that there ought to be a tax cut. And while both sides still have some major differences to work out, I feel that good-faith negotiations on these issues can yield a budget that is fair and equitable to all segments of society, and each party can claim victory. When the recess occurred, there was a statement to the effect that we were going to stop the negotiations and then come back again. There have been three or four efforts that have been made recently to try to get the parties together to start negotiating again. But for some reason or other they have been called off. Now that the recess is over, and the recess from the negotiations is over, it is time to begin again and for each side to meet and come to an agreement. The longer the negotiators avoid constructive negotiations the greater the chances for each side to become reentrenched in their policy positions. Compromise is an art that appears to have somehow been forgotten. It is apparent that in order for an agreement to be reached, both Democrats and Republicans are going to have to give and take. Each side is going to have to have some wins and each side is going to have to have some losses. If the Israelis and the Palestinians can get together and negotiate in good faith, there is no reason why the Democrats and the Republicans cannot do likewise. If the Croats, Moslems, and Serbs can agree on a cease-fire, why cannot both parties put their verbal pistols back in their holsters? I do not know exactly what the solution is. But it may well be that we may have to go to Camp David and tell them to stay there until they reach an agreement. Maybe Dayton is the place. Maybe Norway. But whatever it takes in regards to getting together and finding a location and staying with it until we reach an agreement, it seems to me to be the proper course to follow. When you add it up, the current Democratic proposals and the Republican proposals are less than $100 billion apart. Taking into account $12 trillion over a 7-year period, this figure amounts to less than .8 of 1 percent. With this in mind, it seems to me that the negotiations should proceed with an emphasis on what each side is willing to give and take in order to reach a long overdue budget agreement. The State of the Union Address will have a significant impact on the negotiations. It is a good opportunity for the President to demonstrate his willingness to reach an accord. However, if his speech is overly partisan, it can harm the negotiating atmosphere by having a hardening effect on the Republican negotiators. Likewise, the Republican response can also either help or hurt the negotiating process. Hopefully, the President will extend a hand of conciliation, and if he does, I hope the Republicans will not slap it, but instead shake it. I hope that each Senator will keep this in mind when determining exactly what he or she wants to convey, when commenting on the content of the President's speech. Each Senator must be aware that their responses may affect the overall negotiations pertaining to the budget. We need to adopt a continuing resolution--hopefully a clean one--by January 26. The expiration of the current continuing resolution, of course, runs out on that date. Despite all the heated rhetoric, I do not believe it is in the best interest of our citizens to have the remaining portion of Government closed down. A great number of the various Agencies and Departments will stay open under the legislation that has already been adopted. Taxpayers and Federal employees should not be punished, because Congress and the administration have not fulfilled their obligation to reach a budget. Mr. President, as I have stated before, I think it is imperative that we reach an agreement on the budget, and I am optimistic that when reasonable people sit down together an agreement can be worked out. It seems to me we have made a great deal of progress. We have agreed on some fundamentals: A 7-year period for a balanced budget; CBO figures; a tax cut; and a cut in Government. We just need to get together. Perhaps we need a mediator. But I hope that we will let reason prevail, and we will not let this opportunity pass to achieve a balanced budget.

43,"BOSNIA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Funderburk] is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. FUNDERBURK. Mr. Speaker, I am here to talk about the tragedy of American troops being sent to Bosnia and the fact that the President has made a decision without consulting with the American people and without consulting with Congress. {time} 1515 We are here for a purpose in the People's House. We were elected to represent the people. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution gives the Congress the authority and the power to raise funds for armies and for the Navy. The President, like he did with the Mexican bailout, has simply gone around the Congress and tried to circumvent us in this action. It is obvious from the polls taken around the country, and it is obvious from the people who call into our office every day, that there is very little support for the President's action, yet he has gone ahead without the support of the people and without the support of the Congress, and I think there is a tragedy in the making. Personality I lived 6 years of my life in the Balkans. I was a United States Ambassador to Romania, which borders Yugoslavia. I traveled over into Yugoslavia, and the terrain in that area is mountainous. Winter is coming in the Balkans at this time. We have got tanks over there that are going to be messed up in the mush and the slog of winter. There are millions of land mines that have been planted by the Bosnia Serbs, and Croats, and Moslems. And the President said he is sending American troops over there to keep the peace, and that we are going to impose and we are going to bring about a peace, and we are going to stop the genocide of these people. Well, if we go everywhere in the world simply because people ware fighting and killing each other, we could be in Sudan, we could be in Northern Ireland, we could be in Afghanistan, we could be all over the world. This is an absurdity. In 1386 they had a famous battle, the Battle of the Blackbirds in the former Serbia and Yugoslavia, and that is when the Serbs lost, and the Ottoman Turks came in, and they won, and many of the people converted or were forced to convert to Islam. Today the Serbs, who are Orthodox Christians, are still upset and they are still seeking revenge, and they are still fighting against those who became Moslems. So you see you have an ethnic strife that has been going on for 600 years, and we are supposed to send troops over there for 1 year, let them stand in place, get killed by land mines, get killed by radical Arab terrorists who are in the area, and then we exit after 1 year supposedly, and we will have established peace that has not been there for 600 years. Come on, Mr. President, give me a break, get real. The cost in lives to America is something that we ought to be very careful about, and the cost in dollars. First of all, the President said he was only going to send 20,000 troops. That is what he told the American people. Now it is up to 37,000 troops. First he said it is only going to cost us $2 billion. Now it is up to $4 billion. I mean we are up here to balance the budget, we are here to reduce the deficit, we are here to cut costs, and the President is getting money for a Mexican bailout, $25 billion out of a slush fund. Now he wants to send $4 billion, probably much more, to Bosnia, a place that is an artificial creation, it is not a member of NATO. We have NATO set up to defend members of NATO against the Soviet threat. What happened to the Soviet threat? So he said we have got to save NATO by going to Bosnia. Are you ready for this? The President backed last week the Foreign Minister of Spain, Spain is not even part of the military aspect of NATO, he backed the Foreign Minister, Javier Solana, to be the new NATO military commander. Well, this is an anti-NATO guy who is a member of the Socialist Worker's Party, tried to establish communism in Spain, one of Fidel Castro's best friends. Now he is the head of NATO. We want to go save NATO under the NATO military command of Javier Solana. Give me a break. [[Page H 14208]] The President apparently has pollsters who have told him, ``What you've got to do is establish some leadership credentials, so go over there, and look presidential, act like command in chief, and the people will reward you for it.'' Not only that, they told him something, and if this is the way he is operating, and this is truly what is behind this, this is a very cynical way to manipulate the American people and to perhaps bring about the loss of lives and a lot of dollars.

Come on, Mr. President, give me a break, get real. The cost in lives to America is something that we ought to be very careful about, and the cost in dollars. First of all, the President said he was only going to send 20,000 troops. That is what he told the American people. Now it is up to 37,000 troops. First he said it is only going to cost us $2 billion. Now it is up to $4 billion. I mean we are up here to balance the budget, we are here to reduce the deficit, we are here to cut costs, and the President is getting money for a Mexican bailout, $25 billion out of a slush fund. Now he wants to send $4 billion, probably much more, to Bosnia, a place that is an artificial creation, it is not a member of ', 'NATO.', ' We have ', 'NATO ', 'set up to defend members of ', 'NATO ', 'against the Soviet threat. What happened to the Soviet threat? So he said we have got to save ', 'NATO ', 'by going to Bosnia. Are you ready for this? The President backed last week the Foreign Minister of Spain, Spain is not even part of the military aspect of ', 'NATO,', ' he backed the Foreign Minister, Javier Solana, to be the new ', 'NATO ', 'military commander. Well, this is an anti-', 'NATO ', ""guy who is a member of the Socialist Worker's Party, tried to establish communism in Spain, one of Fidel Castro's best friends. Now he is the head of "", 'NATO.', ' We want to go save ', 'NATO ', 'under the ', 'NATO ', 'military command of Javier Solana. Give me a break. [[', 'Page H ', ""14208]] The President apparently has pollsters who have told him, ``What you've got to do is establish some leadership credentials, so go over there, and look presidential, act like command in chief, and the people will reward you for it.'' Not only that, they told him something, and if this is the way he is operating, and this is truly what is behind this, this is a very cynical way to manipulate the American people and to perhaps bring about the loss of lives and a lot of dollars. They said, you know, ``It doesn't matter if the American people are opposed to this action, it does not matter if Congress is opposed to it. You put the troops in the field, and they will be forced to do the loyal thing and say they support the American troops.'' That is the box he is putting us in, and I think he is making a tragic mistake, and I wish he would reconsider. ""]"
44,"THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND AND BALANCING THE BUDGET Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. Taylor] raised the issue of whether there is, in fact, a Balanced Budget Act before us. I had spoken about the fact that, and I say ``the fact'' that the budget proposed by the majority, by the Republican majority, by Speaker Gingrich, is going to take $636 billion from the Social Security trust fund in order to so-call balance the budget. I want to quote at this point, so it is not just coming from me, but from Senator Hollings in the other body: You will expend another $636 billion of the Social Security trust fund. We said we were raising the Social Security taxes to make certain there was trust in the trust fund through the year 2050. That is why the FICA taxes, your Social Security tax, was raised previously, to make sure the trust fund was solvent. Now we are taking it. Again, quoting Senator Hollings: When you put together the borrowing from the trust funds that must be replenished, you get the real deficit, the gross Federal deficit, and the gross interest costs. Finally, again from Senator Hollings: Wait a minute. When you take the revenues in, the outlays out, and you look at [[Page H 13773]] that figure, that is too high for me to run on in the next election, so we will take an amount of money out of the right pocket, put it into the left pocket, we will take $636 billion from Social Security in this budget that we have under consideration, and put it in the general fund to make it appear we are balancing the budget. You will have to pay back Social Security with interest and at the end of the 7-year budget period, you will owe. At the end of the 7-year period, we will all have to pay back supposedly over $1 trillion into the Social Security trust fund, and no one has any idea, not any Senator or House Member, who is going to introduce the increase in taxes to refund the Social Security trust fund. Mr. Speaker, I wish the Speaker would come here and answer that question. Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, it came as quite a surprise to me yesterday in researching the Republican budget plan that was much touted on the floor of this House as being the balanced budget plan of 1995, said repeatedly, that the annual operating deficit for this Nation will actually increase by $33 billion in fiscal year 1996 over this year. I think people need to know that. The budget deficit will increase from $263 billion on an annual operating basis to $296 billion on an annual operating basis. Part of this, Mr. Speaker, will come from the trust funds that the gentleman from Hawaii [Mr. Abercrombie] just mentioned: The $118 billion that people paid into things like the Social Security trust fund will be used to disguise the true nature of this debt. The gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Kasich] is for a balanced budget. I am for a balanced budget. Let us be honest with the American people. Let us not tell them we can spend more in spending, we can receive less in taxes, that we are already $5 trillion in debt, paying $1 million in interest payments every 2 minutes, 2 minutes, and somehow all of this is magically going to work without pain. The gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Kasich] is my friend, but let us be honest with this. Let us be honest with the American people. This morning you told me you were willing to borrow $75 billion so you could give people a minuscule tax break. They have to pay that back. That is not a gift. That is just loan sharking. You are taking money from them, you are giving them a little bit back, and they are going to have to pay back a whole heck of a lot more of the time they pay the interest. Let us be honest with the American people. The second thing I want to mention, Mr. Speaker, is I have had a number of calls from home. I want to assure the people of south Mississippi that I was one of the first members of this body to be against putting American troops on the ground when President Bush asked me to do it, and I will remain opposed to that when President Clinton asks me to do it. I traveled to that part of the world a few weeks ago, traveled up to the border posts in Macedonia, had the privilege with having lunch with some fellow Mississippians, a young man from Tupelo in particular, and from four-star officers to sergeant majors. Every one of them privately told me we should not get involved there. That is not our fight. These people have been fighting each other for 700 years. The only peace they have known recently was the 45 or so years when Tito was in charge there, using the iron fist of communism, and he got the Bosnians to quit killing Muslims and the Muslims to quit killing Serbs and the Croatians to quit killing the others. As soon as the iron fist of communism was gone, they went back to killing each other. Mr. Speaker, I want to close by saying that they told me that the smart weapons that worked so well in Desert Storm will not work in the cold, wet fog of Bosnia. We are going to send those kids on the ground, a bunch of them are going to die, and nothing good will come of it.

45,"BOSNIA, MEDICARE, AND THE BUDGET The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Chrysler). Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Kingston] is recognized for 60 minutes. [[Page H 13711]] Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, having just returned from a series of meetings in Georgia and meeting with a number of constituents during the work recess period, there are three predominant things that people have on their minds back home, and I think this is probably true all over America, and that is Bosnia, Medicare, and the budget. I would like to speak very briefly on Bosnia, because we are now in a new phase where the President, our Commander in Chief, has officially decided to embark in a new phase of the debate by sending and committing to send 20,000 of our troops over there. We all want to support troops who are anywhere fighting in the world at the order of the Commander in Chief, and yet certainly in Bosnia we have a lot of questions. The questions that we had debated 2 weeks ago when we had a very critical vote on Bosnia, which in that vote Congress decided against sending troops over there, and our questions were at the time: What is our peril? What is the timetable that we will be there? What is the plan? Who are our allies? How long will we be there? How will we get out of being there? And what is the exact mission? These questions need to be answered. I think within the next couple of weeks the President will be answering these through his staff members to Congress. Senate hearings, I believe, began today, Mr. Speaker. So I think it is appropriate that we look at this and continue this debate. Mr. Speaker, as the previous speaker, the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Ramstad] said, clearly the people of America at this point are not in support of sending troops to Bosnia; and I think, because of that, we need to define what the American peril is, and I have yet to hear what that peril is. It is very important for us to know before we send our sons and daughters over there. Mr. Speaker, I was in Italy in August and had the opportunity to be briefed by NATO on the Bosnian situation. In August, when one talked about Bosnia, it was years and years away in terms of everything that has happened; and yet, in that discussion, one of the things that struck me was who are our allies. It is not just Bosnians and Croatians and Serbians. There are all kinds of subgroups and countergroups and local warloads and so forth. I know often when we try to take humanitarian supplies into one section another group down the road or up the road from them would block the supply trucks, even though they all had the same label as being Bosnians. Yet they were different, because they were from a different territory. So one of my main questions is going to be that I hope to find out in the next couple of weeks who will our allies be. Then a question that has come up more and more lately as we debate balancing the budget is what is this going to cost us? Will we really be able to get out of there in a year or is it going to be like so many other peaces that we have won worldwide? The peace that we got in Somalia, the peace that we got in Haiti, the peace that we got anywhere is really purchased peace. It is a matter of the United States of America pulling out the checkbook and buying off the warring factions. I would like to know what those costs are. I know our taxpayers back home would like to know also. Mr. Speaker, we are going to have debates and we are going to have hearings, and this is a good process. The War Powers Act has been debated since the inception of our great democracy, and yet the Congress and the President still view these things differently. Again, we do want to support the troops individually. It looks like at this point they are going to go over there, yet at the same time we have congressional duties of our own and we will begin immediately in due diligence to answer some of the questions that we have been asking on the floor of the House. Mr. Speaker, on Medicare let me just say this. The gentleman from Connecticut [Mr. Shays], who is the budget expert, is down here. Our colleague, the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Mrs. Johnson] was able to come to Savannah this weekend and found the time to meet with a lot of our hospitals and nursing homes and home health care professionals and other health care providers, and we talked about the fact that in April the Medicare trustees said Medicare is going to run out of money in 2 years, it will be bankrupt in 6 years; it is the obligation and duty of the Congress to act to preserve and protect Medicare, which we have been doing. We are trying to slow down the inflation rate of Medicare, the growth of it. It is right now at about 11 percent; regular medical inflation is more in the 4 to 6 percent range. We believe if we can get Medicare costs in that 4 to 6 percent range, we can save it. Yet at the same time, we are committed to increased spending per recipient from $4,800 to $6,700. As I said that to the people back home, they said, well, that is not a cut. We said, well, yes, it is true. We are going from about $178 billion to $278 billion. Mr. Speaker, let me yield back the balance of my time, and maybe the gentleman from Connecticut [Mr. Shays] would yield a few minutes to me to complete that thought.

Our colleague, the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Mrs. Johnson] was able to come to Savannah this weekend and found the time to meet with a lot of our hospitals and nursing homes and home health care professionals and other health care providers, and we talked about the fact that in April the Medicare trustees said Medicare is going to run out of money in 2 years, it will be bankrupt in 6 years; it is the obligation and duty of the Congress to act to preserve and protect Medicare, which we have been doing. We are trying to slow down the inflation rate of Medicare, the growth of it. It is right now at about 11 percent; regular medical inflation is more in the 4 to 6 percent range. We believe if we can get Medicare costs in that 4 to 6 percent range, we can save it. Yet at the same time, we are committed to increased spending per recipient from $4,800 to $6,700. ', 'As I ', 'said that to the people back home, they said, well, that is not a cut. We said, well, yes, it is true. We are going from about $178 billion to $278 billion. Mr. Speaker, let me yield back the balance of my time, and maybe the gentleman from Connecticut [Mr. Shays] would yield a few minutes to me to complete that thought. ']"
46,"THE DEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES MILITARY FORCES TO IMPLEMENT THE BOSNIA PEACE AGREEMENT Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, last week, the Senate Armed Services Committee conducted a hearing with national security, foreign policy and intelligence experts, who were all former executive branch officials under Presidents Bush, Reagan, and Carter. All three witnesses supported deploying United States military forces to Bosnia to implement the peace plan because they believe it is critical to preserve the credibility and reliability of the United States as a world leader and as a member of the North Atlantic Alliance. While the three witnesses endorsed the deployment of U.S. military forces to implement the agreement, they also highlighted their concerns about the likelihood of disaster and questioned the ability of the implementation force to achieve any meaningful mission objectives. In fact, the witnesses all agreed that the best that could be hoped for would be to sustain the ceasefire for the time period that NATO forces are in the region. Last week, the President traveled to Europe to visit with our allies, and speak with the young men and women of the 1st Armored Division stationed in Germany who are to be deployed to Bosnia very shortly. One Sunday, President Clinton was briefed on the NATO implementation plan, and gave his conditional approval to the concept. Following that conditional approval, the President authorized the deployment of around 700 United States troops who will lay the goundwork for the arrival of the main body of the NATO Implementation Forces, who will deploy to Bosnia once the peace agreement is formally signed in Paris next week. President Clinton spoke to the troops, informing them of the United States national interests that warrant their deployment to Bosnia to enforce the peace agreement. The President assured the troops that their mission is clear, limited and achievable and that the risks to their safety will be minimized. According to the director for strategic plans and policy in the office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Wes Clark, all U.S. forces should be in the region within 30 days of the formal signing of the agreement in Paris on December 14. According to the Department of Defense, the overall concept of the mission of the implementation force will be to monitor and enforce compliance with the military aspects of the Dayton peace agreement. The military tasks of the Dayton agreement include: Supervise the ceasefire lines and zones of separation; monitor, and if necessary enforce the withdrawal of forces to their respective territories within the agreed time periods; establish and man the 4-kilometer zone of separation; establish liaison with local military and civilian authorities; and create joint military commissions to resolve disputes between the parties. All implementation forces, NATO and non-NATO, will operate under NATO rules of engagement. Those rules of engagement will permit the right to use force up to and including deadly force for self-defense to protect against hostile acts or hostile intentions, and, in order to accomplish the mission. Despite a briefing by the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as congressional hearings this past week with administration officials, I continue to have grave concerns and questions about the clarify of the mission, and whether the goals and objectives of the mission can be achieved within the limited deployment framework. I know that our young military men and women are well-trained, the best equipped in the world and ready to go. What I am most concerned about is whether all their training and equipment will have prepared them for the sniper fire, the landmines, the terrible terrain and weather in which they will have to live. I am also concerned about possible kidnapings that could occur and how our troops will be treated. Will they be treated as prisoners of war, or political or legal detainees. In 1945, United States military forces were sent into to an area near Tuzla to keep Yugoslavian partisan out of Trieste. We were not officially at war, but the partisans resented the presence of the U.S. forces and ambushed U.S. patrols and aircraft with sniper fire, landmines, and booby traps. It took 9 years for an agreement to be reached before the 1 year mission was completed and U.S. forces came home. Mr. President, there are already signs of dissensions among the parties to the agreement. The Serbs continue to press for a renegotiation because the agreement would require Sarajevo to come under control of the Moslem-Croat federation and Serbian civilians feel they will not be protected. Our French allies have raised concerns that their troops could become trapped if there is renewed fighting. Additionally, the United States is being viewed as being partial to the Bosnians as a result of their support and there is a feeling that United States military forces will not be impartial. As I stated earlier, in statements on the floor and in hearings, I continue to have grave concerns about the vital interests that have lead the President to commit U.S. military forces to implement this peace agreement. I am not yet convinced that we have a vital national interest in Bosnia that requires the deployment of United States military forces, or that our national security interests are being threatened. On Wednesday, Secretary of Defense Perry, Assistant Secretary Holbrooke and General Shalikashvili will appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee. I intend to ask more questions about the mission, objectives of the mission and the timeframe, the exit strategy; why it is necessary to have over 60,000 heavily armed military forces with armored vehicles as peacekeepers; how the implementation forces will separate the opposing forces; and how the U.S. military forces will avoid taking on nonmilitary tasks, when it appears that the civilian humanitarian services and operations will take at least 6 months to begin operation. Mr. President, I do not intend to rubberstamp a commitment by the President. I will reserve final judgement until after the hearings have taken place, and then make a final decision. I yield the floor.

47,"THE USE OF TROOPS IN BOSNIA Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to explain why I reluctantly supported last night the resolution written by Majority Leader Dole and Senator McCain of Arizona, which authorized the use of American troops to implement the Dayton Framework Agreement. I did so with some apprehension. I have no illusions about how difficult this mission could be. Bosnia is a country deeply divided by 4 years of warfare and centuries of turbulence. The terrain is rough and the weather fierce. Much of the land is sown with mines. So why do I--with some apprehension--support the Dole resolution? I do it because I believe implementing the Dayton Agreement is the best option in a very bad situation. Our decision would be easier if we could roll back the clock. If President Bush had used air power to punish Serbian aggression in 1991, we might not be here today. If President Clinton had persuaded our allies, over the past 2 years, to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia, we might now have the balance of power in Bosnia that the Dayton Agreement seeks to create. That is why I voted to lift the arms embargo so that Bosnia could defend itself. But we cannot roll back the clock; 4 years of war have passed, and the parties are now exhausted. Our allies opposed lifting the embargo. So President Clinton began a diplomatic campaign this past summer to broker a peace settlement. The President's leadership and American-led NATO air strikes produced the Dayton Agreement. President Clinton deserves congratulations for this historic achievement. Last night the Senate had to decide whether to authorize the use of troops to implement that agreement. Many North Dakotans have shared their concerns about this mission with me. So I want to take a moment to explain my vote to them by describing the decision that the Senate faced and the Dole resolution. Let me put my vote in the context of what is happening in Bosnia. Since the war began, 250,000 people have lost their lives. Two million people have become homeless. Innocent civilians have been slaughtered, and no one has been spared--not the young, not the infirm, not the elderly. Ethnic cleansing has raged across the land of Bosnia. Atrocities have been committed, by both sides. And we have reliable reports of horrors that we thought we had banished from Europe 50 years ago, such as concentration camps and mass graves. I agree with Senator Dole's assesment that the President has the constitutional authority to commit these troops for a peacekeeping mission. While I have serious reservations about it, it seems to me we ought to, as the President commits these troops, by resolution, support the troops themselves and create narrow restrictions under which the President can keep them there--that they are going only in a peacekeeping role. The President argues that other countries are sending more troops per capita than we are to carry out this mission. He points out that England is sending three times as many troops, relative to their population, as we are. I understand why it was difficult for the President to withhold a commitment of American troops to keep a peace that he helped negotiate and to keep a peace that will be monitored by virtually all other countries that belong to NATO. But that does not eliminate the deep reservations I have about the risks of this mission, and about the dangers of changing the mission once our troops are in place in Bosnia. It is true, I believe, that America is looked upon as a world leader that is not seeking to gain territory but is helping to promote peace. It is also true that with that leadership comes responsibilities. But our country has, in so many ways, for so many years, had to bear the brunt of that responsibility--to pay for the defense of Western Europe and to provide international leadership when others would not. I would have much preferred, in this circumstance, that the European Community would have been willing to step forward and broker a peace and keep the peace without having the United States expose our ground troops to the kind of risks we will face in the Balkan region. But the President has committed our country to helping to secure peace. And it seems to me we are in a position now where we must tell the President these are the conditions under which you can meet that commitment, which is what the Dole resolution attempts to do. I am not, by supporting the Dole resolution, saying that I believe the President made the right commitment for our country. But rather, I am expressing support for the troops, acknowledging that the commitment was made and saying that our country must now proceed to keep its word. Because I have real concerns about this mission I want the President and my colleagues to know that if a change of mission occurs in Bosnia, if the peace does not hold, and there is a decision our soldiers should become peacemakers instead of peacekeepers then I will be among the first in Congress to call for the immediate withdrawal of the American troops and to vote for a cut-off of funding, if necessary, to accomplish that withdrawal. Finally, Mr. President, let me highlight a few aspects of the Dole resolution that I think are important to my vote. First, the resolution expresses the unequivocal support of Congress for the work of our troops. It commends their professionalism, their bravery, and their sacrifice. It expresses the commitment of Congress to give them the tools they will need to do their job. Second, it states that the United States will lead an international effort to arm and train the Bosnian Moslems. That is important. American troops will be able to leave if the Bosnian Moslems are able to defend themselves. Third, the Dole resolution recognizes that American troops are going to Bosnia to enforce a peace agreement. They are not there to make the peace. The leaders of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia have decided that peace is their policy, and they have again attested to that decision by signing an agreement today in Paris. If the parties themselves abandon peace, then our troops should depart. Fourth, the resolution supports a truly multilateral operation. The Dayton Agreement's implementation force will be composed of 60,000 troops from about 30 different countries, including non-NATO nations such as Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. This is my thinking on Bosnia, Mr. President, and these are the reasons why I voted for the Dole resolution last night. I hope and pray that my vote will help our troops fulfill their mission and will help speed them safely home.

', 'Because I ', ""have real concerns about this mission I want the President and my colleagues to know that if a change of mission occurs in Bosnia, if the peace does not hold, and there is a decision our soldiers should become peacemakers instead of peacekeepers then I will be among the first in Congress to call for the immediate withdrawal of the American troops and to vote for a cut-off of funding, if necessary, to accomplish that withdrawal. Finally, Mr. President, let me highlight a few aspects of the Dole resolution that I think are important to my vote. First, the resolution expresses the unequivocal support of Congress for the work of our troops. It commends their professionalism, their bravery, and their sacrifice. It expresses the commitment of Congress to give them the tools they will need to do their job. Second, it states that the United States will lead an international effort to arm and train the Bosnian Moslems. That is important. American troops will be able to leave if the Bosnian Moslems are able to defend themselves. Third, the Dole resolution recognizes that American troops are going to Bosnia to enforce a peace agreement. They are not there to make the peace. The leaders of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia have decided that peace is their policy, and they have again attested to that decision by signing an agreement today in Paris. If the parties themselves abandon peace, then our troops should depart. Fourth, the resolution supports a truly multilateral operation. The Dayton Agreement's implementation force will be composed of 60,000 troops from about 30 different countries, including non-"", 'NATO ', 'nations such as Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. This is my thinking on Bosnia, Mr. President, and these are the reasons why I voted for the Dole resolution last night. I hope and pray that my vote will help our troops fulfill their mission and will help speed them safely home. ']"
48,"A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST LANDMINES Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier today, Save the Children, the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, and others joined together to launch a national campaign to ban the production, use, and transfer of antipersonnel landmines. They spoke of a 2-week conference that has just ended--actually, more than a conference, a gathering of nations--in Vienna, Austria, to reach agreement on ways to stop the killing and maiming of civilians by these indiscriminate weapons. At that conference in Vienna, officials from governments from around the world, including our own, made speeches about how terrible landmines are. Many of them spoke of the fact that there are 100 million unexploded landmines in over 60 countries, and every day, every 22 minutes, somebody--often a child--is killed or maimed by these landmines. That is 72 people every day of every week of the year. They went on to say how much they all wanted to get rid of them, but. They each had an exception or loophole so their landmines, or their manner of using them, would not be affected. President Clinton gave a stirring speech at the United Nations last year, where he called for the eventual elimination of antipersonnel landmines. That was an historic milestone. But in Vienna last week, the United States lagged behind several countries, including several of our NATO allies. While Belgium outlawed landmines and Austria renounced their use and France announced that it would no longer produce them, the United States continued to resist these kinds of dramatic steps. At least the U.S. Senate, a body that can and should be the conscience of the Nation, voted by a two-thirds majority to impose a 1- year moratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines and to continue our moratorium on the export of landmines. We here in the U.S. Senate took a leadership position that has been applauded around the world. Editorials around the world have said how far reaching we were. A number of countries have even gone farther. Why did Belgium, a country that sends people for peacekeeping missions all the time, ban the use of antipersonnel landmines by its own forces? Because when Belgium sends peacekeepers, even after the fighting has stopped and the guns have been withdrawn, there is one killer that remains behind--the millions of antipersonnel landmines, each one waiting for a peacekeeper or a nurse or a missionary to step on a pile of leaves or some grass or a road or walk by a watering hole and suddenly lose their leg or their arm or their life. The same happens when a child picks up a shiny object thinking it is a toy and loses his or her hands or face or eyes or life. That happens every few minutes in the 60-odd countries that are infested with unexploded landmines. Mr. President, much could be done if the United States had the courage to adopt as its official policy the moratorium passed by the U.S. Senate, Republicans and Democrats, some of the most conservative and some of the most liberal. It was a vote that spanned the political spectrum. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer who voted for that. It is no denigration of any of us that we have differences in political philosophy. We come from different parts of the country and different parties. But we approach this issue with the same humanitarian sense. This is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. The distinguished Presiding Officer knows from his past experience in the past administration--he knows how volunteers from this country, carrying out the highest ideals of this country, volunteers in the Peace Corps, go to countries like Ethiopia, and Nicaragua, and perhaps even Bosnia someday. What is one of the biggest dangers they face? It is not malaria, it is not dysentery, although those diseases are there. It is that when they go into a village to help somebody plant a new variety of corn or wheat or help build an irrigation system or teach a group of children how to play baseball, they may not come back alive because of landmines, probably left there by people who were fighting years ago. But the landmines remain. I hope our country will take more of a lead, that we will start catching up with some of our NATO allies and others who have experienced firsthand the devastation these insidious weapons cause. I expect we are going to send troops to Bosnia, to fulfill our commitments to NATO. At a meeting of the bipartisan congressional leadership with the President and his Cabinet the other day I said, ``If we do send Americans into Bosnia, into the former Yugoslavia, Mr. President, I hope you will do one thing. I hope you will tell the American people that this is not a risk-free operation. That even if there is a cease-fire, even if there is a cease-fire that holds, the men and women we send in there will face one very grave danger--from landmines. Some estimate over 1.5 million landmines are strewn in Bosnia alone.'' I learned today that there are another 2 million in Croatia. We need to tell the American people that their sons and daughters may not be shot by one of the warring sides in the former Yugoslavia, but they may be injured or killed tragically by a landmine left behind. And it is quite possible we will not even know which side put it there. These are the Saturday night specials of civil wars and guerrilla warfare. So, I applaud those who came together today to renew a national debate on banning landmines. I thank my colleagues here in the Senate who joined to vote for a moratorium on their use. I commend the President for the position he has taken, as far as it has gone. I commend the Secretary of State, UN Ambassador Albright and others who have also, but I urge the administration to redouble its efforts. Only strong leadership, by the world's only superpower, will suffice. Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

49,"ENGLISH AS THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE ______ HON. THOMAS M. BARRETT of wisconsin in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 25, 1996 Mr. BARRETT of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues an article by John Gurda, an excellent author and historian in Milwaukee. The article appeared in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel earlier this year. This article takes an intriguing look at the issue of English as the official language of the United States. It reminds us that most of us have ancestry which stems from outside the United States. It is with this in mind that I provide the following article. [From the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Apr. 1, 1996] How Soon the ``English First'' Crowd Forgets (By John Gurda) Their names are Seratti, Skindrud, Zukowski, Ziegelbauer, Gunderson, Goetsch, Buettner, Huebsch and Drzewiecki. They represent some of Wisconsin's leading ethnic groups--German, Norwegian, Polish and Italian--and it is a safe bet that none of their ancestors spoke a word of English when they arrived. The irony is that the names belong to state legislators who are sponsoring the ``English First'' bill. Their measure would establish English as the ``official language of Wisconsin'' and would, with a few carefully worded exceptions, prohibit the use of other languages in ``all written expression'' by any unit of state or local government. It seems puzzling, at first, that the bill would get a serious hearing in a state as ethnic as Wisconsin. It seems even stranger that elected officials would deny some current residents a privilege that their own ancestors enjoyed: the right to be addressed in their native tongues. Linguistic diversity, officially endorsed, is older than the state. When Solomon Juneau became Milwaukee's first mayor in 1846, 1,000 copies of his inaugural address were printed-- 500 in English and 500 in German. The same policy was observed when Wisconsin adopted a constitution two years later. In the 1850s and '60s, the state published guidebooks in German, Norwegian, French, Dutch and Swedish, as well as in English, hoping to attract newcomers from Europe. Immigrants responded by the thousands, making Wisconsin one of the most ``foreign'' states in the union and dotting the countryside with such settlements as New Glarus, New Holstein, Denmark, Belgium, Poland and Scandinavia. Ethnicity is still one of our hallmarks--a focus of festivals, an anchor of identity and, not least of all, a draw for tourists. But diversity has always had a dark side as well. Wisconsin has suffered periodic outbreaks of nativism throughout its history; like some modern suburbanites, established residents of every period have tried to pull up the gangplank as soon as they were safely on the boat. In the 1840s, for instance, when Irish and German immigrants demanded an equal voice in deliberations over statehood, the Milwaukee Sentinel was horrified: ``This is going too far. . . . One half of our population consists of foreigners and if this continues they will gain the upper hand and destroy our freedom. This thing is going too far.'' Wisconsin's immigrants returned the fire when their rights were threatened. In 1890, a Republican Legislature passed the Bennett Law, making instruction in English compulsory. Supporters of parochial schools were incensed. German, Scandinavian, Irish and Polish voters joined forces at the polls, making George Peck governor; he was the only Democrat to hold the pot between 1876 and 1932. Intolerance reached a peak of sorts during and just after World War I. Germans were, to put it bluntly, persecuted. Bach, Brahms, and Beethoven were banned from the concert stage. Sauerkraut was rechristened ``liberty cabbage.'' In 1919, the Milwaukee Journal won a Pulitzer Prize for its efforts to root out local Germans who sided with Kaiser Wilhelm. Soon after the war, nativists broadened their fire to include Poles, Italians, Greeks, Serbs and other ``new'' immigrants, a group that one bigot dismissed as ``historically downtrodden, atavistic and stagnant.'' Most politicians agreed. In the 1920s, Congress virtually halted the flow of immigration from southern and eastern Europe. The ``golden door'' lighted by the Statue of Liberty was slammed shut. Seventy years later, immigrants are once again suspect. The English First campaign of 1996 is only the latest in a long series of attempts to legislate conformity, attempts to legislate conformity, attempts that seem to crest during times of uncertainty. Patriots of every generation have tried, in historian Gerd Korman's choice phrase, ``to replace the melting pot with a pressure cooker.'' The campaign has been blasted as small-minded, shortsighted and racist by Hispanics, Asians and other language minorities. The English First movement may be all of those things, but it is most of all unnecessary. Anyone who has spent time in the newer ethnic communities will tell you that the pressures to conform are enormous. Through the media, through the schools, through their own children, immigrant families soon learn what America expects of them. If they want a place at the table, if they want even a taste of the American dream, English is mandatory. Why, then, the current outbreak of nativism? When you cut through all the rhetoric about ``uniting'' our society, what you sense is fear--fear that America is coming apart at the seams. The country seems to be filling in with strangers who show no eagerness to join the mainstream. That perception gives rise to a great unspoken question: Why can't they be like us? It is one of the oldest questions in America. Yankees asked it of the Germans and the Irish, the Germans and Irish asked it of the Poles and Italians, and everyone asks it of Hispanics and Asians. The fact that so many groups once considered ``they'' have joined the ranks of ``us'' is, I would suggest, an obvious sign of America's power to absorb differences. But there are always newcomers to question. And what should they answer? They should, in my opinion, respond that they are challenging the rest of us to live up to an ideal as old as the Republic: a belief that the many can become one without rejecting their ancestors, that unity and diversity can coexist in a creative and energizing tension. There is only one noun in this country, and that is American. But there are dozens of adjectives: African, Belgian, Croatian, Danish, English, Filipino, German and on down the alphabet. It is our differences, mediated by our essential unity, that give this country its human appeal and its human power. Those who would stifle diversity are denying themselves an important gift. Those who would insist on ``English First'' are betraying their own ignorance and their own pettiness, but they display something even more disturbing: a lack of faith in America.

Their measure would establish English as the ``official language of Wisconsin'' and would, with a few carefully worded exceptions, prohibit the use of other languages in ``all written expression'' by any unit of state or local government. It seems puzzling, at first, that the bill would get a serious hearing in a state as ethnic as Wisconsin. It seems even stranger that elected officials would deny some current residents a privilege that their own ancestors enjoyed: the right to be addressed in their native tongues. Linguistic diversity, officially endorsed, is older than the state. When Solomon Juneau became Milwaukee's first mayor in 1846, 1,000 copies of his inaugural address were printed-- 500 in English and 500 in German. The same policy was observed when Wisconsin adopted a constitution two years later. In the 1850s and '60s, the state published guidebooks in German, Norwegian, French, Dutch and Swedish, as well as in English, hoping to attract newcomers from Europe. Immigrants responded by the thousands, making Wisconsin one of the most ``foreign'' states in the union and dotting the countryside with such settlements as New Glarus, New Holstein, Denmark, Belgium, Poland and Scandinavia. Ethnicity is still one of our hallmarks--a focus of festivals, an anchor of identity and, not least of all, a draw for tourists. But diversity has always had a dark side as well. Wisconsin has suffered periodic outbreaks of nativism throughout its history; like some modern suburbanites, established residents of every period have tried to pull up the gangplank as soon as they were safely on the boat. In the 1840s, for instance, when Irish and German immigrants demanded an equal voice in deliberations over statehood, the Milwaukee Sentinel was horrified: ``This is going too far. . . . One half of our population consists of foreigners and if this continues they will gain the upper hand and destroy our freedom. This thing is going too far.'' Wisconsin's immigrants returned the fire when their rights were threatened. In 1890, a Republican Legislature passed the Bennett Law, making instruction in English compulsory. Supporters of parochial schools were incensed. German, Scandinavian, Irish and Polish voters joined forces at the polls, making George Peck governor; he was the only Democrat to hold the pot between 1876 and 1932. Intolerance reached a peak of sorts during and just after World "", 'War I.', "" Germans were, to put it bluntly, persecuted. Bach, Brahms, and Beethoven were banned from the concert stage. Sauerkraut was rechristened ``liberty cabbage.'' In 1919, the Milwaukee Journal won a Pulitzer Prize for its efforts to root out local Germans who sided with Kaiser Wilhelm. Soon after the war, nativists broadened their fire to include Poles, Italians, Greeks, Serbs and other ``new'' immigrants, a group that one bigot dismissed as ``historically downtrodden, atavistic and stagnant.'' Most politicians agreed. In the 1920s, Congress virtually halted the flow of immigration from southern and eastern Europe. The ``golden door'' lighted by the Statue of Liberty was slammed shut. Seventy years later, immigrants are once again suspect. The English First campaign of 1996 is only the latest in a long series of attempts to legislate conformity, attempts to legislate conformity, attempts that seem to crest during times of uncertainty. Patriots of every generation have tried, in historian Gerd Korman's choice phrase, ``to replace the melting pot with a pressure cooker.'' The campaign has been blasted as small-minded, shortsighted and racist by Hispanics, Asians and other language minorities. The English First movement may be all of those things, but it is most of all unnecessary. Anyone who has spent time in the newer ethnic communities will tell you that the pressures to conform are enormous. Through the media, through the schools, through their own children, immigrant families soon learn what America expects of them. If they want a place at the table, if they want even a taste of the American dream, English is mandatory. Why, then, the current outbreak of nativism? When you cut through all the rhetoric about ``uniting'' our society, what you sense is fear--fear that America is coming apart at the seams. The country seems to be filling in with strangers who show no eagerness to join the mainstream. That perception gives rise to a great unspoken question: Why can't they be like us? It is one of the oldest questions in America. Yankees asked it of the Germans and the Irish, the Germans and Irish asked it of the Poles and Italians, and everyone asks it of Hispanics and Asians. The fact that so many groups once considered ``they'' have joined the ranks of ``us'' is, I would suggest, an obvious sign of America's power to absorb differences. But there are always newcomers to question. And what should they answer? They should, in my opinion, respond that they are challenging the rest of us to live up to an ideal as old as the Republic: a belief that the many can become one without rejecting their ancestors, that unity and diversity can coexist in a creative and energizing tension. There is only one noun in this country, and that is American. But there are dozens of adjectives: African, Belgian, Croatian, Danish, English, Filipino, German and on down the alphabet. It is our differences, mediated by our essential unity, that give this country its human appeal and its human power. Those who would stifle diversity are denying themselves an important gift. Those who would insist on ``English First'' are betraying their own ignorance and their own pettiness, but they display something even more disturbing: a lack of faith in America. ""]"
50,"POTENTIAL DEPLOYMENT OF AMERICAN TROOPS TO BOSNIA Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, this week the Senate and the House began conducting hearings on the potential deployment of American ground forces to Bosnia and Herzegovina in the event a peace agreement is reached. This is the beginning of a very important process of congressional review and debate. I am pleased that the administration sent the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to testify on behalf of the administration's proposal. Any decision to send American Forces into harms' way requires the utmost consideration. American interests may justify sending Americans into Bosnia, but the goals must be clear and the risks must be understood and weighed carefully. Unfortunately, the administration has not yet made the case for its proposed operation. Many questions remain unanswered and many answers remain ambiguous. The first task must be to persuade the Congress that this is the best option of the options available. And let me be clear, there are other options. For over 3 years now, I have called for American leadership. For over 3 years now, I have called for NATO involvement. But, I am not convinced that exercising United States leadership and deploying NATO ground forces in support of a peace agreement that partitions Bosnia is the best or only option. We need to know: will American Forces be the guarantors of ethnic cleansing? Will they be used to prevent Moslem refugees from returning to their homes in what becomes the Bosnian Serb Republic? With respect to the peace settlement, the administration must be able to ensure that any peace reached is a stable and sustainable peace-- that there are defensible borders; that the Bosnian Government structure is viable; that this is not just the first step toward a greater Serbia. If there is a genuine peace, there is a real question why tens of thousands of peacekeepers, including Americans, are needed? Moreover, how did the administration come up with the number 25,000 for the American ground force contribution? Is this solely the result of President Clinton's speech 2 years ago or is there a military rationale for it? There is a lot of confusion as to what NATO's role will be. Will NATO ensure the territorial integrity of Bosnia? Who will accomplish the tasks that NATO does not wish to be involved in, such as facilitating the return of refugees, the conduct of free and fair elections, humanitarian operations? What will this operation cost? What factors are current cost estimates based on? How does the administration plan to pay for such an operation? Was Secretary Perry serious when he said that the administration would take funds from missile defense programs--intended to protect Americans from the growing threat of missile defenses--for peacekeeping? What are the criteria for success of this operation? What is the exit strategy? How do we ensure that the Bosnians can defend themselves once peacekeepers leave? Who will arm and or train the Bosnians? It seems to me that developments in recent months have vindicated the overwhelming majority in Congress who argued that the Bosnians and the Croats were capable of defending themselves if armed. It has also demonstrated that NATO air power can be used effectively and that Bosnian Serb Forces are not invincible. The military balance began shifting in Bosnia, but I am not sure that it has stabilized. In my view, lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia is as relevant in a post- settlement situation as it is now. This matter cannot be avoided and must be resolved as part of any peace settlement. The bottom line is that Congress is not yet in possession of the facts. Indeed, the administration is not in possession of the facts. There is no settlement yet. But, with that in mind, we must make sure that we do not deploy any forces without clear answers to these critical questions. I am deeply concerned that since current NATO plans call for initial deployments within a few days of a settlement being signed that we may not have all the answers--and that the administration will go ahead and deploy forces and try to figure out what they will be doing after they are already on the ground. In view of these many unanswered questions--and those I have raised are by no means all-inclusive--I would strongly urge the administration to cooperate with the Congress and provide us with the information we need to make an informed judgment. Furthermore, I strongly urge the administration to seek congressional authorization for any deployment of United States ground forces to Bosnia. This was my view prior to the gulf war, and it is now. It is essential that the American people are behind any undertaking that places thousands of our soldiers in a dangerous environment for a prolonged period of time. Mr. President, let me also express my deep concern about other aspects of the diplomatic process and the talks that are due to begin on August 31 in Dayton, OH. The agenda does not include Kosova which has been under martial law for over 6 years now. This is not just a matter of human rights, but a question of Kosova's status. Even in the former Yugoslavia, Kosova had autonomous status--the people and their assembly could make their own decisions. Today, there are 2 million Albanians there under an apartheid-like system--A large majority terrorized and oppressed by a small minority. We cannot let Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic off the hook for Kosova, or for his continued support of paramilitary forces which are reported today to have slaughtered hundreds of Moslem men and boys in northern Bosnia. Milosevic is no peacemaker, rather the mastermind behind ethnic cleansing, oppression, and aggression in the former Yugoslavia. As early as 1992, senior U.S. Government officials accused him of war crimes. But today, he has been invited by this administration to the United States to participate in peace talks. I believe that this was a serious error in judgment which calls into question the administration's commitment to the prosecution of war criminals in the former Yugoslavia. Sure, Milosevic has not yet been indicted by the war crimes tribunal, but, there is no doubt that he has given support and safe haven to some of the most notorious war criminals. Slobodan Milosevic should not be issued a visa. If the administration insists on this, at the very least, it should ensure that any visa issued to Milosevic confines him to Wright Patterson Air Force Base. He does not deserve to be treated like other foreign dignitaries. Finally, there should be no comprehensive sanctions relief on Serbia until there is a satisfactory resolution of the situation in Kosova. Unless there is a comprehensive settlement including Kosova, there will be no stability in the region--one of the key objectives presently being cited by the administration. The sanctions on Serbia are the only leverage the United States and the international community have been willing to use on the Belgrade regime. Mr. President, I hope that the administration will address my concerns and those of my colleagues, and cooperate with the Congress so that together we can determine what is in the best interest of the United States.

51,"BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA SELF-DEFENSE ACT Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my comments are about support of this resolution concerning the arms embargo. I know the hour is late, but this is a very, very important subject that has concerned me, as it has concerned so many Members of the Senate, for several years. I am hoping that we come to some resolution of this matter on this occasion. I understand the majority leader's desire to consider the President's request. I look forward to the results of that discussion and the decisions that come from it. But I do rise tonight in support of the Dole-Lieberman resolution. Let me begin by mentioning three reservations I have about taking this position. First of all, I think the truest words of the day were those of Senator Cohen of Maine who said, ``No one can predict with complete confidence whether our action in this case or inaction in this case will turn out the way we want.'' This is a situation that requires the greatest humility on the part of a Senator because we cannot know for sure and because it does involve what is obviously life or death for many, many thousands of people in the former Yugoslavia. The facts are about as complex as they can get in a foreign policy situation. My second reservation in supporting the resolution is that basically I think the President should be our leader in conducting foreign policy, with the assistance of Congress in certain cases; in some cases only with congressional approval. I happen to believe, under the War Powers Act, and article I of the Constitution, that we have a preeminent role in making sure that we do not commit troops without congressional approval. But, generally speaking, I prefer to defer to the President, especially Democratic Presidents, on this kind of an issue. Third, although I have tremendous respect for the majority leader, I have generally preferred the foreign policy approach of our current President. This President has kept American youth out of wars. He has resisted the temptation to send us into adventures and to take every opportunity to police the world as, unfortunately, other Presidents have failed to do. The President has shown a steady hand and does not believe that we can afford or want to shed the blood to be the policemen of the world. But, despite these reservations, and while I think the majority leader is a great Senator and I hope he continues in that capacity for many, many years, I have long supported his view that we should lift the arms embargo on Bosnia and we should do so unilaterally, if necessary. I do think it is necessary, and I do think the time is now. In fact, my hope has been and continues to be that this will truly be a strong bipartisan vote. In fact, when I first got here, Mr. President, long before I realized the majority leader's position, before he was the majority leader, my first resolution as a United States Senator made one simple request: That the arms embargo be lifted for the Bosnian people. That was in March 1993. Even prior to the election in 1992, before I was a Member of this body, I followed the work of the Senator from Delaware, Senator Biden, who had already, before almost anyone else, understood that the key to this situation was not talking about certain American air raids or sending American troops to Bosnia, but giving them the ability to defend themselves. One of the most stimulating comments of the day, and I listened to a lot of the debate, was that of the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, who spoke of lifting the arms embargo, and indicated, as I have heard him say on many occasions, that he supports lifting the arms embargo if we can. But the Senator from Massachusetts indicated that lifting the arms embargo is not a policy. I am not so sure. In fact, after scores of conversations with people, experts in foreign policy, and the military, my constituents, and especially the leaders of Bosnia itself, I feel, with all due respect, that all signs point to the conclusion that lifting the arms embargo unilaterally is not only morally right, but a very sensible policy, both for the United States and for Bosnia. I am sure the opposition to lifting is in good faith. But after 2\1/ 2\ years I almost stopped asking questions on the committee where we serve together, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I grew weary at the committee meetings and the briefings of the constantly shifting series of excuses for not doing what is right in Bosnia. The opposition to lifting the arms embargo has been done in a very clever way. It is opposition by question, hundreds of questions, hundreds of scenarios, always the worst-case scenario. It is the most amazing variety of reasons I have ever seen. There are too many reasons being given, too many shifting back and forth, and sometimes contradicting each other. It does not seem credible. We even heard in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at a hearing the claim that lifting the arms embargo would lead to an Islamic jihad. Some of these arguments are just way beyond the pale. We are subjected to an astonishing parade of ``horribles.'' But, Mr. President, what is actually happening--not what is projected--is what is horrible and actual unending inhuman horror. We are urged on the floor today to try one last time. We are told that lifting the arms embargo is just like giving up. But to many Americans, it just makes sense. It looks like to many Americans that we never even got started helping the Bosnians if we could not do the most simple thing, which is to lift the arms embargo. We have never taken the first step and the most important step. We have never lifted the arms embargo so that we have the opportunity not to work with a captive and defeated Bosnia, but with an increasingly viable country, an increasingly viable military, working to defend itself and working perhaps to push back the Serbians to the lines where they were before. In fact, Mr. President, the comments that I have heard most from all of my constituents is, ``Why in the world don't we simply let these folks try and defend themselves?'' Mr. President, other Members of this body did a very good job today answering some of these objections. But I think we ought to reiterate it a little bit. I want to give again the scope of all of the excuses being given for not lifting the arms embargo. Naturally, we have a tendency to want to defer to those who have military expertise. But in some of these cases the answer is very easy and obvious. For example, there is the claim that lifting the arms embargo will mean that the United Nations will be put in a position where none of its resolutions will be respected; the claim that this is, in effect, thumbing our nose at the United Nations and the Security Council. But the Senator from New York has made the point well that no other situation, no other resolution is in this status. This one involves the violation of article 51 of the U.N. Charter which calls for the right of self-defense for all countries. That is legally superior [[Page S 10326]] under the U.N. charter to any particular resolution of this kind. In other cases, such as Rwanda or Angola or the Sudan, there are arms embargoes but those involve civil wars, internal strife. They do not involve a clear situation of one sovereign entity being involved in attacking another. Mr. President, that argument does not hold water. Another argument that I have heard and the question that is constantly asked is, ``Well, if they get the arms, how are they going to get trained? How are they going to know how to use the guns?'' I sat in a private briefing a couple of weeks ago with a number of Senators and with the majority leader. And the majority leader asked that question of Haris Silajdzic, the Prime Minister of Bosnia. He said, ``We know how to use these arms. We are trained. We are not asking for the most sophisticated aircraft.'' They are simply asking for the normal weaponry of a ground war. I have here a list of what has actually been requested--certain kinds of defense arms, means of communication, electric power, health, satellite links, various types of vehicles, generators, clothing, surgical equipment. These are the kinds of things that are being requested. The notion that somehow massive special training is necessary is not valid. Another argument that comes up: ``How are the arms going to get there in this difficult situation?'' Well, it is a difficult situation. But arms are already getting there despite the embargo to some extent. How do people think the Bosnian Muslims are fighting? Some have gotten through, and particularly with the alliance between Croatia and Bosnia, that sealane. The necessary access to the sea through Croatia would be available to provide the arms. Another argument made: ``We will have to pay for all these arms. It is going to be expensive.'' It is true. If we want to supply the arms, it will cost something. Senator Biden's amendment a few years ago provided for 50 million American dollars. But there is nothing in this resolution that says we have to supply the arms. Other countries are ready do it. I think it is a good idea if we participate. It is not a choice that it is an open checkoff. It simply says they are permitted to obtain arms. There is nothing in this resolution that requires that. Mr. President, in addition to these examples of sort of legal or tactical questions, there has been very heavy emphasis today on two other arguments. One is, ``This is not the right time.'' And the other is, ``This action will `Americanize' the war.'' To me, these are probably the two most troubling arguments I have heard lately. They remind me of double talk, or maybe worse. They remind me, in George Orwell's words, of ``double speak.'' First of all, this notion that it is not the right time--I was told the first time I mentioned this issue in early 1993 that if we would just hang on, ``The change is right around the corner; we are going to work this out; we should not lift the arms embargo; it will cause a terrible problem.'' But after each tragedy we get the same excuse, the same flutter of activity. Things die down for a while, and we are told again that we should wait. It is also troubling to me that we learn the names of these little towns in Bosnia and witness the tragedy, and then a few days later we do not even remember where the last tragedy occurred. But we are still told, ``Wait a little longer; wait until a few more towns go down the tubes.'' It has been 30 months. How can someone talking in any way that would be considered straight say that we have to wait longer? How many times must U.S. Senators speak until the message gets through? I just had my staff tally up how many speeches have been given on this subject since 1993. Just in the U.S. Senate alone, there were 210 speeches by Senators. Almost, I say, the vast majority of them were in favor of lifting the arms embargo. Mr. President, what are we waiting for? Are we waiting for perfect weather conditions? This is not a moon shot. This is an ongoing, horrible tragedy. And anyone can construct a reason why we should wait. But you cannot wait any longer when you witness every day on the television what can only be described as genocide. What about this second argument, this mantra, ``This is going to Americanize the war''? This one really bothers me. It is a slogan. People say we are committed, we are obligated to send 25,000 ground troops into Bosnia if we lift the arms embargo. When do we vote on that? When did Congress authorize 25,000 troops going into Bosnia? Under my view of the law and the Constitution, the Chair and I should have had a chance to vote on that. We did not do it. We did not make that commitment. And again, it is the ultimate in double speak to suggest that giving people the right to defend themselves is the thing that will cause us to have to go and defend them. That is what we are being told, that somehow giving them some guns or making sure they can buy some guns is the way to guarantee that all the rest of us would have to go over there and get involved. That is just nonsense. It is the opposite. Lifting the arms embargo is the best way to ensure that American men and women will not have to spill their blood. This is a lesson that the State of Israel has understood very well since 1948. The one thing that Israel always said is, ``We want help in terms of arms, logistical help, but we do not want American men and women to come here and fight on our soil.'' We always appreciated that sentiment, but it is not just to be nice. It is because the Israelis know that if we send troops onto Israeli soil and American men and women die, the obvious result will be probably a reduction in American support for that effort. That it will turn people off. They will say, ``Why help Israel?'' All you have to do is reference Somalia. It is exactly what happened in Somalia. People had compassion. They cared about the people in Somalia. They wanted to help them eat. But when it came to American men and women dying, they really had to question whether we could police the entire world. Well, the Bosnians understand this. And that is why they are sincere when they say that they did not want our troops. They want some help or at least not have us prevent them from getting the arms to defend themselves. Why can we as a nation say in some instances, ``This we can do. We can do no more. But we will do this.''? We do not want to police this situation. The American people will not support this as the absolute core of our national security. We probably are not ready to say in the case of Bosnia that we will bear any burden. But we are ready to do something as a people. We do want the Bosnians to be free. We do want them to be able to turn back Serbian aggression. So, Mr. President, this is the opposite of the Americanization of the war. This is how Bosnia determines its own destiny. Mr. President, maybe what has bothered me even more than these more convenient arguments is my problem with the position that the administration has taken when it says over and over again, ``We support lifting the arms embargo, but only multilaterally.'' But they are against unilateral lifting. And time and time again there have been statements from the administration indicating support, not for unilateral but for multilateral lifting of the arms embargo. A relatively recent example was March 20, 1995, where Mr. Richard Holbrooke stated: Only a negotiated settlement has any chance of lasting. This administration is committed to pursuing that goal. What we must not do is worsen the situation by unilaterally lifting the arms embargo. We have always believed the embargo is unfair and worked to end it multilaterally. This has consistently been the statement of the administration. They oppose unilateral, but they are for the multilateral lifting of the arms embargo. But usually when you look at the actual reasons why they are against the unilateral lift, they are just as true of the multilateral lift. Again, it is halfhearted arguments to justify a policy. And I know why the administration wants to do this. It is not a bad reason. They do not want to break faith with their allies, the British and the French, in particular, and even our relationship with the Russians, who do not want us [[Page S 10327]] to lift the arms embargo. That is the real reason. What they say is they are for lifting the arms embargo if only they could get the French and the British to go along. Well, Mr. President, it does not hold up. For example, they say if you lift the arms embargo unilaterally, the allied troops will be in danger. Well, what is going on right now? Multilateral action there. And my figures indicate May 28, 377 peacekeepers taken hostage. Just last week at Srebrenica, the attack on the Dutch peacekeepers. The fact is that under either scenario, unilateral or multilateral, these folks are in danger. They are in danger now, and they would be then. At least if the Bosnians were properly armed, maybe those Serbians who like to go into the safe havens and attack peacekeepers and civilians would think twice if they knew there was a force to oppose them, not just a bunch of U.N. peacekeepers who are not allowed to do anything about them. Second, it is said that a unilateral lift would upset the Russians. My feeling about that is that that is a completely disingenuous argument because everyone knows the Russians can veto a multilateral lifting request. So the administration knows that is not going to happen. And certainly the Russians did not pay any attention to our feelings about this type of issue when they did their actions in Chechnya. A third argument is, if you lift the arms embargo, the Serbians will get arms too. Well, they may. But the fact is, they are already very well armed. They were the beneficiaries of the fifth largest stockpile of arms in all of Europe because of this foolish arms embargo. How would this be different with a multilateral lift? Surely, if there is a multilateral lift and the Serbians want to get more arms, they will get it that way just as they will with the unilateral lifting of the arms embargo. Finally, the incredible claim that under the unilateral lifting, the war will spread, and to somehow suggest that the war will not spread if we have a multi-lifting of the arms embargo. Why? Why is that the case? Surely it would spread either way to some extent. So I do not understand how the administration can claim that there is a difference between unilateral and multilateral. And that is deeply troubling to me. I think the administration simply opposes lifting the arms embargo and should be straightforward about it so that the Bosnian people and the Members of Congress could know where they really stand. So, Mr. President, why? Why have we been subjected to this avalanche of arguments, this manufacturing of arguments to stop lifting the arms embargo? It is to block the lifting of the arms embargo, obviously. But I think it is a symptom of what I like to call the all-or-nothing attitude about the military role of the United States in this world. Either we have to do everything, that our credibility says that if we do one thing we have to send in troops later on or our credibility is shot. I do not buy that. In some cases that may be true. In an alliance with NATO, you bet. That is the pledge. But America cannot and certainly has not signed on to the notion that every time we help somebody do something to defend themselves, we therefore have to commit the entire force of our country. That is not the case. And I do not think it is what the Bosnian people expect. What is our end game? Are we going to just defend Bosnia and somehow broker a peace agreement and then leave this morsel of a country with no defense, to do what? Are we going to have a permanent U.N. force there? Are we just going to leave someday and hope the Serbians are nice to them? There is a better scenario, and that scenario is, let these folks continue to learn to defend themselves, to actually defend themselves, to have the pride of having protected their nation. You know, that is how we got started. That is how Israel got started in 1948, and it made all the difference that they won their own freedom. Yes, maybe with other people's arms but with their own strength and courage--and, of course, sacrifice. What is our plan? To make Bosnia one big safe-haven forever? A country that is going to be free has to be able to defend itself and it has to know how to defend itself. And you need arms in order to do that. Mr. President, I think lifting the arms embargo is the key to the permanent freedom of Bosnia. Finally, Mr. President, the question for me more than anything else is, where did anyone get the idea that we have the right to stand in the way of a self-defense of a free people that we have recognized as an independent country? What did we do in 1776? We were not even free. We were supposedly pledged in loyalty to the King of England. We decided we wanted to make our own self-determination. Somebody helped us get some help and some arms because we were standing for our own freedom. Mr. President, what is the second amendment all about, the U.S. Constitution? I happen to be a believer that that second amendment of the U.S. Constitution is important. I think we do have a right in this country or a reasonable opportunity to defend ourselves. And the reason for that amendment more than anything else was that the right of a people to keep and bear arms is necessary for a free people. That is what this is about, too. It is not just Americans who feel this way about self-defense. It is people in every country, including Bosnia. Mr. President, do we not remember appeasement in Europe? Do we not remember the constant embarrassment that we were taken in by the Nazis, that we actually believed--speaking here more of Britain than ourselves, of course--but we actually believed they were going to take this much space, just the Sudetenland, just Czechoslovakia, just Poland. What we are dealing with here are people who--apparently the leaders of Serbia--who want a greater Serbia. They will not stop if we continue to appease them. Mr. President, do we not remember the Warsaw ghetto? We acknowledged the 50th anniversary of the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto against the Nazis. Did we say, would it not be better if they had not resisted? There would be less bloodshed if they had not taken up arms against the Nazis. That is not what we said. We commemorated the heroism and the courage of people in a concentration camp who, knowing they were going to die, decided to die with dignity. Mr. President, when I was a teenager I was given a book called ``While Six Million Died.'' The book told a tough story for a young kid who was a Democrat, and still believes that Franklin Roosevelt was the greatest President in this country. It told of how that administration knew of some of the things that were going on to the Jews and others in Europe. It told how we did not really do everything we could do. Mr. President, I recently toured the Holocaust Museum again, and they talked about the difficulty of President Roosevelt's decision not to, for example, bomb some of the concentration camps. Well, at least in that case Franklin Roosevelt knew what he was trying to do. He believed, for the greater good of this world, that he could win the war and defeat the Nazis. He had a plan. And with Winston Churchill and others the plan was effective. But, Mr. President, we cannot use that excuse here. We have no plan. We have no intention of actually stopping Serbian aggression. So it is not understandable why we sit back and wait. Finally, Mr. President, when all is said and done, should not we ask the Bosnians themselves what they want? Should we impose upon them the notion that we are going to just keep these U.N. forces there for their own good? I think it is condescending, humiliating, and patronizing to the Bosnian people to suggest that we know better, that it is for their own good that we not lift the arms embargo. Let me conclude by just reading three statements from the Prime Minister of Bosnia that I think symbolize this issue better than anything else and the need for lifting the arms embargo. The prime minister has said first that: If the Serbs' aggression continues, we prefer military help over food for dead people. The aggression, plus the arms embargo, plus the nondeliverance of aid means death to Bosnia. [[Page S 10328]] And he said in March 1993: We would prefer doing it ourselves, but for that we need arms. The arms embargo is what is humiliating. The humiliation is to be slaughtered like an animal and not be able to defend yourself like a man. Finally, Mr. President, very recently, May 28, 1995, Mr. Silajdzic just laid it on the line, as he has tried time and time again to do. He means it. He does not want American soldiers there. He does not want the Americanization of the war. This is what he wants and this is what he will do. He says: The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is perfectly willing and able to defend our country and our citizens. We do not now, nor have we ever, asked for any ground forces from any country in the world to do our fighting for us. We have the men. We have the courage. But we do not have the means. That is all they are asking, Mr. President, a chance to protect their own lives, their own women, their own children, and to do something about this heartless Serbian aggression. So, Mr. President, although I again am eager to hear the outcome of the talks between President Clinton and others in the Congress, I do believe we should move forward as soon as possible to pass this resolution to unilaterally lift the arms embargo. I thank the Chair and everyone for their patience. I yield the floor.

Mr. President, my comments are about support of this resolution concerning the arms embargo. I know the hour is late, but this is a very, very important subject that has concerned me, as it has concerned so many Members of the Senate, for several years. I am hoping that we come to some resolution of this matter on this occasion. I understand the majority leader's desire to consider the President's request. I look forward to the results of that discussion and the decisions that come from it. But I do rise tonight in support of the Dole-Lieberman resolution. Let me begin by mentioning three reservations I have about taking this position. First of all, I think the truest words of the day were those of Senator Cohen of Maine who said, ``No one can predict with complete confidence whether our action in this case or inaction in this case will turn out the way we want.'' This is a situation that requires the greatest humility on the part of a Senator because we cannot know for sure and because it does involve what is obviously life or death for many, many thousands of people in the former Yugoslavia. The facts are about as complex as they can get in a foreign policy situation. My second reservation in supporting the resolution is that basically I think the President should be our leader in conducting foreign policy, with the assistance of Congress in certain cases; in some cases only with congressional approval. I happen to believe, under the War Powers Act, and article I of the Constitution, that we have a preeminent role in making sure that we do not commit troops without congressional approval. But, generally speaking, I prefer to defer to the President, especially Democratic Presidents, on this kind of an issue. Third, although I have tremendous respect for the majority leader, I have generally preferred the foreign policy approach of our current President. This President has kept American youth out of wars. He has resisted the temptation to send us into adventures and to take every opportunity to police the world as, unfortunately, other Presidents have failed to do. The President has shown a steady hand and does not believe that we can afford or want to shed the blood to be the policemen of the world. But, despite these reservations, and while I think the majority leader is a great Senator and I hope he continues in that capacity for many, many years, I have long supported his view that we should lift the arms embargo on Bosnia and we should do so unilaterally, if necessary. I do think it is necessary, and I do think the time is now. In fact, my hope has been and continues to be that this will truly be a strong bipartisan vote. In fact, when I first got here, Mr. President, long before I realized the majority leader's position, before he was the majority leader, my first resolution as a United States Senator made one simple request: That the arms embargo be lifted for the Bosnian people. That was in March 1993. Even prior to the election in 1992, before I was a Member of this body, I followed the work of the Senator from Delaware, Senator Biden, who had already, before almost anyone else, understood that the key to this situation was not talking about certain American air raids or sending American troops to Bosnia, but giving them the ability to defend themselves. One of the most stimulating comments of the day, and I listened to a lot of the debate, was that of the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, who spoke of lifting the arms embargo, and indicated, as I have heard him say on many occasions, that he supports lifting the arms embargo if we can. But the Senator from Massachusetts indicated that lifting the arms embargo is not a policy. I am not so sure. In fact, after scores of conversations with people, experts in foreign policy, and the military, my constituents, and especially the leaders of Bosnia itself, I feel, with all due respect, that all signs point to the conclusion that lifting the arms embargo unilaterally is not only morally right, but a very sensible policy, both for the United States and for Bosnia. I am sure the opposition to lifting is in good faith. But after 2\1/ 2\ years I almost stopped asking questions on the committee where we serve together, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I grew weary at the committee meetings and the briefings of the constantly shifting series of excuses for not doing what is right in Bosnia. The opposition to lifting the arms embargo has been done in a very clever way. It is opposition by question, hundreds of questions, hundreds of scenarios, always the worst-case scenario. It is the most amazing variety of reasons I have ever seen. There are too many reasons being given, too many shifting back and forth, and sometimes contradicting each other. It does not seem credible. We even heard in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at a hearing the claim that lifting the arms embargo would lead to an Islamic jihad. Some of these arguments are just way beyond the pale. We are subjected to an astonishing parade of ``horribles.'' But, Mr. President, what is actually happening--not what is projected--is what is horrible and actual unending inhuman horror. We are urged on the floor today to try one last time. We are told that lifting the arms embargo is just like giving up. But to many Americans, it just makes sense. It looks like to many Americans that we never even got started helping the Bosnians if we could not do the most simple thing, which is to lift the arms embargo. We have never taken the first step and the most important step. We have never lifted the arms embargo so that we have the opportunity not to work with a captive and defeated Bosnia, but with an increasingly viable country, an increasingly viable military, working to defend itself and working perhaps to push back the Serbians to the lines where they were before. In fact, Mr. President, the comments that I have heard most from all of my constituents is, ``Why in the world don't we simply let these folks try and defend themselves?'' Mr. President, other Members of this body did a very good job today answering some of these objections. But I think we ought to reiterate it a little bit. I want to give again the scope of all of the excuses being given for not lifting the arms embargo. Naturally, we have a tendency to want to defer to those who have military expertise. But in some of these cases the answer is very easy and obvious. For example, there is the claim that lifting the arms embargo will mean that the United Nations will be put in a position where none of its resolutions will be respected; the claim that this is, in effect, thumbing our nose at the United Nations and the Security Council. But the Senator from New York has made the point well that no other situation, no other resolution is in this status. This one involves the violation of article 51 of the U.N. Charter which calls for the right of self-defense for all countries. That is legally superior [[Page S 10326]] under the U.N. charter to any particular resolution of this kind. In other cases, such as Rwanda or Angola or the Sudan, there are arms embargoes but those involve civil wars, internal strife. They do not involve a clear situation of one sovereign entity being involved in attacking another. Mr. President, that argument does not hold water. Another argument that I have heard and the question that is constantly asked is, ``Well, if they get the arms, how are they going to get trained? How are they going to know how to use the guns?'' I sat in a private briefing a couple of weeks ago with a number of Senators and with the majority leader. And the majority leader asked that question of Haris Silajdzic, the Prime Minister of Bosnia. He said, ``We know how to use these arms. We are trained. We are not asking for the most sophisticated aircraft.'' They are simply asking for the normal weaponry of a ground war. I have here a list of what has actually been requested--certain kinds of defense arms, means of communication, electric power, health, satellite links, various types of vehicles, generators, clothing, surgical equipment. These are the kinds of things that are being requested. The notion that somehow massive special training is necessary is not valid. Another argument that comes up: ``How are the arms going to get there in this difficult situation?'' Well, it is a difficult situation. But arms are already getting there despite the embargo to some extent. How do people think the Bosnian Muslims are fighting? Some have gotten through, and particularly with the alliance between Croatia and Bosnia, that sealane. The necessary access to the sea through Croatia would be available to provide the arms. Another argument made: ``We will have to pay for all these arms. It is going to be expensive.'' It is true. If we want to supply the arms, it will cost something. Senator Biden's amendment a few years ago provided for 50 million American dollars. But there is nothing in this resolution that says we have to supply the arms. Other countries are ready do it. I think it is a good idea if we participate. It is not a choice that it is an open checkoff. It simply says they are permitted to obtain arms. There is nothing in this resolution that requires that. Mr. President, in addition to these examples of sort of legal or tactical questions, there has been very heavy emphasis today on two other arguments. One is, ``This is not the right time.'' And the other is, ``This action will `Americanize' the war.'' To me, these are probably the two most troubling arguments I have heard lately. They remind me of double talk, or maybe worse. They remind me, in George Orwell's words, of ``double speak.'' First of all, this notion that it is not the right time--I was told the first time I mentioned this issue in early 1993 that if we would just hang on, ``The change is right around the corner; we are going to work this out; we should not lift the arms embargo; it will cause a terrible problem.'' But after each tragedy we get the same excuse, the same flutter of activity. Things die down for a while, and we are told again that we should wait. It is also troubling to me that we learn the names of these little towns in Bosnia and witness the tragedy, and then a few days later we do not even remember where the last tragedy occurred. But we are still told, ``Wait a little longer; wait until a few more towns go down the tubes.'' It has been 30 months. How can someone talking in any way that would be considered straight say that we have to wait longer? How many times must U.S. Senators speak until the message gets through?

Almost, I say, the vast majority of them were in favor of lifting the arms embargo. Mr. President, what are we waiting for? Are we waiting for perfect weather conditions? This is not a moon shot. This is an ongoing, horrible tragedy. And anyone can construct a reason why we should wait. But you cannot wait any longer when you witness every day on the television what can only be described as genocide. What about this second argument, this mantra, ``This is going to Americanize the war''? This one really bothers me. It is a slogan. People say we are committed, we are obligated to send 25,000 ground troops into Bosnia if we lift the arms embargo. When do we vote on that? When did Congress authorize 25,000 troops going into Bosnia? Under my view of the law and the Constitution, the Chair and I should have had a chance to vote on that. We did not do it. We did not make that commitment. And again, it is the ultimate in double speak to suggest that giving people the right to defend themselves is the thing that will cause us to have to go and defend them. That is what we are being told, that somehow giving them some guns or making sure they can buy some guns is the way to guarantee that all the rest of us would have to go over there and get involved. That is just nonsense. It is the opposite. Lifting the arms embargo is the best way to ensure that American men and women will not have to spill their blood. This is a lesson that the State of Israel has understood very well since 1948. The one thing that Israel always said is, ``We want help in terms of arms, logistical help, but we do not want American men and women to come here and fight on our soil.''

Somebody helped us get some help and some arms because we were standing for our own freedom. Mr. President, what is the second amendment all about, the U.S. Constitution? I happen to be a believer that that second amendment of the U.S. Constitution is important. I think we do have a right in this country or a reasonable opportunity to defend ourselves. And the reason for that amendment more than anything else was that the right of a people to keep and bear arms is necessary for a free people. That is what this is about, too. It is not just Americans who feel this way about self-defense. It is people in every country, including Bosnia. Mr. President, do we not remember appeasement in Europe? Do we not remember the constant embarrassment that we were taken in by the Nazis, that we actually believed--speaking here more of Britain than ourselves, of course--but we actually believed they were going to take this much space, just the Sudetenland, just Czechoslovakia, just Poland. What we are dealing with here are people who--apparently the leaders of Serbia--who want a greater Serbia. They will not stop if we continue to appease them. Mr. President, do we not remember the Warsaw ghetto? We acknowledged the 50th anniversary of the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto against the Nazis. Did we say, would it not be better if they had not resisted? There would be less bloodshed if they had not taken up arms against the Nazis. That is not what we said. We commemorated the heroism and the courage of people in a concentration camp who, knowing they were going to die, decided to die with dignity. Mr. President, when I was a teenager I was given a book called ``While Six Million Died.'' The book told a tough story for a young kid who was a Democrat, and still believes that Franklin Roosevelt was the greatest President in this country. It told of how that administration knew of some of the things that were going on to the Jews and others in Europe. It told how we did not really do everything we could do. Mr. President, I recently toured the Holocaust Museum again, and they talked about the difficulty of President Roosevelt's decision not to, for example, bomb some of the concentration camps. Well, at least in that case Franklin Roosevelt knew what he was trying to do. He believed, for the greater good of this world, that he could win the war and defeat the Nazis. He had a plan. And with Winston Churchill and others the plan was effective. But, Mr. President, we cannot use that excuse here. We have no plan. We have no intention of actually stopping Serbian aggression. So it is not understandable why we sit back and wait. Finally, Mr. President, when all is said and done, should not we ask the Bosnians themselves what they want? Should we impose upon them the notion that we are going to just keep these U.N. forces there for their own good? I think it is condescending, humiliating, and patronizing to the Bosnian people to suggest that we know better, that it is for their own good that we not lift the arms embargo. Let me conclude by just reading three statements from the Prime Minister of Bosnia that I think symbolize this issue better than anything else and the need for lifting the arms embargo. The prime minister has said first that: If the Serbs' aggression continues, we prefer military help over food for dead people. The aggression, plus the arms embargo, plus the nondeliverance of aid means death to Bosnia. [[Page S 10328]] And he said in March 1993: We would prefer doing it ourselves, but for that we need arms. The arms embargo is what is humiliating. The humiliation is to be slaughtered like an animal and not be able to defend yourself like a man. Finally, Mr. President, very recently, May 28, 1995, Mr. Silajdzic just laid it on the line, as he has tried time and time again to do. He means it. He does not want American soldiers there. He does not want the Americanization of the war. This is what he wants and this is what he will do. He says: The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is perfectly willing and able to defend our country and our citizens. We do not now, nor have we ever, asked for any ground forces from any country in the world to do our fighting for us. We have the men. We have the courage. But we do not have the means. That is all they are asking, Mr. President, a chance to protect their own lives, their own women, their own children, and to do something about this heartless Serbian aggression. So, Mr. President, although I again am eager to hear the outcome of the talks between President Clinton and others in the Congress, I do believe we should move forward as soon as possible to pass this resolution to unilaterally lift the arms embargo. I thank the Chair and everyone for their patience. I yield the floor. ","['Mr. FEINGOLD.', "" Mr. President, my comments are about support of this resolution concerning the arms embargo. I know the hour is late, but this is a very, very important subject that has concerned me, as it has concerned so many Members of the Senate, for several years. I am hoping that we come to some resolution of this matter on this occasion. I understand the majority leader's desire to consider the President's request. I look forward to the results of that discussion and the decisions that come from it. "", 'But I ', ""do rise tonight in support of the Dole-Lieberman resolution. Let me begin by mentioning three reservations I have about taking this position. First of all, I think the truest words of the day were those of Senator Cohen of Maine who said, ``No one can predict with complete confidence whether our action in this case or inaction in this case will turn out the way we want.'' This is a situation that requires the greatest humility on the part of a Senator because we cannot know for sure and because it does involve what is obviously life or death for many, many thousands of people in the former Yugoslavia. The facts are about as complex as they can get in a foreign policy situation. My second reservation in supporting the resolution is that basically I think the President should be our leader in conducting foreign policy, with the assistance of Congress in certain cases; in some cases only with congressional approval. I happen to believe, under the War Powers Act, and article I of the Constitution, that we have a preeminent role in making sure that we do not commit troops without congressional approval. But, generally speaking, I prefer to defer to the President, especially Democratic Presidents, on this kind of an issue. Third, although I have tremendous respect for the majority leader, I have generally preferred the foreign policy approach of our current President. This President has kept American youth out of wars. He has resisted the temptation to send us into adventures and to take every opportunity to police the world as, unfortunately, other Presidents have failed to do. The President has shown a steady hand and does not believe that we can afford or want to shed the blood to be the policemen of the world. But, despite these reservations, and while I think the majority leader is a great Senator and I hope he continues in that capacity for many, many years, I have long supported his view that we should lift the arms embargo on Bosnia and we should do so unilaterally, if necessary. I do think it is necessary, and I do think the time is now. In fact, my hope has been and continues to be that this will truly be a strong bipartisan vote. In fact, when I first got here, Mr. President, long before I realized the majority leader's position, before he was the majority leader, my first resolution as a United States Senator made one simple request: That the arms embargo be lifted for the Bosnian people. That was in March 1993. Even prior to the election in 1992, before I was a Member of this body, I followed the work of the Senator from Delaware, Senator Biden, who had already, before almost anyone else, understood that the key to this situation was not talking about certain American air raids or sending American troops to Bosnia, but giving them the ability to defend themselves. One of the most stimulating comments of the day, and I listened to a lot of the debate, was that of the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, who spoke of lifting the arms embargo, and indicated, as I have heard him say on many occasions, that he supports lifting the arms embargo if we can. But the Senator from Massachusetts indicated that lifting the arms embargo is not a policy. I am not so sure. In fact, after scores of conversations with people, experts in foreign policy, and the military, my constituents, and especially the leaders of Bosnia itself, I feel, with all due respect, that all signs point to the conclusion that lifting the arms embargo unilaterally is not only morally right, but a very sensible policy, both for the United States and for "", 'Bosnia. I ', 'am sure the opposition to lifting is in good faith. But after 2\\1/ 2\\ years I almost stopped asking questions on the committee where we serve together, the Senate Foreign Relations ', 'Committee. I ', ""grew weary at the committee meetings and the briefings of the constantly shifting series of excuses for not doing what is right in Bosnia. The opposition to lifting the arms embargo has been done in a very clever way. It is opposition by question, hundreds of questions, hundreds of scenarios, always the worst-case scenario. It is the most amazing variety of reasons I have ever seen. There are too many reasons being given, too many shifting back and forth, and sometimes contradicting each other. It does not seem credible. We even heard in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at a hearing the claim that lifting the arms embargo would lead to an Islamic jihad. Some of these arguments are just way beyond the pale. We are subjected to an astonishing parade of ``horribles.'' But, Mr. President, what is actually happening--not what is projected--is what is horrible and actual unending inhuman horror. We are urged on the floor today to try one last time. We are told that lifting the arms embargo is just like giving up. But to many Americans, it just makes sense. It looks like to many Americans that we never even got started helping the Bosnians if we could not do the most simple thing, which is to lift the arms embargo. We have never taken the first step and the most important step. We have never lifted the arms embargo so that we have the opportunity not to work with a captive and defeated Bosnia, but with an increasingly viable country, an increasingly viable military, working to defend itself and working perhaps to push back the Serbians to the lines where they were before. In fact, Mr. President, the comments that I have heard most from all of my constituents is, ``Why in the world don't we simply let these folks try and defend themselves?'' Mr. President, other Members of this body did a very good job today answering some of these objections. "", 'But I ', 'think we ought to reiterate it a little bit. I want to give again the scope of all of the excuses being given for not lifting the arms embargo. Naturally, we have a tendency to want to defer to those who have military expertise. But in some of these cases the answer is very easy and obvious. For example, there is the claim that lifting the arms embargo will mean that the United Nations will be put in a position where none of its resolutions will be respected; the claim that this is, in effect, thumbing our nose at the United Nations and the Security Council. But the Senator from New York has made the point well that no other situation, no other resolution is in this status. This one involves the violation of article 51 of the U.N. Charter which calls for the right of self-defense for all countries. That is legally superior [[', 'Page S ', ""10326]] under the U.N. charter to any particular resolution of this kind. In other cases, such as Rwanda or Angola or the Sudan, there are arms embargoes but those involve civil wars, internal strife. They do not involve a clear situation of one sovereign entity being involved in attacking another. Mr. President, that argument does not hold water. Another argument that I have heard and the question that is constantly asked is, ``Well, if they get the arms, how are they going to get trained? How are they going to know how to use the guns?'' I sat in a private briefing a couple of weeks ago with a number of Senators and with the majority leader. And the majority leader asked that question of Haris Silajdzic, the Prime Minister of Bosnia. He said, ``We know how to use these arms. We are trained. We are not asking for the most sophisticated aircraft.'' They are simply asking for the normal weaponry of a ground war. I have here a list of what has actually been requested--certain kinds of defense arms, means of communication, electric power, health, satellite links, various types of vehicles, generators, clothing, surgical equipment. These are the kinds of things that are being requested. The notion that somehow massive special training is necessary is not valid. Another argument that comes up: ``How are the arms going to get there in this difficult situation?'' Well, it is a difficult situation. But arms are already getting there despite the embargo to some extent. How do people think the Bosnian Muslims are fighting? Some have gotten through, and particularly with the alliance between Croatia and Bosnia, that sealane. The necessary access to the sea through Croatia would be available to provide the arms. Another argument made: ``We will have to pay for all these arms. It is going to be expensive.'' It is true. If we want to supply the arms, it will cost something. Senator Biden's amendment a few years ago provided for 50 million American dollars. But there is nothing in this resolution that says we have to supply the arms. Other countries are ready do it. I think it is a good idea if we participate. It is not a choice that it is an open checkoff. It simply says they are permitted to obtain arms. There is nothing in this resolution that requires that. Mr. President, in addition to these examples of sort of legal or tactical questions, there has been very heavy emphasis today on two other arguments. One is, ``This is not the right time.'' And the other is, ``This action will `Americanize' the war.'' To me, these are probably the two most troubling arguments I have heard lately. They remind me of double talk, or maybe worse. They remind me, in George Orwell's words, of ``double speak.'' First of all, this notion that it is not the right time--I was told the first time I mentioned this issue in early 1993 that if we would just hang on, ``The change is right around the corner; we are going to work this out; we should not lift the arms embargo; it will cause a terrible problem.'' But after each tragedy we get the same excuse, the same flutter of activity. Things die down for a while, and we are told again that we should wait. It is also troubling to me that we learn the names of these little towns in Bosnia and witness the tragedy, and then a few days later we do not even remember where the last tragedy occurred. But we are still told, ``Wait a little longer; wait until a few more towns go down the tubes.'' It has been 30 months. How can someone talking in any way that would be considered straight say that we have to wait longer? How many times must U.S. Senators speak until the message gets through? I just had my staff tally up how many speeches have been given on this subject since 1993. Just in the U.S. Senate alone, there were 210 speeches by Senators. "", 'Almost, I ', ""say, the vast majority of them were in favor of lifting the arms embargo. Mr. President, what are we waiting for? Are we waiting for perfect weather conditions? This is not a moon shot. This is an ongoing, horrible tragedy. And anyone can construct a reason why we should wait. But you cannot wait any longer when you witness every day on the television what can only be described as genocide. What about this second argument, this mantra, ``This is going to Americanize the war''? This one really bothers me. It is a slogan. People say we are committed, we are obligated to send 25,000 ground troops into Bosnia if we lift the arms embargo. When do we vote on that? When did Congress authorize 25,000 troops going into Bosnia? Under my view of the law and the Constitution, the Chair and I should have had a chance to vote on that. We did not do it. We did not make that commitment. And again, it is the ultimate in double speak to suggest that giving people the right to defend themselves is the thing that will cause us to have to go and defend them. That is what we are being told, that somehow giving them some guns or making sure they can buy some guns is the way to guarantee that all the rest of us would have to go over there and get involved. That is just nonsense. It is the opposite. Lifting the arms embargo is the best way to ensure that American men and women will not have to spill their blood. This is a lesson that the State of Israel has understood very well since 1948. The one thing that Israel always said is, ``We want help in terms of arms, logistical help, but we do not want American men and women to come here and fight on our soil.'' We always appreciated that sentiment, but it is not just to be nice. It is because the Israelis know that if we send troops onto Israeli soil and American men and women die, the obvious result will be probably a reduction in American support for that effort. That it will turn people off. They will say, ``Why help Israel?'' All you have to do is reference Somalia. It is exactly what happened in Somalia. People had compassion. They cared about the people in Somalia. They wanted to help them eat. But when it came to American men and women dying, they really had to question whether we could police the entire world. Well, the Bosnians understand this. And that is why they are sincere when they say that they did not want our troops. They want some help or at least not have us prevent them from getting the arms to defend themselves. Why can we as a nation say in some instances, ``This we can do. We can do no more. But we will do this.''? We do not want to police this situation. The American people will not support this as the absolute core of our national security. We probably are not ready to say in the case of Bosnia that we will bear any burden. But we are ready to do something as a people. We do want the Bosnians to be free. We do want them to be able to turn back Serbian aggression. So, Mr. President, this is the opposite of the Americanization of the war. This is how Bosnia determines its own destiny. Mr. President, maybe what has bothered me even more than these more convenient arguments is my problem with the position that the administration has taken when it says over and over again, ``We support lifting the arms embargo, but only multilaterally.'' But they are against unilateral lifting. And time and time again there have been statements from the administration indicating support, not for unilateral but for multilateral lifting of the arms embargo. A relatively recent example was March 20, 1995, where Mr. Richard Holbrooke stated: Only a negotiated settlement has any chance of lasting. This administration is committed to pursuing that goal. What we must not do is worsen the situation by unilaterally lifting the arms embargo. We have always believed the embargo is unfair and worked to end it multilaterally. This has consistently been the statement of the administration. They oppose unilateral, but they are for the multilateral lifting of the arms embargo. But usually when you look at the actual reasons why they are against the unilateral lift, they are just as true of the multilateral lift. Again, it is halfhearted arguments to justify a policy. "", 'And I ', 'know why the administration wants to do this. It is not a bad reason. They do not want to break faith with their allies, the British and the French, in particular, and even our relationship with the Russians, who do not want us [[', 'Page S ', '10327]] to lift the arms embargo. That is the real reason. What they say is they are for lifting the arms embargo if only they could get the French and the British to go along. Well, Mr. President, it does not hold up. For example, they say if you lift the arms embargo unilaterally, the allied troops will be in danger. Well, what is going on right now? Multilateral action there. And my figures indicate May 28, 377 peacekeepers taken hostage. Just last week at Srebrenica, the attack on the Dutch peacekeepers. The fact is that under either scenario, unilateral or multilateral, these folks are in danger. They are in danger now, and they would be then. At least if the Bosnians were properly armed, maybe those Serbians who like to go into the safe havens and attack peacekeepers and civilians would think twice if they knew there was a force to oppose them, not just a bunch of U.N. peacekeepers who are not allowed to do anything about them. Second, it is said that a unilateral lift would upset the Russians. My feeling about that is that that is a completely disingenuous argument because everyone knows the Russians can veto a multilateral lifting request. So the administration knows that is not going to happen. And certainly the Russians did not pay any attention to our feelings about this type of issue when they did their actions in ', 'Chechnya. A ', 'third argument is, if you lift the arms embargo, the Serbians will get arms too. Well, they may. But the fact is, they are already very well armed. They were the beneficiaries of the fifth largest stockpile of arms in all of Europe because of this foolish arms embargo. How would this be different with a multilateral lift? Surely, if there is a multilateral lift and the Serbians want to get more arms, they will get it that way just as they will with the unilateral lifting of the arms embargo. Finally, the incredible claim that under the unilateral lifting, the war will spread, and to somehow suggest that the war will not spread if we have a multi-lifting of the arms embargo. Why? Why is that the case? Surely it would spread either way to some extent. ', 'So I ', 'do not understand how the administration can claim that there is a difference between unilateral and multilateral. And that is deeply troubling to me. I think the administration simply opposes lifting the arms embargo and should be straightforward about it so that the Bosnian people and the Members of Congress could know where they really stand. So, Mr. President, why? Why have we been subjected to this avalanche of arguments, this manufacturing of arguments to stop lifting the arms embargo? It is to block the lifting of the arms embargo, obviously. ', 'But I ', 'think it is a symptom of what I like to call the all-or-nothing attitude about the military role of the United States in this world. Either we have to do everything, that our credibility says that if we do one thing we have to send in troops later on or our credibility is shot. I do not buy that. In some cases that may be true. In an alliance with ', 'NATO,', ' you bet. That is the pledge. But America cannot and certainly has not signed on to the notion that every time we help somebody do something to defend themselves, we therefore have to commit the entire force of our country. That is not the case. ', 'And I ', ""do not think it is what the Bosnian people expect. What is our end game? Are we going to just defend Bosnia and somehow broker a peace agreement and then leave this morsel of a country with no defense, to do what? Are we going to have a permanent U.N. force there? Are we just going to leave someday and hope the Serbians are nice to them? There is a better scenario, and that scenario is, let these folks continue to learn to defend themselves, to actually defend themselves, to have the pride of having protected their nation. You know, that is how we got started. That is how Israel got started in 1948, and it made all the difference that they won their own freedom. Yes, maybe with other people's arms but with their own strength and courage--and, of course, sacrifice. What is our plan? To make Bosnia one big safe-haven forever? A country that is going to be free has to be able to defend itself and it has to know how to defend itself. And you need arms in order to do that. Mr. "", 'President, I ', 'think lifting the arms embargo is the key to the permanent freedom of Bosnia. Finally, Mr. President, the question for me more than anything else is, where did anyone get the idea that we have the right to stand in the way of a self-defense of a free people that we have recognized as an independent country? What did we do in 1776? We were not even free. We were supposedly pledged in loyalty to the King of England. We decided we wanted to make our own self-determination.

52,"REPUBLICAN PLAN Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, while I was presiding, I was desirous of responding to some of the things that had been said about the subject of this morning's business by a number of the Members of the Congress, specifically one from North Dakota. During the course of his remarks, he talked about a plan, about the fact that the Republicans have talked about the plan that we had that we are going to discuss, that we have sent to the President that will reach a balanced budget in a period of 7 years, as if somebody else had a plan. I suggest that there is no other plan. If there is a plan, I have not seen it. The Senator was talking about repeating some of the things that had been said over and over again having to do with reducing Medicare in order to give tax breaks to the rich. I want to say, every time I hear that, that the Republicans had no intention at any point of reducing Medicare. The Republicans gave a program that would have the effect of increasing Medicare by approximately 6.4 percent each year. That would be if a person were getting the maximum Medicare, as accorded today under the current law. That person would receive $4,800 a year. At the end of the 7-year period, that same individual would be getting $6,700 a year. There is no way to say that that could be considered as a cut in Medicare. To say over and over and over again, with redundancy that is unbearable, that the Republicans are going to try to use cuts in Medicare--which I just talked about, that there are no cuts in Medicare--to give tax breaks to the rich is being unreasonable. Mr. President, 90 percent of the tax breaks that would come from a $500 tax credit per child would go to families under $100,000 of income. But I want to get down to the point where he was talking about our Nation's defense. He was talking about the Senate bill that was too high, talking about the appropriations bill that was actually some $7 billion more than asked for by the military. I think we all know, being realistic, that when there is a Democrat in the White House, the military is going to be influenced by what that Democrat or a Republican in the White House might want. We saw what happened back in the 1970's when we had a Democratic President in Jimmy Carter, and we saw our defense budget going down, going down and, of course, the social programs going up. Until such time as 1980, we did not have enough money for spare parts, and we found it necessary after 1980, up to 1985, to increase spending on defense by about 40 percent. We do not want that to happen again, and yet we have seen during the course of this administration cuts in our defense budget to the extent that right now we are where we were in 1980. This concerns me, because right now there is a crisis that is taking place and a decision that has been made by this President to send up to 25,000 troops on to the ground in Bosnia. You can talk about doing this and act like the budget is going to remain static during this time, and yet the foreign policy of this administration has put more and more money into humanitarian gestures, Mr. President, to the extent that he has had to come back to this Congress for emergency supplementals. This is the position we have found ourselves in: We have a Republican-elected House and Senate. We have control. The Republicans gained control in the 1994 elections. And yet we have a President who sends our troops off on humanitarian missions, having no relativity to our Nation's defense. We sent them off to Somalia. Of course, our troops went to Somalia in December under the last month of the Bush administration. And yet, once that humanitarian mission, as described by President Bush when we sent the troops over to Somalia, was over, we time and time again pleaded with President Clinton to bring our troops back from Somalia. There was no mission there that related to our Nation's security interests. Yet, he did not bring them back and they did not come back until 18 of our troops were murdered in cold blood and dragged through the mud through the streets of Mogadishu. [[Page S 16974]] What we do not want to happen in Bosnia--if you look at what the administration has done to our military--is for them to come back and say we need another billion dollars. They came back for a $1.4 billion emergency supplemental just to cover these humanitarian missions in places like Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, and other places. And we are in a position where we did not have a voice in making the decision to spend that money on humanitarian missions, money we have to borrow from future generations, because we are borrowing this money. Yet, we cannot deny the President his request for emergency supplementals, because if we do that, he will take it out of the operating account of our existing military, and, of course, we are down now to a bare bones military system. I think what is happening right now in Bosnia has a far greater significance than what we have been talking about in just the cost. I had occasion to spend 6 months in Bosnia. I did it all in 4 days. It was the most miserable 4 days I ever spent. But I learned something while I was there. I looked around and I saw a country that had been pounded and pounded. Yet, we are not real sure who is doing the pounding all that time. We have three warring factions in Bosnia. We have the Croats, the Bosnian Serbs, the Bosnian Moslems. Yet, while the peace talks are going on, I suggest to you that some of the parties causing the problems over in Bosnia are not at the peace table. So here we are faced with a dilemma where we are going to have to make decisions as to what is taking place over there, and we are going to try to stop the President from sending 25,000 ground troops in there where, certainly, there will be many, many deaths. I will wind this up by only repeating the words of the commander of the U.N. forces in Bosnia, that British general, Gen. Michael Rose, who said, ``If the Americans send troops into Bosnia, they will sustain more losses than they did during the Persian Gulf war.'' That was 390 losses. I remember when I asked Secretary Christopher and Secretary Perry, ``Is whatever we are doing over in Bosnia significant enough-- whatever mission that is--for the loss of several hundred--specifically over 400--American lives?'' They said, ``Yes.'' So I think there is the basis of the difference of opinion. Is the mission of containing a civil war and of protecting the integrity of NATO worth several hundred American lives. I say, ``no.'' That is another debate that is going on now. I would like to advise the President that it is my intention to introduce legislation that is going to make it more difficult for him to send troops into Bosnia on the ground. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, while I was presiding, I was desirous of responding to some of the things that had been said about the subject of this morning's business by a number of the Members of the Congress, specifically one from North Dakota. During the course of his remarks, he talked about a plan, about the fact that the Republicans have talked about the plan that we had that we are going to discuss, that we have sent to the President that will reach a balanced budget in a period of 7 years, as if somebody else had a plan. I suggest that there is no other plan. If there is a plan, I have not seen it. The Senator was talking about repeating some of the things that had been said over and over again having to do with reducing Medicare in order to give tax breaks to the rich. I want to say, every time I hear that, that the Republicans had no intention at any point of reducing Medicare. The Republicans gave a program that would have the effect of increasing Medicare by approximately 6.4 percent each year. That would be if a person were getting the maximum Medicare, as accorded today under the current law. That person would receive $4,800 a year. At the end of the 7-year period, that same individual would be getting $6,700 a year. There is no way to say that that could be considered as a cut in Medicare. To say over and over and over again, with redundancy that is unbearable, that the Republicans are going to try to use cuts in Medicare--which I just talked about, that there are no cuts in Medicare--to give tax breaks to the rich is being unreasonable. Mr. President, 90 percent of the tax breaks that would come from a $500 tax credit per child would go to families under $100,000 of income. But I want to get down to the point where he was talking about our Nation's defense. He was talking about the Senate bill that was too high, talking about the appropriations bill that was actually some $7 billion more than asked for by the military. I think we all know, being realistic, that when there is a Democrat in the White House, the military is going to be influenced by what that Democrat or a Republican in the White House might want. We saw what happened back in the 1970's when we had a Democratic President in Jimmy Carter, and we saw our defense budget going down, going down and, of course, the social programs going up. Until such time as 1980, we did not have enough money for spare parts, and we found it necessary after 1980, up to 1985, to increase spending on defense by about 40 percent. We do not want that to happen again, and yet we have seen during the course of this administration cuts in our defense budget to the extent that right now we are where we were in 1980. This concerns me, because right now there is a crisis that is taking place and a decision that has been made by this President to send up to 25,000 troops on to the ground in Bosnia. You can talk about doing this and act like the budget is going to remain static during this time, and yet the foreign policy of this administration has put more and more money into humanitarian gestures, Mr. President, to the extent that he has had to come back to this Congress for emergency supplementals. This is the position we have found ourselves in: We have a Republican-elected House and Senate. We have control. The Republicans gained control in the 1994 elections. And yet we have a President who sends our troops off on humanitarian missions, having no relativity to our Nation's defense. We sent them off to Somalia. Of course, our troops went to Somalia in December under the last month of the Bush administration. And yet, once that humanitarian mission, as described by President Bush when we sent the troops over to Somalia, was over, we time and time again pleaded with President Clinton to bring our troops back from Somalia. There was no mission there that related to our Nation's security interests. Yet, he did not bring them back and they did not come back until 18 of our troops were murdered in cold blood and dragged through the mud through the streets of Mogadishu. [[Page S 16974]] What we do not want to happen in Bosnia--if you look at what the administration has done to our military--is for them to come back and say we need another billion dollars. They came back for a $1.4 billion emergency supplemental just to cover these humanitarian missions in places like Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, and other places. And we are in a position where we did not have a voice in making the decision to spend that money on humanitarian missions, money we have to borrow from future generations, because we are borrowing this money. Yet, we cannot deny the President his request for emergency supplementals, because if we do that, he will take it out of the operating account of our existing military, and, of course, we are down now to a bare bones military system. I think what is happening right now in Bosnia has a far greater significance than what we have been talking about in just the cost. I had occasion to spend 6 months in Bosnia. I did it all in 4 days. It was the most miserable 4 days I ever spent. But I learned something while I was there. I looked around and I saw a country that had been pounded and pounded. Yet, we are not real sure who is doing the pounding all that time. We have three warring factions in Bosnia. We have the Croats, the Bosnian Serbs, the Bosnian Moslems.

53,"SLOVENIA: A MODEL FOR EASTERN EUROPE ______ HON. JAMES L. OBERSTAR of minnesota in the house of representatives Tuesday, May 9, 1995 Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, on February 16 I stood on the floor of this House, during debate on the NATO expansion bill, and asked that any efforts to bring Eastern Europe into the Western community not ignore the former Yugoslav Republic of Slovenia. A country of just over 2 million people, independent for less than 4 years, Slovenia has successfully thrown off the economic shackles of the Socialist Yugoslav system and is leading the newly emergent countries of Eastern Europe and the Balkan States in conversion to a free and open market economy. In per capita terms, Slovenia is the 20th largest exporter in the world, exporting over $7 billion in goods each year, which accounts for 60 percent of Slovenia's GNP. Slovenia now enjoys a lively trade with the United States, shipping $229 million worth of goods to the United States each year and importing some $180 million in United States goods annually. It is with great pride, then, Mr. Speaker, as a Slovenian-American, that I return to the floor today to bring my colleagues more accolades over Slovenia's accomplishments. This time, the praise comes from none less than the Journal of Commerce, which headlined an April 6 editorial ``A Model for Eastern Europe.'' I commend this article to my colleagues and to the leadership of our various executive branch departments. I ask that you remember to include Slovenia and its hard working, enterprising people when making decisions on our country's future relationship with the transitional economies and governments which have replaced the former Communist regimes of Eastern and central- southeastern Europe. [From the Journal of Commerce, April 6, 1995] A Model for Eastern Europe (By Timothy Ashby) Eastern Europe has had its share of bad news recently. Painful economic reforms and factional strife in Russia, political turmoil in Poland, continuing ethnic warfare in parts of former Yugoslavia--all have made Western businessmen cautious about trade and investment in the region. Yet one small country, Slovenia, has emerged as an economic and political model for the old socialist bloc. Slovenia's accomplishments over the past year read like a wish list for its neighbors. 1994 exports were more than 14% greater than the previous year, and now account for 60.4% of gross domestic product. Manufacturing production increased 6.8% last year while unemployment fell 1.5%. The tolar, Slovenia's national currency, appreciated 11% against the deutsche mark in 1994. The country has a very low debt service ratio of only 5.5%. At $6,957, Slovenia has the highest GDP per head of all former socialist bloc republics in Eastern Europe, nearly twice that of the Czech Republic. GDP grew more than 5% in 1994 and the country enjoyed a healthy current account surplus of $2.6 billion at the end of last year. Foreigners made direct investments of $72.3 million last year. Three factors account for Slovenia's success. The first is its geographical location. Lying at the crossroads of Western and Eastern Europe, Slovenia borders European Union members Italy on the west, Austria on its northern border, Hungary to the northeast and the Republic of Croatia to the east and south. Slovenia also has a coast on the Adriatic Sea, where the major Port of Koper serves as a gateway for international seaborne trade with all of Central Europe. The second factor is political stability. Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek presides over a Western European-style coalition government. Slovenia is a healthy young democracy, with parties in its Parliament running the gamut from Christian Democrats and Greens to reformist communists. Despite rivalry between the parties, an unusually high degree of consensus over economic policy has been achieved, a fact foreign investors find reassuring. All sides are committed to the transformation to a Western-style market economy, but also to maintaining a strong social safety net and to forcing money-losing state enterprises to become competitive in the private sector. Slovenia's carefully conceived strategy for creating a modern free market economy is the third reason for its success. The government has adopted a gradualist approach to economic restructuring, striking a pragmatic middle ground between the Czech Republic's shock therapy methods and the meandering reforms undertaken by some former Soviet republics. To lessen the political and social impact of widespread redundancies, privatization has been undertaken at a slower pace than in other former socialist countries. The government occasionally intervenes and provides help to ailing companies by guaranteeing finance-for-debt rescheduling in return for moderation in dividend distribution and wage increases. By the end of 1994, a quarter of all Slovenia's state-owned enterprises had been privatized. The process will be accelerated during 1995 to achieve the goal of placing 50% to 65% of public assets in private hands. Preference is given to privitization via management and employee buyouts. While initially criticized by some as a method that would do little to attract foreign capital and technology, many privatized companies have established joint ventures both domestically and internationally. As a result, Slovenia has not suffered from a lack of investment in new plant and capital equipment. Domestic savings play a major role in the modernization of Slovenia's industrial sector. The growth in all areas of demand has stimulated a continuous expansion in industrial capacity. Much of this is fueled by the capital city's Ljubljana Stock Exchange, which together with the rest of the private financial services sector contributes 3.2% of the country's GDP. Slovenia's growing number of financial institutions, as well as its beautiful Alpine landscape, justify its nickname, ``the Switzerland of Eastern Europe.'' Compared to many of its neighbors, where red tape can seriously impede foreign direct investment, Slovenia has implemented one of the least restrictive investment climates in Eastern Europe. Foreign investments in any form enjoy full national treatment--that is, they have the same status as Slovene legal entities. All sectors of the economy are open to foreigners operating through joint ventures. Legal entities established and registered in Slovenia, even if they have 100% foreign ownership, may own real estate. The Slovenian Parliament is considering legislation to change real estate and other business-related laws to harmonize them with the EU. With a 30% flat tax on corporate profits, Slovenia has one of the lowest tax burdens in Europe. The tax rate is further reduced to 20% in the case of reinvestment, which actually lowers the tax rate to 24%. All foreign investors are guaranteed free transfer of profits and repatriation of invested capital, while no restrictions are placed on foreign shareholders in Slovene enterprises who want to transfer their profits abroad in foreign currency. Germany, Austria and Italy now account for 65.9% of all Slovenian foreign investment. Businessmen in these countries see great profit potential in Slovenia because of its proximity to major markets, its political stability and the high probability that it will become an early member of both the European Union and NATO. U.S. businesses, which account for less than 1% of FDI in Slovenia, have not yet awakened to these investment opportunities. Even Australia, which contributed 2.3% of the country's foreign direct investment in 1994, invested more in Slovenia--with a population of only 2 million--than in giant but strife-torn Russia. Slovenia's lesson for other developing countries is that political and economic stability can only be attained by a true commitment to democracy and the creation of a free market. As Slovenia rapidly approaches the time when it will be ready for membership in the European Union and NATO, its eastern and western neighbors can point to it as an example of one of the world's great success stories.

Lying at the crossroads of Western and Eastern Europe, Slovenia borders European Union members Italy on the west, Austria on its northern border, Hungary to the northeast and the Republic of Croatia to the east and south. Slovenia also has a coast on the Adriatic Sea, where the major Port of Koper serves as a gateway for international seaborne trade with all of Central Europe. The second factor is political stability. Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek presides over a Western European-style coalition government. Slovenia is a healthy young democracy, with parties in its Parliament running the gamut from Christian Democrats and Greens to reformist communists. Despite rivalry between the parties, an unusually high degree of consensus over economic policy has been achieved, a fact foreign investors find reassuring. All sides are committed to the transformation to a Western-style market economy, but also to maintaining a strong social safety net and to forcing money-losing state enterprises to become competitive in the private sector. Slovenia's carefully conceived strategy for creating a modern free market economy is the third reason for its success. The government has adopted a gradualist approach to economic restructuring, striking a pragmatic middle ground between the Czech Republic's shock therapy methods and the meandering reforms undertaken by some former Soviet republics. To lessen the political and social impact of widespread redundancies, privatization has been undertaken at a slower pace than in other former socialist countries. The government occasionally intervenes and provides help to ailing companies by guaranteeing finance-for-debt rescheduling in return for moderation in dividend distribution and wage increases. By the end of 1994, a quarter of all Slovenia's state-owned enterprises had been privatized. The process will be accelerated during 1995 to achieve the goal of placing 50% to 65% of public assets in private hands. Preference is given to privitization via management and employee buyouts. While initially criticized by some as a method that would do little to attract foreign capital and technology, many privatized companies have established joint ventures both domestically and internationally. As a result, Slovenia has not suffered from a lack of investment in new plant and capital equipment. Domestic savings play a major role in the modernization of Slovenia's industrial sector. The growth in all areas of demand has stimulated a continuous expansion in industrial capacity. Much of this is fueled by the capital city's Ljubljana Stock Exchange, which together with the rest of the private financial services sector contributes 3.2% of the country's GDP. Slovenia's growing number of financial institutions, as well as its beautiful Alpine landscape, justify its nickname, ``the Switzerland of Eastern Europe.'' Compared to many of its neighbors, where red tape can seriously impede foreign direct investment, Slovenia has implemented one of the least restrictive investment climates in Eastern Europe. Foreign investments in any form enjoy full national treatment--that is, they have the same status as Slovene legal entities. All sectors of the economy are open to foreigners operating through joint ventures. Legal entities established and registered in Slovenia, even if they have 100% foreign ownership, may own real estate. The Slovenian Parliament is considering legislation to change real estate and other business-related laws to harmonize them with the EU. With a 30% flat tax on corporate profits, Slovenia has one of the lowest tax burdens in Europe. The tax rate is further reduced to 20% in the case of reinvestment, which actually lowers the tax rate to 24%. All foreign investors are guaranteed free transfer of profits and repatriation of invested capital, while no restrictions are placed on foreign shareholders in Slovene enterprises who want to transfer their profits abroad in foreign currency. Germany, Austria and Italy now account for 65.9% of all Slovenian foreign investment. Businessmen in these countries see great profit potential in Slovenia because of its proximity to major markets, its political stability and the high probability that it will become an early member of both the European Union and "", 'NATO. U.', ""S. businesses, which account for less than 1% of FDI in Slovenia, have not yet awakened to these investment opportunities. Even Australia, which contributed 2.3% of the country's foreign direct investment in 1994, invested more in Slovenia--with a population of only 2 million--than in giant but strife-torn Russia. Slovenia's lesson for other developing countries is that political and economic stability can only be attained by a true commitment to democracy and the creation of a free market. As Slovenia rapidly approaches the time when it will be ready for membership in the European Union and "", 'NATO,', "" its eastern and western neighbors can point to it as an example of one of the world's great success stories.

54,"PEACE TALKS IN DAYTON Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, there are news reporters indicating that the administration is trying to wrap up peace talks in Dayton, OH, by tomorrow morning. No doubt about it, the administration has put a great deal of effort into this diplomatic process. A significant number of our diplomats have been working around the clock to get an agreement. Their hard work should be recognized. However, I hope that in their understandable haste, our negotiators will not lose sight of the objective--which is not just to secure a peace, but to secure a just and lasting peace. Most Members of Congress would agree that for an agreement to have a reasonable prospect of achieving a stable peace, it must include the following provisions: First, a clear demarcation of defensible borders for Bosnia and Herzegovina and resolution of all territorial issues among the parties; Second, clear lines of demarcation between the military forces of the parties to the agreement and procedures for separating the forces; Third, concurrence by all parties and witnesses to the agreement to multilateral lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina upon entry into force of the agreement; Fourth, acceptance by all parties and witnesses to the agreement to United States involvement in an effort to equip, arm, and train Bosnian Federation Forces; Fifth, establishment of clear standards for violations of the agreement and the unrestricted use of force by NATO to include air power as necessary to respond to violations of the agreement which threaten not only the peace, but the security of our forces; Sixth, an end to military intervention by the Governments of Croatia and Serbia and Montenegro in Bosnia and Herzegovina; Seventh, the dismantlement of the integrated air defense network linkages between Serbia and Bosnian-Serb held areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina; Eighth, full NATO implementation of the deny flight operation; and Ninth, measures to ensure that indicted war criminals are not in positions of authority, including any elected office. Mr. President, it seems to me that these are the minimum elements of a viable peace agreement. Without these elements, it is unlikely that a genuine peace will hold. Without these elements, it is unlikely that Bosnia will survive. We should not mistake securing any peace agreement in Dayton with securing a stable peace. No matter how difficult the negotiations are, if they fail to achieve an agreement that secures the integrity and independence of Bosnia they will have been a waste of time. Also essential to a stable peace is restoring public confidence and trust in the Government, institutions, and leaders of Bosnia. Absent justice, there will be no trust and no peace will endure. For the long- suffering Bosnian people, to believe in the peace, they [[Page S 17483]] must witness for themselves that justice will be done in Bosnia. Justice is the only comfort we can provide to mothers and fathers who have lost their children to war crimes. This will not be a just peace if war criminals remain at large and unaccountable for their heinous crimes. Furthermore, Mr. President, any peace will be short-lived if it does not provide the Bosnians with the authority and the means to defend their territory and their people. Absent a stable military balance, those who have clearly been the aggressors in this conflict will seek to press their advantage again. Whatever agreement is initialed in Dayton, it must provide for lifting the arms embargo and for addressing the existing military imbalance. If it does not, it will serve no greater purpose than to delay an inevitable return to hostilities. It will simply be another invitation to future aggression. Placing these important matters aside, foremost on the minds of the American people is whether or not young Americans should be ordered to enforce a peace agreement in Bosnia. Mr. President, in my view, the deployment of American forces into harms' way requires very careful deliberation on the part of the administration and the Congress. The President has informed me that he will come to Congress for support. That is the right thing to do. It would be unwise to send American forces without the support of the Congress and the American people. Right now, I do not believe that the President has it. He certainly will not have it, if a peace agreement does not include the provisions I have mentioned. But, he is also unlikely to receive our support if the implementation plan for our military forces does not, at the very least, include the following essential provisions: First, well-defined and clearly stated mission objectives achievable through military means; Second, robust rules of engagement allowing for disproportionate responses, as appropriate, to any attacks on United States and NATO forces and no restrictions or impediments on the ability of United States and NATO military forces to defend themselves; Third, United States military forces will operate only under a unified NATO command whose orders and authority cannot be constrained, conditioned, blocked or vetoed by any other party including the United Nations; Fourth, United States military forces shall use the authority granted in any annexes to the maximum extent consistent with their resources and shall act to deter, defeat or punish any violations from whatever source; Fifth, clear criteria for measuring progress toward achieving the objectives of the operation, a detailed exit strategy, and adequate resources for achieving these objectives and effecting a safe exit for all United States forces from Bosnia; Sixth, procedures for integrating appropriate UNPROFOR forces currently in Bosnia into a NATO-led implementation force and procedures for withdrawing any other UNPROFOR forces from Bosnia; and Seventh, specific provisions to prevent conflict between United States and non-NATO Forces and members of the civilian population of Bosnia. Mr. President, I believe that these criteria are very simple and very basic. I am not certain that Congress will go along with sending American Forces even if these provisions are included in a peace agreement and implementation plan. However, I am certain that without these elements, not only will Congress overwhelmingly disapprove of the peace agreement and the plan to send American Forces as peacekeepers, but that neither of these plans will have a chance of succeeding. The administration says that NATO will collapse if the United States does not send Americans into Bosnia as peacekeepers, but what happens to NATO if Americans are used to keep a peace which cannot be kept? What happens if we send Americans without adequate authority and provision to protect themselves? NATO should remain strong and united, however, unity in failure is the worst possible outcome. How much worse off would NATO be if United States and other NATO Forces were deployed in Bosnia only to leave in failure? Which brings me to my final question: Why this option? Why is sending 20,000 American troops to Bosnia the only option being considered by the Clinton administration? Why was no consideration given to using American air power and American supply lines for ground forces provided by our European allies? Mr. President, many questions remain. The President has not yet made the case for American involvement in Bosnia on this massive scale. The Congress has clearly stated its view that the President should seek authorization for any deployment to Bosnia. The Congress has also clearly stated its preference for lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia so that Bosnians may defend themselves. And we have done this time after time after time on a bipartisan basis. Many of us who supported lifting the embargo, did so not just because of our support for Bosnia's inherent right to self-defense, because we hoped we could avoid sending thousands of Americans into Bosnia to defend Bosnians. But, the President chose not to do that--and now we are where we are. Mr. President, we fully understand the constitutional authority of the President of the United States. We also understand the constitutional responsibility of the Congress. There is no greater responsibility for an elected representative than to prevent the needles shedding of American blood. We intend to exercise that responsibility with the utmost care. Mr. President, I want to particularly thank the Presiding Officer for his efforts not only in helping me prepare this statement, but for his consistent support for the position that I have outlined here and for his leadership on the Senate floor and in the Senate negotiations on both sides of the aisle. I appreciate very much his help. Mr. WARNER.

55,"SENDING TROOPS TO BOSNIA Mr. THOMAS. I rise, Mr. President, to talk about Bosnia, to talk about the thing that, I guess, is before all of us as American citizens--decisions, some of which, unfortunately, have apparently already been made, but the major decisions are still to be made. I have thought a lot about this tragedy, as most of us have. Certainly, it has been before us almost nightly on TV, a great deal of discussion about it: some 43 months of war, over 200,000 people killed, a real human tragedy, of course. All of us feel badly about that. I have also had the opportunity to travel there recently. About a month ago, seven of us from the Senate had a chance to go there. I must tell you, I came back no more convinced that we have a role there with ground troops than I did before I left. I think the idea of inserting 20,000 ground troops is a mistake. There are a number of questions that, I think, the answers to which lead to that conclusion. The basic one, of course, is: What is the national interest? I think that question needs to be asked in each of the kinds of commitments we make--major commitments, particularly of Armed Forces. What is our role throughout the world? There are many places in which there is unrest and tragedy, and there are a number of places in which there is civil war. Is it in our national interest to intercede in each of those, to send 10,000 troops, 20,000 troops? I do not know the answer. But I think not. I do not think it is in our national interest to be the policeman of the world in civil uprisings such as this. I guess we have to ask ourselves, are we to police regional peace throughout the world wherever it is threatened? Do we have an obligation to secure regional peace throughout the world by sending our troops into these kinds of situations? What is the national interest? What kind of national interest does deserve military attention? I think this is the basic issue. All of the other things we talk about are pretty secondary to that. The President, of course, has not been able to lay out convincingly that interdiction and involvement of 20,000 or 25,000 U.S. troops is indeed in our national interest. Let us examine some of the administration's concerns and arguments. They have been here in our Committee of Foreign Relations. We had a hearing with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, as well as the Joint Chiefs of Staff. One of the arguments is that killing is morally wrong. Of course, we all agree with that. But then should we send troops wherever that occurs? Should we be involved each time killing occurs? I think we would be overwhelmed by the number of times that we would saddle up and go to Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, and endless other places, if killing is in fact the issue of national interest that promotes the sending of 25,000 troops. We hear that the conflict will expand. Frankly, I have to tell you that I do not believe that is nearly as imperative as it was 43 months ago. My impression, frankly, from being there--and I was only there 4 days, so I am not an expert by any means --as you would imagine, these people are very tired of fighting. They are looking for solutions themselves, as you would imagine they would be. The notion that this is going to expand now if we do not move 25,000 troops in I do not believe is a basis in fact. We were there going down the street of Sarajevo, and they point out, almost with pride, that there is the bridge where the Grand Duke was shot before the start of World War I. Really, that adds very little to today's expansion of another war. But if you want to look at historic things, in that country, the guerrillas, during World War II, were never chased down. They never surrendered. In that country, in the mountains, these kinds of troops will go on forever, if they choose to. Another is that if we do not intercede at this level, we will then be isolationists in the world and we would be withdrawing from our role of leadership. I cannot imagine that argument, as involved as we are around the world, both in troops, commerce, and trade, and we are involved in all of the organizations that have to do with security, trade, and with the development of international relations. We are isolationists? Give me a break. That is hardly what our activities can be called. It seems to me that the principal reason the President is pushing as hard as he is, is that 2 years ago, he indicated we would send 25,000 troops. Now it is 20,000. Why not 10,000? Why not 15,000? We spent 4 days there. The first day was with the Unified European Command. I must tell you, I was very proud, as always, of the American troops, who are training to be part of this undertaking. But at that time, they were talking about 25,000 American troops, talking about a total of 90,000 NATO troops, with another 15,000 already there--over 110,000 troops in this area. The Senator from South Carolina just spoke about the agreement. I guess I have to say that if the agreement is one that is agreed to by the warring parties--genuinely agreed to--then you could say, why do you need 90,000 troops to enforce it? If it is not agreed to, then the Secretary of Defense, and others, said we should not be there. You have to fight your way in. If you have to fight to make peace, then that is not our mission. That has been made clear that we will not be there. So there has to be an agreement that has genuine accord. We will see. I hope there is. I think the United States and the State Department have done a great job in bringing together these people to some kind of a peace agreement. Why is it so important that we have to define the national interest? You hear a lot about being concerned, as we [[Page S 17525]] should be, with putting troops in harm's way. Frankly, often troops are in harm's way. That is what troops are for. The issue is not harm's way; the issue is why they are there. If the troops are there with a bona fide national interest, then we try to avoid harm's way. But that is not the criteria. The cost. When you talk about $1 billion, $2 billion, I think we spent that much in Haiti. Can you imagine that this will cost less than Haiti? I do not believe so. Is it in the national interest to spend $3 billion, $4 billion? That is a question. Maybe more important than anything was the lack of specific goals. In the hearing that I mentioned with the Joint Chiefs, the general said we will get the job done. I believe that. I believe our Armed Forces will get the job done. I ask, how will you know? What is the job that is to be done? Frankly, I do not think anyone knows precisely. Pull out in 1 year? I have a hunch that is a little bit political, that the notion is that we know you cannot leave troops there very long. What if you are not through in a year? How do you know you are through? What is it that signifies having the job done? We were very concerned when we talked to the command. What do you do in this zone? Do you have check points with half a dozen soldiers--I do not know-- that are subject to raids by small bands? Do you put them in large groups and patrol? The notion was, if you are fired on, you get to fire back. That is right, the way it ought to be. It was also, if there is an attack, we should withdraw because we are not there to fight but to keep peace. If there is no peace we would not be there. Sort of a conundrum. So, Mr. President, it seems to me that it is an almost unsolvable situation. I think we can be involved. I think people want us to be involved. I think we indeed have been involved. The question of 20,000 troops is quite a different matter. I have to say, in the time I was in Wyoming, I really did not find anyone who supported that idea. So we have a situation of 43 months of war in the former Yugoslavia, more than 250,000 people killed, an ethnic war, a continuation of something that has gone on a very long time. The question is, do we place ourselves in the middle of this, between the Serbs? One of the things that has happened, I believe, partly as a result of this body's taking action on lifting the arms embargo, is that we did tend to equalize the forces. Croatians and Moslems got together in the federation which sort of leveled the playing field of the Serbs, and then NATO's airstrikes completed that job. You noticed a great change in what was happening. So we are faced with an ancient ethnic and religious conflict. Frankly, it is hard to know who is on what side. Another obstacle is to overcome how you handle the United States and Russia being there at the same time. Russians will not be under the control of the NATO but still want to be in a segment. The winter is certainly a worry. I know we can handle it, but nevertheless it is tough. Mr. President, I do not believe there has been demonstrated--and quite frankly I do not believe there will be demonstrated--an indication that placement of these troops in the former Yugoslavia is in the international interests. I think that ought to be the criterion. That ought to be the measurement. In the next few weeks we will need to make that measurement. All of us need to be involved whether we are in the Senate, whether we are citizens, whether we vote. This is a U.S. decision, and it will have to be made by all. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

I rise, Mr. President, to talk about Bosnia, to talk about the thing that, I guess, is before all of us as American citizens--decisions, some of which, unfortunately, have apparently already been made, but the major decisions are still to be made. I have thought a lot about this tragedy, as most of us have. Certainly, it has been before us almost nightly on TV, a great deal of discussion about it: some 43 months of war, over 200,000 people killed, a real human tragedy, of course. All of us feel badly about that. I have also had the opportunity to travel there recently. About a month ago, seven of us from the Senate had a chance to go there. I must tell you, I came back no more convinced that we have a role there with ground troops than I did before I left. I think the idea of inserting 20,000 ground troops is a mistake. There are a number of questions that, I think, the answers to which lead to that conclusion. The basic one, of course, is: What is the national interest? I think that question needs to be asked in each of the kinds of commitments we make--major commitments, particularly of Armed Forces. What is our role throughout the world? There are many places in which there is unrest and tragedy, and there are a number of places in which there is civil war. Is it in our national interest to intercede in each of those, to send 10,000 troops, 20,000 troops? I do not know the answer. But I think not. I do not think it is in our national interest to be the policeman of the world in civil uprisings such as this. I guess we have to ask ourselves, are we to police regional peace throughout the world wherever it is threatened? Do we have an obligation to secure regional peace throughout the world by sending our troops into these kinds of situations? What is the national interest? What kind of national interest does deserve military attention? I think this is the basic issue. All of the other things we talk about are pretty secondary to that. The President, of course, has not been able to lay out convincingly that interdiction and involvement of 20,000 or 25,000 U.S. troops is indeed in our national interest. Let us examine some of the administration's concerns and arguments. They have been here in our Committee of Foreign Relations. We had a hearing with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, as well as the Joint Chiefs of Staff. One of the arguments is that killing is morally wrong. Of course, we all agree with that. But then should we send troops wherever that occurs? Should we be involved each time killing occurs? I think we would be overwhelmed by the number of times that we would saddle up and go to Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, and endless other places, if killing is in fact the issue of national interest that promotes the sending of 25,000 troops. We hear that the conflict will expand. Frankly, I have to tell you that I do not believe that is nearly as imperative as it was 43 months ago. My impression, frankly, from being there--and I was only there 4 days, so I am not an expert by any means --as you would imagine, these people are very tired of fighting. They are looking for solutions themselves, as you would imagine they would be. The notion that this is going to expand now if we do not move 25,000 troops in I do not believe is a basis in fact. We were there going down the street of Sarajevo, and they point out, almost with pride, that there is the bridge where the Grand Duke was shot before the start of World War I. Really, that adds very little to today's expansion of another war. But if you want to look at historic things, in that country, the guerrillas, during World War II, were never chased down. They never surrendered. In that country, in the mountains, these kinds of troops will go on forever, if they choose to. Another is that if we do not intercede at this level, we will then be isolationists in the world and we would be withdrawing from our role of leadership. I cannot imagine that argument, as involved as we are around the world, both in troops, commerce, and trade, and we are involved in all of the organizations that have to do with security, trade, and with the development of international relations. We are isolationists? Give me a break. That is hardly what our activities can be called. It seems to me that the principal reason the President is pushing as hard as he is, is that 2 years ago, he indicated we would send 25,000 troops. Now it is 20,000. Why not 10,000? Why not 15,000? We spent 4 days there. The first day was with the Unified European Command. I must tell you, I was very proud, as always, of the American troops, who are training to be part of this undertaking. But at that time, they were talking about 25,000 American troops, talking about a total of 90,000 NATO troops, with another 15,000 already there--over 110,000 troops in this area. The Senator from South Carolina just spoke about the agreement. I guess I have to say that if the agreement is one that is agreed to by the warring parties--genuinely agreed to--then you could say, why do you need 90,000 troops to enforce it? If it is not agreed to, then the Secretary of Defense, and others, said we should not be there. You have to fight your way in. If you have to fight to make peace, then that is not our mission. That has been made clear that we will not be there. So there has to be an agreement that has genuine accord. We will see. I hope there is. I think the United States and the State Department have done a great job in bringing together these people to some kind of a peace agreement. Why is it so important that we have to define the national interest? You hear a lot about being concerned, as we [[Page S 17525]] should be, with putting troops in harm's way. Frankly, often troops are in harm's way. That is what troops are for. The issue is not harm's way; the issue is why they are there. If the troops are there with a bona fide national interest, then we try to avoid harm's way. But that is not the criteria. The cost. When you talk about $1 billion, $2 billion, I think we spent that much in Haiti. Can you imagine that this will cost less than Haiti? I do not believe so. Is it in the national interest to spend $3 billion, $4 billion? That is a question. Maybe more important than anything was the lack of specific goals. In the hearing that I mentioned with the Joint Chiefs, the general said we will get the job done. I believe that. I believe our Armed Forces will get the job done. I ask, how will you know? What is the job that is to be done? Frankly, I do not think anyone knows precisely. Pull out in 1 year?

56,"ATROCITIES IN BOSNIA Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not know how many of my colleagues saw the picture on the front page of the New York Times this morning. It is an unusual and historic picture. When you first look at it, all you see is a group of refugees. If you look a little closer, you will see men in military uniform. Those men are part of what has been called the U.N. Protection Force. They are standing by observing men being taken out of Srebrenica who are suspected, by Bosnian Serb forces of ``war crimes,'' young women being taken out for purposes that I cannot describe, old women and children who are starving to death and being forced to walk unknown distances. Rather than describe it in my words, let me just read: In what has been a ritual of previous ``ethnic cleansing'' campaigns by the Bosnian Serbs to rid territories of Muslim populations, the Serbs who took Srebrenica separated the military-age men from the refugees and said they would be ``screened for war crimes,'' a United Nations spokesman here said. The air was filled with anguished cries as the Bosnian Serbs loaded the first 3,000 women, children and elderly . . . Mr. President, we have gone from a situation where the Europeans were supposed to be protecting people to now sitting by and watching atrocities and war crimes being perpetrated before their very eyes. And they stand by helpless. What could possibly be the effect throughout the world of scenes such as this? Mr. President, as Senator Dole said in his recent statement, it is over. It is over, Mr. President. ``It was quite a horrifying scene,'' said Steven Oberreit of Doctors Without Borders. ``There was screaming and crying and panic. They didn't know where they were being taken to.'' The refugees fled to Potocari on Tuesday night after Bosnian Serb troops swept into the town of Srebrenica, the heart of the United Nations safe area . . . Today, 1,500 Bosnian Serb troops, backed by tanks . . . overran the base with no resistance after they threatened to shell the refugees and kill the Dutch peacekeepers they were holding hostage if NATO warplanes intervened. Mr. President, we have crossed the line from danger to humiliation. We have crossed the line from attempts to do the right thing to degradation and dishonor. Mr. President, we cannot allow this to continue. And if events follow unchecked, next will be the enclave of Zepa, and then Gorazde, and next [[Page S 9880]] maybe even Sarajevo. Mr. President, it is time they got out, and it is time we helped them out, and it is time we help the Bosnian Muslims defend themselves. Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for an observation? Mr. McCAIN. Yes. Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am glad to hear the Senator on the floor speaking to this. Would the Senator acknowledge what everybody forgets? I know the Senator is angry about it, as well. I want to remind everybody that the reason why the U.N. observers are there is that the United Nations went in and disarmed--disarmed--not only did we fail to allow the Bosnian Government to get arms, the arms that existed, we went into Srebrenica--the United Nations did, with our support--and disarmed the Bosnian Government, disarmed the Muslims, disarmed the Croats, in return for a promise that we would protect them. And when, in fact, it was clear and the Dutch were called in for air strikes by NATO, Mr. Akashi said no. I want everybody to remember what the Senator from Arizona is saying here. Not only did we not protect, we affirmatively--the United Nations and the West--disarmed those safe areas, took their weapons and said, ``We promise you in return that we will keep the Serbs from the door.'' But they knocked on the door, knocked it down, and there was nothing there for them to defend themselves with. Now, as the Senator from Arizona said, they stand by and watch. And it is not the fault of those Dutch blue helmets. It is the fault of the contact group. It is the fault of the West for failing to intervene, at a minimum with air power, significant air power. But I think the Senator is absolutely correct. This is an atrocity. We should lift the embargo immediately and we should make available what, under the law, the President is allowed to do. Two years ago, this Senate and Congress passed a piece of legislation authorizing the President, in his discretion, to make available up to 50 million dollars worth of weapons off the shelf now for those people. I stood in Tuzla the last time this happened and watched trucks come into Tuzla loaded with women and children, and I thought they were celebrating when I first saw them because they were holding up children in these dump trucks above their heads. As they unloaded the dump trucks, I understood why the children were being held above their heads and held outside of the dump truck. Do you know why, Mr. President? Because when they opened the gate and got out, there were three children smothered to death in the bottom of those 1995 versions of cattle cars being dragged into Auschwitz. If these were not Moslems, the world would be reacting, just like if it were not Jews in the thirties, the world would react. Shame on the West. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be granted an additional 5 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the emotion of my friend from Delaware. I appreciate his compassion. I think the challenge before us now is to try to devise, working with the administration, a way to end this tragedy as quickly as possible for a minimum loss of human life, recognizing at this point that there are no good options. There are no good options in Bosnia today. What we need to do is choose the least bad option if we expect to stop this ongoing tragedy. The reason I pointed out this picture again--this is the first time, I think, in history we have ever seen a picture of people who are in uniform, designated as peacekeepers, standing by and watching people being ethnically cleansed, mass rape, and, of course, the arrest and probable torture of young men. That is what the U.N. Protection Force has been reduced to. That is why, in my view, this was ill-conceived and flawed from the beginning--because it was an attempt to keep peace where there was no peace. I wanted to give some facts as to how bad the situation is. Let me point out that I believe the United States should be prepared to assist in the effort to help remove the United Nations protection force and remove U.N. and allied forces from Bosnia. I want to just lay out the criteria. I hope at some time we can have a significant debate and discussion of this issue, possibly as early as next week. But I want to lay out the following criteria, because we have to be clear. The operation must be conducted under U.S. or NATO command. It must have a clear mission objective, precluding any danger of mission creep, and the operational rules of engagement must be established and approved by NATO. Under no circumstances should the United Nations be permitted to participate in any way in the planning or implementation of a withdrawal operation. To allow any U.N. influence would be to risk the same failed policies from which UNPROFOR so clearly suffers. To allow U.N. participation in command decisions would be to risk repeating the gutless refusal to destroy Serb air defenses, a U.N. decision which led to the shootdown of an American F-16 last month. Mr. President, the administration has committed 25,000 U.S. forces as part of an evacuation force. Once again, we must recognize that we must be willing to devote whatever forces in support that are necessary to successfully complete the mission--an overwhelming force to guarantee the safety of our men and women in uniform and those of our allies. Finally, Mr. President, clear warnings must be issued to all parties involved in the Bosnian conflict. Should one American be injured or killed while participating in a withdrawal operation, the United States will not hesitate to use its military might to punish such aggression. I would like to be specific. If the Bosnian Serbs harm Americans while this rescue operation is going on, I suggest the most punishing air strikes imaginable, and going as far away as Belgrade, if necessary. Mr. President, it is our obligation morally to rescue the U.N. Protection Forces. It is also our moral obligation to do everything necessary to protect the lives of our young men and women who are involved in that operation, and make the cost so extremely high that we can guarantee to a significant degree the safety of those men and women. Every day UNPROFOR stays, every hostage that is taken, every attack on the safe areas, every strategically ineffectual air strike and every sortie that has no mission but returns safely to base, creates the perception of a feeble Western alliance. Every day UNPROFOR is in place is another day that the Bosnian Government forces are precluded from protecting themselves against Serb aggression. Remove UNPROFOR, lift the arms embargo and allow the people of Bosnia to fight for their future. Unfortunately, harsh, cold, military facts will resolve this conflict. One side will prevail. I hope it is the lawful government of Bosnia. I find it very troubling that we have interfered with these realities to the benefit of the aggressor, by imposing an arms embargo on the victim. If we are unwilling to commit American forces to defend Bosnians, we cannot in good faith prevent the Bosnians from defending themselves. I want to thank Senator Dole for his proposal on this issue. I hope that next week we will take up this issue as soon as possible. Every hour that we delay, more innocent people will die. Every hour that we delay, will mean more humiliation and degradation of the United Nations and NATO. The repercussions of this kind of dishonor will reverberate around the world. We must bring it to a halt. I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues. Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, first let me commend my colleague from Arizona for his eloquent statement and my colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden. I certainly share the views they both expressed this evening. This is a tragedy I do not believe we will be able to measure for a long, long time. It will have an impact on the West for decades. I hope we can take up the Bosnia resolution as early as next Wednesday or Tuesday.

Mr. President, I do not know how many of my colleagues saw the picture on the front page of the New York Times this morning. It is an unusual and historic picture. When you first look at it, all you see is a group of refugees. If you look a little closer, you will see men in military uniform. Those men are part of what has been called the U.N. Protection Force. They are standing by observing men being taken out of Srebrenica who are suspected, by Bosnian Serb forces of ``war crimes,'' young women being taken out for purposes that I cannot describe, old women and children who are starving to death and being forced to walk unknown distances. Rather than describe it in my words, let me just read: In what has been a ritual of previous ``ethnic cleansing'' campaigns by the Bosnian Serbs to rid territories of Muslim populations, the Serbs who took Srebrenica separated the military-age men from the refugees and said they would be ``screened for war crimes,'' a United Nations spokesman here said. The air was filled with anguished cries as the Bosnian Serbs loaded the first 3,000 women, children and elderly . . . Mr. President, we have gone from a situation where the Europeans were supposed to be protecting people to now sitting by and watching atrocities and war crimes being perpetrated before their very eyes. And they stand by helpless. What could possibly be the effect throughout the world of scenes such as this? Mr. President, as Senator Dole said in his recent statement, it is over. It is over, Mr. President. ``It was quite a horrifying scene,'' said Steven Oberreit of Doctors Without Borders. ``There was screaming and crying and panic. They didn't know where they were being taken to.'' The refugees fled to Potocari on Tuesday night after Bosnian Serb troops swept into the town of Srebrenica, the heart of the United Nations safe area . . . Today, 1,500 Bosnian Serb troops, backed by tanks . . . overran the base with no resistance after they threatened to shell the refugees and kill the Dutch peacekeepers they were holding hostage if NATO warplanes intervened. Mr. President, we have crossed the line from danger to humiliation. We have crossed the line from attempts to do the right thing to degradation and dishonor. Mr. President, we cannot allow this to continue. And if events follow unchecked, next will be the enclave of Zepa, and then Gorazde, and next [[Page S 9880]] maybe even Sarajevo. Mr. President, it is time they got out, and it is time we helped them out, and it is time we help the Bosnian Muslims defend themselves. Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for an observation? Mr. McCAIN. Yes. Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am glad to hear the Senator on the floor speaking to this. Would the Senator acknowledge what everybody forgets? I know the Senator is angry about it, as well. I want to remind everybody that the reason why the U.N. observers are there is that the United Nations went in and disarmed--disarmed--not only did we fail to allow the Bosnian Government to get arms, the arms that existed, we went into Srebrenica--the United Nations did, with our support--and disarmed the Bosnian Government, disarmed the Muslims, disarmed the Croats, in return for a promise that we would protect them. And when, in fact, it was clear and the Dutch were called in for air strikes by NATO, Mr. Akashi said no. I want everybody to remember what the Senator from Arizona is saying here. Not only did we not protect, we affirmatively--the United Nations and the West--disarmed those safe areas, took their weapons and said, ``We promise you in return that we will keep the Serbs from the door.'' But they knocked on the door, knocked it down, and there was nothing there for them to defend themselves with. Now, as the Senator from Arizona said, they stand by and watch. And it is not the fault of those Dutch blue helmets. It is the fault of the contact group. It is the fault of the West for failing to intervene, at a minimum with air power, significant air power. But I think the Senator is absolutely correct. This is an atrocity. We should lift the embargo immediately and we should make available what, under the law, the President is allowed to do. Two years ago, this Senate and Congress passed a piece of legislation authorizing the President, in his discretion, to make available up to 50 million dollars worth of weapons off the shelf now for those people. I stood in Tuzla the last time this happened and watched trucks come into Tuzla loaded with women and children, and I thought they were celebrating when I first saw them because they were holding up children in these dump trucks above their heads. As they unloaded the dump trucks, I understood why the children were being held above their heads and held outside of the dump truck. Do you know why, Mr. President? Because when they opened the gate and got out, there were three children smothered to death in the bottom of those 1995 versions of cattle cars being dragged into Auschwitz. If these were not Moslems, the world would be reacting, just like if it were not Jews in the thirties, the world would react. Shame on the West. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be granted an additional 5 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the emotion of my friend from Delaware. I appreciate his compassion. I think the challenge before us now is to try to devise, working with the administration, a way to end this tragedy as quickly as possible for a minimum loss of human life, recognizing at this point that there are no good options. There are no good options in Bosnia today. What we need to do is choose the least bad option if we expect to stop this ongoing tragedy. The reason I pointed out this picture again--this is the first time, I think, in history we have ever seen a picture of people who are in uniform, designated as peacekeepers, standing by and watching people being ethnically cleansed, mass rape, and, of course, the arrest and probable torture of young men. That is what the U.N. Protection Force has been reduced to. That is why, in my view, this was ill-conceived and flawed from the beginning--because it was an attempt to keep peace where there was no peace. I wanted to give some facts as to how bad the situation is. Let me point out that I believe the United States should be prepared to assist in the effort to help remove the United Nations protection force and remove U.N. and allied forces from Bosnia. I want to just lay out the criteria. I hope at some time we can have a significant debate and discussion of this issue, possibly as early as next week. But I want to lay out the following criteria, because we have to be clear. The operation must be conducted under U.S. or NATO command. It must have a clear mission objective, precluding any danger of mission creep, and the operational rules of engagement must be established and approved by NATO. Under no circumstances should the United Nations be permitted to participate in any way in the planning or implementation of a withdrawal operation. To allow any U.N. influence would be to risk the same failed policies from which UNPROFOR so clearly suffers. To allow U.N. participation in command decisions would be to risk repeating the gutless refusal to destroy Serb air defenses, a U.N. decision which led to the shootdown of an American F-16 last month. Mr. President, the administration has committed 25,000 U.S. forces as part of an evacuation force. Once again, we must recognize that we must be willing to devote whatever forces in support that are necessary to successfully complete the mission--an overwhelming force to guarantee the safety of our men and women in uniform and those of our allies. Finally, Mr. President, clear warnings must be issued to all parties involved in the Bosnian conflict. Should one American be injured or killed while participating in a withdrawal operation, the United States will not hesitate to use its military might to punish such aggression. I would like to be specific. If the Bosnian Serbs harm Americans while this rescue operation is going on, I suggest the most punishing air strikes imaginable, and going as far away as Belgrade, if necessary. Mr. President, it is our obligation morally to rescue the U.N. Protection Forces. It is also our moral obligation to do everything necessary to protect the lives of our young men and women who are involved in that operation, and make the cost so extremely high that we can guarantee to a significant degree the safety of those men and women. Every day UNPROFOR stays, every hostage that is taken, every attack on the safe areas, every strategically ineffectual air strike and every sortie that has no mission but returns safely to base, creates the perception of a feeble Western alliance. Every day UNPROFOR is in place is another day that the Bosnian Government forces are precluded from protecting themselves against Serb aggression. Remove UNPROFOR, lift the arms embargo and allow the people of Bosnia to fight for their future. Unfortunately, harsh, cold, military facts will resolve this conflict. One side will prevail. I hope it is the lawful government of Bosnia. I find it very troubling that we have interfered with these realities to the benefit of the aggressor, by imposing an arms embargo on the victim. If we are unwilling to commit American forces to defend Bosnians, we cannot in good faith prevent the Bosnians from defending themselves. I want to thank Senator Dole for his proposal on this issue. I hope that next week we will take up this issue as soon as possible. Every hour that we delay, more innocent people will die. Every hour that we delay, will mean more humiliation and degradation of the United Nations and NATO. The repercussions of this kind of dishonor will reverberate around the world. We must bring it to a halt. I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues. Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, first let me commend my colleague from Arizona for his eloquent statement and my colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden. I certainly share the views they both expressed this evening. This is a tragedy I do not believe we will be able to measure for a long, long time. It will have an impact on the West for decades.

57,"BOSNIA AND THE BUDGET The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Ganske] is recognized for 60 minutes. Mr. GANSKE. Mr. Speaker, we are facing today debate on two big issues, the two B's, the two great B's, the budget and Bosnia. Since we have had some debate tonight on the budget, let me just spend a few minutes before I move on to the second B, Bosnia. There has been a lot of misperception about what exactly is in the budget that Congress has passed. But let me give you the facts. In 1995, we spend for Medicare $178 billion. This will go up every year for the next 7 years, so that by the year 2002 we will spend $290 billion for Medicare. This is an increase by anyone's calculations. In the last 7 years, we have spent $926 billion on Medicare. In the next 7 years, we will spend $1.6 trillion. This is at twice the rate of inflation. Just a couple of years ago, President Clinton, in speaking to the country about his health care plan at that time, said anything goes up at twice the rate of inflation is not a cut. {time} 1830 Let us look at some other areas. Medicaid, 1995, we have spent $90 billion. This will increase every year for the next 7 years so that by the year 2002 we will be spending $127 billion. In the last 7 years, for Medicaid, we have spent $444 billion, and we propose increasing that to $770 billion in the next 7 years. That is an increase of $330 billion. SHOULD WE SEND TROOPS TO BOSNIA? But let me get to the second issue, the issue of Bosnia. Let me begin with the basic issue. Should we or should we not put United States troops into Bosnia? Let us look at the various arguments President Clinton has laid before the public and why I believe they are flawed. I have given the President the benefit of the doubt. I have listened carefully to United States negotiators, Richard Holbrooke and General Clark, and have discussed this issue with several Congressmen who have just returned from Bosnia. I am indebted to Charles Krauthammer's testimony on Bosnia recently before the House Committee on National Security, and to Michael Glenon's article on foreign affairs a few years ago on the role of Congress and war. Despite Mr. Holbrooke's protestations, the deal calls for Bosnia and Herzegovina to be partitioned by a 2-mile wide demilitarized zone, a DMZ that NATO will patrol. There will be a Croat-Moslem coalition and a Serb republic with a weak central government for show. The NATO troops can kill anyone who stands in the way of separation or is presumed to constitute a threat. Approximately 60,000 troops, one-third English, one-third French, and one-third United States troops, will be on the ground. As many as 37,000 United States troops may ultimately be involved, and American reservists will be part of the operation, including some from my home State of Iowa. Up to one-third of current NATO forces may be committed to this venture. Let us examine the reasons that President Clinton, in his speech to the American people, gave for putting the lives of American troops into harm's way. First, in comparing the current situation in Sarajevo to World War I, President Clinton said, ``We must never go down the road of isolationism again.'' Now to argue that if we do not put troops on the ground into Bosnia will lead to United States isolationism ignores the facts. The United States is robustly internationalist today as compared to the Smooth-Hawley days of protectionism. Look at United States involvement in GATT, United States involvement in NAFTA, the $20 billion Mexico bailout or the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. Indeed, many would argue that the United States has been too internationalist in areas such as the 1993 Somalia fiasco or Lebanon in 1982. Was the United States not involved in Grenada in 1983, in Panama in 1989, and in the Persian Gulf in 1991? How can one talk about isolationism when we have troops in Haiti? Second, President Clinton invoked the moral imperative; sending United States troops to Bosnia is ``the right thing to do.'' It is true that for 3 years atrocities have been committed by both sides in a terrible civil war. Television has brought these horrors into our living rooms just as it brought the horrors of Vietnam into our homes 25 years ago. Our hearts go out to the victims, and compassion cries out for action. Yet, wise leadership calls for more than compassion in a world torn by strife in a dozen or more places around the Earth. What is the difference between Bosnia and Rwanda, Bosnia and Liberia or the Sudan, Bosnia and Peru, Bosnia and Sri Lanka? I was recently in Guatemala, where an insurrection has gone on for years. There are victims in all of these places that tug at our hearts. How do we decide where to put American troops at risk? I believe that the American people support the use of troops overseas for very specific purposes only, to honor our treaties, to protect the lives of Americans overseas, to defend our country, and to protect our national security and interests. This brings us to the third part of President Clinton's argument, ``Generations of Americans have understood that Europe's freedom and stability is vital to our own national security. That is why we fought two wars in Europe.'' Basically, President Clinton is resurrecting the domino theory for the Balkans. I ask, what evidence is there for the spread of this war? This civil war has been going on for 3 years, and there is no evidence for its spread. This is not 1914. The situation is totally different. There is no European interest in the Balkans other than the major powers staying out of a confrontation with each other. Fourth, the President says, ``As NATO's leader and the primary broker of the peace agreement, the United States must be an essential part of the [[Page H 14230]] mission.'' Inherent in the President's argument is the rationalization that the United States has an obligation to assist its NATO allies whose troops are already on the ground. I think this is dubious reasoning. In the first place, the United States has no NATO treaty commitments to policing a civil war in the Balkans. Second, Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staffs, concedes that from a purely military standpoint the West European nations could undertake the Bosnian mission on their own. Third, going forward with deployment could actually be worse to NATO than the damage of nondeployment. Krauthammer argues that deployment could result in one or two humiliations; first a humiliating retreat, as in the case of Somalia and Lebanon, in which our allies were left high and dry; or, second, we go in and then persist in a thankless, unwinnable, and costly operation that erodes the solidarity of the alliance. More than 200 U.N. troops have already been killed in Bosnia. U.S. generals warn that there will be casualties. When U.S. body bags start coming home and television interviews American amputees, where will the support be in the United States for NATO? The motives of the Bosnian accord are morally worthy. Who could not help but want to bring peace to those suffering war victims? Yet, as a political leader and as the Commander in Chief, the President has a responsibility not just to try to do good but also to have undertaken a mission that has a reasonable chance of success. By all reports, enforcing this agreement is going to be a tactical nightmare. I recently spoke to a United States Senator who served in Vietnam and is just back from a fact-finding mission in Bosnia. He described the mountainous, forested terrain as some of the most difficult to fight in that he is seen. The difficult terrain will negate a lot of the technological advantage that our forces have. Our equipment will be too heavy for most of the roads and bridges. Winter weather conditions will complicate air superiority, and there are an estimated 6 million unmarked land mines. This map of Bosnia illustrates several areas that are problematic. The red line represents the demilitarized zone. We have several areas here that are worrisome. We have an area, Gorazde, which is primarily Moslem. This is totally surrounded by Serb territory, and yet we have created a corridor in which there supposedly will be no Serbian arms. Another problem area will be the narrow corridor up by Brcko. Another area of great concern is the area surrounding Sarajevo controlled by the Serbs, none of whom are happy with this agreement. The hair-trigger task of separating the warring parties is supposed to take place in the first 30 days, before most of the main occupying force has arrived. Will the U.S. troops play local cop? I ask this question because during the occupation of Haiti a year ago American soldiers had to stand back and watch while thugs beat up local citizens. Will our troops in Bosnia be forced to watch atrocities just outside the DMZ line that they are guarding? If the participants want peace, why do we need to send an armored division? The answer, of course, is that as Assistant Secretary of State Holbrooke has admitted that arms had to be twisted to get the agreement signed by the Bosnians and the Serbs. Recent news reports document that the parties to this agreement are not very happy with the territorial provisions, and as Mr. Krauthammer has said so forcefully, if you are unhappy with the imposed peace, there is nothing like blowing up 241 Marines or killing 18 U.S. Rangers to make your point. Killing Americans is a faster way to victory than killing your traditional enemy. This brings us to the question: What role should Congress play in the Bosnia problem? Without getting into a long discussion of the constitutional law and the War Powers Act, it is clear that the Founding Fathers were fearful that the executive branch is most interested in war and most prone to it. This is why the Constitution invests the war powers with Congress. Jefferson, in a letter to Madison, wrote, ``We have already given an example of one effectual check to the dog of war by transferring the power of letting him loose from the executive to the legislative body, from those who are to spend to those who are to pay.'' One obvious advantage Congress brings to the decision whether to participate in these warlike endeavors is that Congress represents the diversity of opinion of the country. President Lincoln knew the value of diverse opinion and legislative deliberation. He said, ``In a certain sense and to a certain extent, the President is the representative of the people. He is elected by them, as well as Congress is. But can he, in the nature of things, know the wants of the people as well as 300 other men coming from all the various localities of the Nation? If so, where is the propriety of having a Congress?'' Mr. Speaker, the wiser course of action is not to put American troops on the ground. What we should do is lift the arms embargo. The Secretary of State has said recently that we will arm the Bosnians, if necessary, but we hope it is not necessary. Well, Mr. Speaker, it probably will be necessary, and we will then be viewed as taking sides. We already are not viewed as neutral by the Bosnian Serbs, but we also do not have troops at risk right now. In summary, Mr. Speaker, while our motives are good, I fear that putting American troops on the ground in the middle of a civil war, where ethnic hatreds run deep, where the technical details of the plan are suspect, where a time-limited cease-fire is likely to resume into full-fledged war once our troops are gone and where there is no clear- cut U.S. interest is just plain wrong. My constituents have told me, ``Stop don't do this. Do not send American troops on a mission they can't win, for reasons we don't understand.'' {time} 1845 Vietnam veteran James Smith recently wrote about his son, who was killed in Somalia: As my sacrifice was wasted in Vietnam and my son's sacrifice was wasted in Somalia, will there be more wasted sacrifices in Bosnia? This old soldier is not convinced. I cannot support sending troops to Bosnia. This Congressman has similar concerns. I beg the House leadership to give this Congress the right to vote on a resolution that would stop the deployment of U.S. troops now, and I beg the President to reconsider his decision. It is not too late. Throughout this debate we will hear many arguments for the need to support our troops. Let me be clear that I share this commitment that every Member of this body has toward the young men and women who will risk their lives to defend our freedoms. This weekend I will be in Bosnia with a congressional delegation, and as a physician who is in the Army reserve medical corps, I will be especially interested in the military medical preparations. If United States troops do end up in Bosnia, I want to know how to best support them. But let me also be clear, that on the basis of my current knowledge, I believe that we can support our troops best by not sending them to Bosnia. This mission is simply breathing space before the next round in fighting. Congress should do all it can to stop this action. At the end of the day, it is not that Americans cannot tolerate casualties. It is that Americans do not tolerate casualties for nothing. With that, I would yield to the gentlewoman from Idaho. Mrs. CHENOWETH. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I appreciate his good comments, and I look forward to joining the gentleman and some other of the Members in our trip to Bosnia to look at the situation firsthand this weekend. I think that it is so incredibly important to be able to see what our troops are going to be going through and to be able to visit with our troops in Frankfort, not only to encourage our troops, but also to be meeting with the heads of State of the warring factions. Mr. Speaker, I am of firm belief that the President in this case is not using the constitutional authority given to him and is abusing the power that was given to him by the Constitution. I have asked over and over and over again to have constitutional scholars show me where the President has the authority to commit military troops to the mission that he has in Bosnia. I cannot find anyone who can show me, outside of case law, and very vague [[Page H 14231]] case law, not on point to what the President has declared to be our mission in Bosnia, which is, interestingly enough, not to keep the peace, because there has not been peace there since before the Roman Empire, when the Romans were trying to maintain peace in that area. But we will be enforcing the peace by the President's own words. Now, you cannot enforce the peace without committing war to enforce peace. That is what war is. That is why we are arming our troops to go to Bosnia. I have been very pleased to listen to Mr. Dornan from California on many of his special order speeches as he compares the other commitments by the other NATO nations. I look forward to a colloquy with Mr. Dornan on the other commitments by the other NATO nations, as well as getting into what the President's authority really is, because this President, I maintain, does not have the authority. He is maintaining his leadership by assertion, not by law, and certainly not by constitutional law. Mr. GANSKE. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I would like to followup on the gentlewoman's comments. There is precedent over the past 200 years for the President occasionally doing military exercises, that is, Presidents have sent forces against the Barbary pirates. There have been missions sent out with the various expansions of our country. There are quite a few examples. But it seems to me that there does come a time, and there is a line that needs to be drawn in the definition of what is a police action and what is a very, very significant military action. When we are putting a division of forces on the ground in the middle of a civil war in the Balkans, when we are talking about 37,000 American troops involved, this is not a small operation. I believe it was clearly the intent of the Founding Fathers that in something of this magnitude, it was inherent in the Constitution, which gives Congress the right to declare war, the dominant position in terms of deciding whether we send American men and women overseas into harm's way. With that, I will be happy to yield to the distinguished gentleman from California [Mr. Dornan], a Vietnam veteran, somebody who has spoken eloquently on the role of the military, who may desire to also further enlighten us on the relationship between Congress and the Executive, who has been through some of the vigorous discussions related to the War Powers Act and other things, but who also I think can significantly add to this discussion in terms of some of the technical details and what exactly we are getting into. Mr. DORNAN. Dr. Ganske, I appreciate your yielding to me. I enjoyed getting to know you at a dinner in your district and seeing that beautiful great turn-of-the-century house that you live in, and knowing that as a healer of people, you, like all of us here on both sides of the aisle, of every ideological persuasion, are terrified of how quickly this could take a bad turn, not even any worse than the streets of Mogadishu, 19 young men dead, and another 90 carrying wounds, some more severe than others, the rest of their life. This is a wonderful opportunity, during the first massive change of leadership in the House in 40 years, since I was a 21-year-old pilot in the very first election of my life, this House has been controlled by one ideology and one party, and now we get a shift. We have the Nation's attention, watching the political process, with this majestic C-SPAN broadcast of this, the world's greatest deliberative body, with all due respect to that gorgeous building on the Thames, the mother of parliaments, and we have a chance to educate one another. Now, if there was someone who fell down in the entrance way, and their lips started to turn blue and they had a heart attack, there is not much I could do except scream for you or Dr. Weldon or Dr. Coburn and say, ``Come here, Greg, what do you do? I will hold people back.'' But let me tell you what you just said. I was only educated about 48 hours ago. My pal John McCain during the Haiti invasion invoked Thomas Jefferson as you just did, starting with our third President in 1801, his very first few months in office, that we can go in some instances, because, look, Jefferson did it. McCain did it again, our friend John McCain, served here honorably for years, a fine Senator, a western Senator, just south of Idaho down there in Arizona, he said again on Brinkley this weekend, ``Look what Jefferson did with the Barbary pirates.'' That is not only bad history; it is so wrong it is frightening. A scholar with a published book on Presidential war power that anybody can get from the Library of Congress, this one is printed by the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Lewis Fisher, brings me over his book, this scholar from our Congressional Research Service, and gives me a paper that was dated last year, a year and a half ago, in response to Haiti, and McCain and others saying well, Jefferson did this, and it turns out that our friend with his big medallion right up here, Thomas Jefferson, right above the speaker, honored as one of our 23 lawmakers, Jefferson said, ``I can't do anything that is offensive or attacking in nature. I can only respond to an attack on the United States and defend it.'' That is pretty vital interest, an attack. He said, ``I need help on the Barbary pirates.'' The House of Representatives not only passed resolutions; they turned it into public law, and one of them was the very day before Jefferson was inaugurated, in those days, right up through Rossevelt's second term, was March 4, on March 3, 1801, when Haiti, by the way, it was then called Santa Dominique, was exploding in bloodshed, a result of the French reign of terror, had now come to Haiti, where the slaves killed every single European heritage person on the whole island of Hispaniola. That includes what is today called Santa Domingo, the Dominican Republic. While that turmoil is going on, Thomas Jefferson gets a law passed the day before he is sworn in that says in effect, go get the Barbary pirates. Nine more public laws, pushing him as it pushed the single termer that he beat, John Adams, before. So we have got to get this scholarship, and that is why I asked Helen, who sat there with you as a freshman on this historic day. On the 53d anniversary of Pearl Harbor, today is the 54th, Newt Gingrich told you, Dr. Ganske of Iowa and Helen Chenoweth of Idaho, to read the Federalist Papers. It made me want to go back and read it. Steve Horn, who has joined us, near me in the Long Beach area of California, did not have to read it, he teaches it. He taught it as a professor for years. Wait until we look tonight briefly at the Federalist Papers again. Helen Chenoweth, would you please read Alexander Hamilton, another father of our country, and see what he says about the limit on our Chief Executive, because kings in England, and queens, declared war at will, how we wanted to take power away from our Chief Executive. Mrs. CHENOWETH. Thank you, Mr. Dornan. I was very pleased to be able to read the Federalist Papers, and I turn to them often, because in Federalist No. 69, Alexander Hamilton did say this: ``The President is to be the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States. In this respect, his authority would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great Britain, but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces as first the general and admiral of the confederacy, while that of the British king extends to declaring war and to raising and regulating fleets and armies, all which by the Constitution under consideration would appertain to the legislature,'' this body, Mr. Dornan. Further, Abraham Lincoln, in writing to his law partner in 1837, William Herndon, wrote this. It is very interesting. ``The provisions of the Constitution giving the war making power to Congress was dictated as I understand it by the following reasons: Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object. This our Convention understood to be the most oppressive of all kingly oppressions, and they resolved to frame the Constitution so that no one should hold [[Page H 14232]] the power of bringing that oppression upon us.'' Mr. DORNAN. Mr. Ganske, I find that that oppression is being brought upon us by a man who would deem to be king. Mr. GANSKE. If the gentlewoman would yield, I think this shows the essential wisdom of the Founding Fathers, because they understood that it is a lot easier to get involved in wars than it is to get out of wars. They did not want this power to be concentrated in the hands of one individual. Very specifically during the constitutional debates, they decided to vest that authority in the House of the people, in Congress, and over the years this has slipped, as has been mentioned. I think, however, there were some very important lessons that all of us learned about 25 years ago, and that was that in order to sustain an overseas military operation or effort, you have to have the American people behind you. They have to be committed. It is like I said before, the American people, if they know that they are fighting for a cause that is justified by U.S. interests or fulfilling treaty commitments, can sustain casualties. We have shown that many times in our Nation's history, with some of the highest casualties ever. The problem that we have with this current situation is that, quite frankly, the administration has not made the case to the American people that we have an overwhelming national interest in this area or that we have commitments, treaty, contractual commitments, that obligate us to this course of action, or that in the long run, after 6 months, 8 months, a year, when our forces are gone, that it will have made any difference 6 months or a year afterward. {time} 1900 Mr. DORNAN. Somalia. Mr. GANSKE. Somalia. Mr. DORNAN. And maybe Haiti next year. Mr. GANSKE. I think we are seeing a backing away from the current Haiti administration from a commitment that they had made before. Mr. DORNAN. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield for a colloquy. Mr. GANSKE. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. DORNAN. I am not a lawyer, but I want to ask Professor Horn something, and before a lawyer would say, ah, reductio ad absurdum, sometimes, if you step back and carry something to the absurd, it really clarifies a point. Suppose, hypothetically, using all the arguments we have heard out of the White House, and some very excellent support that they got over the last couple of days from some of my conservative friends who have thrown up their hands using this phony Vietnam line, you have to support the troops, We all support the troops. I am still wearing my old Ironsides first armored division patch here. Of course, we support the troops. God love them. But here is my example. Suppose tomorrow President Clinton said, I cannot stand the pictures of any more of these little beautiful black babies dying in Rwanda. We have to go in there with force to protect the distribution of food. And, by the way, Somalia haunts me. I should not have been so weak over 19 deaths. This is a volunteer army, they are paid to take chances. By the way, we hear that. So I am going back into Somalia. And while we are at it, I think I am going to reinforce Haiti. It is starting to get squirrely there. Aristide is starting to disappoint me, Bill Clinton, so I am sending the 10th Mountain Division back into Haiti. Now, what is the difference, except that he is doing it in five places instead of two? He wants to go back in and reinforce Haiti, send the troops to Bosnia by Christmas, and go to Somalia and Rwanda. And once one person from an Air Force aircraft was on the ground, a loadmaster putting in supplies for the first GI to arrive, we would hear the cry, support the troops. Is his power, Steve Horn, utterly unlimited, since there has not been a declared war since 1941 tomorrow, on the 8th? And the one before that was this very day in the Senate on April 7, 1917. Is that it? No more declared wars? Imperial presidency? Mr. HORN. Well, it is clear the President does not have that power, and only a rogue and a scoundrel would let a President have that power. And that is why Congress has to stand up, debate this one way or the other, and either by a majority vote give the President the authority in a special circumstance or deny the President the authority. As you suggest, Mr. Dornan, the bit of support our troops and waving it and saying that supports my policy in X, Y, or Z, is a true refuge for scoundrels and a misuse of the Presidency. And, of course, if it goes too far, and they just run over the Congress, as some Presidents have in the last generation, then I think somebody needs to get out the impeachment resolutions and say, thus, you will not go farther. It is very clear in the whole history of the United States that unless we are in a defensive mode, where we are attacked and must immediately respond, the President needs to consult the Congress. And as the gentleman suggested, the early precedents are quite clear. President Washington, who had commanded the revolutionary army, and knew, as the first President, that whatever he did was setting precedence for future Presidents, and Jefferson, as the gentleman will recall was his Secretary of State. Mr. DORNAN. That is right. Mr. HORN. And Adams, who was deeply involved in carrying on the federalist tradition after Washington, he, of course, was Vice President under Washington. So when Washington wanted to deal with an Indian tribe situation, which was the case in his time, he went to Congress and Congress gave that authority. That also happened with Adams. And as the gentleman says, when Jefferson got in, he convened his cabinet and listened to the arguments. Some of them wanted to give him more, quote, inherent power. Now, that game has been played by a lot of 20th century Presidents who say I have inherent power to do thus and so because I am either Chief Executive, or, more romantically, I am Commander in Chief. Utter nonsense. When President Truman tried to do that by seizing the steel mills in Youngstown Sheet and Tube versus Saywer, even his own friends on the court said, no, you cannot do that, Mr. President. As the gentleman will recall, they had a resolution flowing through here in no time to draft strikers into the military at that time. Cooler heads prevailed in the Senate. Interestingly enough the leader of that was Senator Taft of Ohio, who was very much disliked by labor at that time because he was the author of the Taft-Hartley Act. He said, wait a minute, you just cannot do that. That is improper conduct. Everybody cooled down, due to the Senate's cooling influences, and we went back to business as usual. It is simply wrong for Presidents to claim inherent power. That is king John at Runnymede, and that is why the barons reigned him in somewhat. Not necessarily for the people of England, but certainly for the barons of England. Mr. DORNAN. Mr. Horn, for the younger people listening, I digress for something rather wonderful. When I got here, in 1977, the British had lent us one of the three surviving copies of the Magna Carta from June 1215 at Runnymede. That is about the time the Serbs started fighting the Ottoman Serbs. Well, a few years later. And it sat in the center of the rotunda from our bicentennial, when I had just won a primary in California, all the way through that year, through our Republican caucuses. And then there were only 19 in my class, and 19 in Henry Hyde's class before, and we were suffering unfairly. The American people were punishing the Hill for Richard Nixon, and not a single Congressman or Senator had a scintilla of guilt on what came to be called Watergate. But it sat there through my whole first 6 years. And also, in the old House of Representatives, in Statuary Hall, was Thomas Jefferson's first original draft, where he had erased things so hard, like public property to turn into pursuit of happiness, that he wore out the page and glued in a little strip, like I used to do in grade school, and then rewrote on top of it. And when I would walk over to the Senate, I would pass Thomas Jefferson's original draft, in the center of the old House Chamber, and just run my hand across the top of the plastic case, and within seconds I am looking at the Magna Carta. [[Page H 14233]] When they took it home, they left the gold reproduction that is still in the Rotunda. We are still learning things here about the abuse of power and about the quotes that Mrs. Chenoweth was just reading to me over here, and we will get to them later, when my hour starts, about our forefathers. We throw that off so flippantly in school, the Founders, and then the Framers. And trying to be politically correct, I always try to throw in an Abigail Adams and the terrific wives that did not get the vote until 1920, but they were weighing in with their opinions, and they were all talking about King George III. Excellent Academy Award movie about him losing his marbles right in front of everybody's eyes. But this is not kingly power. And, remember, that when all these great thinkers in the beginning of that age of enlightenment, at least there was enlightenment over here and a reign of terror in Paris, they said their concept of a Commander in Chief was George Washington; a self-term-limiting man, two terms, a man who knew his limitations, and who was such a towering person of character, not with the intellectual ability to muse about things like Benjamin Franklin or Thomas Jefferson, but a tall character that presided over the Continental Congress in uniform. He was not puffed up about his uniform. He told people this lends me a little aura of dignity to settle some of these disputes here. That is who they were thinking of when they talked about Commander in Chief, not this person down there in the White House who thinks he is going to coast this entire year making our life miserable vetoing everything except defense bills. We got him locked on that because of Bosnia. Mr. HORN. He let that become law without his signature. Mr. DORNAN. That is right. He thinks he has an escape valve there somehow, so he can whine to other people about things in there that he did not want. By the way, and then I wan to turn to one of my other colleagues, people say how can he be so cavalier about where the money is coming for this? Not just the men on the ground, and I know I am annoying people I am saying it so much, but I want it in people's heads that I am not an isolationist. I am not echoing Pat Buchanan. I do want to help in Europe, and we are in there with air strikes. That is called air power. Sea power in the Adriatic, more than everybody else in the world combined. Airlift, sealift, fuel, food. I have walked in the hospitals in Zagreb. We are ready for massive casualties. Intelligence is dotting the ``I'' all right. It is 99, 98 percent ours. And we have 500 men and women as a blocking action in Macedonia wearing those Blue Berets. We are involved at great cost. Put yourself in Clinton's shoes. He did not want $7 billion in that defense appropriations. He started out saying this will cost a billion. A week ago it was 2. Today it is 4. He still thinks he has $3 billion to burn. There is $7 billion in defense appropriations for this 1 year that started October 1 that he does not want there. If he burned up $7 billion in this operation, he is back to where he wanted the defense appropriations bill anyway. Mr. GANSKE. Reclaiming my time, if the gentleman would allow me, I think the thing that will be on most of our constituents' minds in just a few weeks, unless Congress asserts the authority that it should, and that takes courage from the Congress to do this, as the gentleman from California was saying, but unless Congress at least has a full debate, up or down, should we be there, should we provide funding or not, then we will be. And I think what will be on our constituents' minds 2 or 3 weeks from now are the men and women in a cold, windy, mountainous, dangerous place at Christmas. And this is a long commitment that we are talking about. The French have recognized the reality of this situation. They have basically said we recognize this is not a short-term proposition. The disputed areas held by the Serbs all around Sarajevo is a situation where the Serbs do not want to leave. We, the French, understand that this could be a 10, 15, 20-year commitment. Remember the history in this area. A dictator with an iron hand ruled this country for 50 years. Peace was maintained. One might think that in a 50-year period of enforced peace that the various ethnic factions could begin to put aside their traditional centuries-old hatreds. And yet, as soon as that discipline was gone, we were back to a civil war. Mr. DORNAN. If the gentleman would yield for a second, can I show him something about these hatreds that is very upsetting? And I called to California to ask 1 of my 10 grandchildren to watch, because you do not have to meet one of my grandchildren, named Kevin Griffin, to know what he looks like. Here is his picture in both Time and in Newsweek, and taken by different photographers, I might add. Because these cameras will not zoom in this year, we will change that next year, I am going to pass these to Mrs. Chenoweth. This is my grandson in San Juan Capistrano, Kevin Griffin, and he is a refugee, a Moslem refugee from Srebrenica that fled to Tuzla, where we will be. They look at our American GIs that arrived there the other day to a welcome, the 1st Armored Division, and they want to just touch the Americans. Now, look at that blond haired, blue-eyed boy. And I am not giving any preferences, because I have Robert K. Dornan, III, here in Virginia, who is one-quarter Croatian with huge brown eyes. He is going to get a great tan and has dark hair. I have grandkids of all sizes and shapes, and 5 females and 5 males and a fifth female on the way, number 10, I think. I am asking my son not to tell me. But, of course, the hatreds are there and they are so intermarried for 600 years that if I look at somebody and I say, well, this guy has red hair, what, is he Irish? And they say, oh, he is a Moslem. No, sorry, he is Croatian. No, that is right, he is Serbian. And they are all killing one another based on traditions that are pathetic. I just got informed by our chief of everything here, Ron Lasch, that I had the misimpression that I have an hour coming up. {time} 1915 The gentleman took our second hour, and he has got about 15 minutes left, and then I can take a 5. The gentleman from California already had his 5, but Helen can take a 5, and that is about it. I do have something newsworthy and earthshaking. This morning I got a call from a friend in New York. They said the National Review magazine, dated Christmas Day, that goes in the mail because it is fortnightly, tomorrow has an article from an eyewitness at Dayton that will absolutely boggle your mind. It is called ``Yalta in the Balkans.'' He says there was a secret deal. This is starting to leak out now. I do not believe Mr. Warren Christopher, Secretary of State, knew. I think he was kept out of the loop by his number 2, Strobe Talbott, whose foreign policy has always been Soviets first, and now Russia first. He is fluent in Russian. Translated Khrushchev's memoirs when he was at Oxford with Clinton. He did the translating for this secret deal. The deal is: Poland go to hell; and Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, you will not be in an expanded NATO. Let me read some of this, because I think this is really hot, newsworthy stuff. I have taken it over to the Senators. My pal, Bob Dole, is in turmoil over there, because he is trying to drive the policy to make sure we arm the victims who have had all of those atrocities committed. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to put it in the Record. I will end the opening paragraphs, one gusty one at the close, then we will talk about it. Peter W. Rodman, a former national security adviser to both presidents Bush and to President Reagan. One of the better arguments for the Dayton Accords and the dispatching of U.S. troops to Bosnia was that putting the Bosnian conflict on ice would serve larger American strategic interests. One such interest was the future of the Western alliance. We are being browbeaten with this. The prolongation of the Bosnia war and the squabbles among allies were poisonous to the Alliance itself, and the resulting incoherence of policy was poisonous to NATO's credibility. A second key strategic was the enlargement of NATO into Central Europe and the prolongation of this Bosnian war was complicating this.'' During the climactic NATO bombing operations in September, starting in August, Boris Yeltsin gave a tempestuous news conference in which he conflated the two issues, [[Page H 14234]] blustering that an enlarged NATO would soon be dropping bombs on Russia's doorstep. The Dayton accords offer us a chance, in other words, to put all of this behind us and to refocus our European policy on larger concerns. The next three paragraphs are priceless, but in the interest of time, I will put them in the Record. It says this: As usual, the administration has its strategic priorities totally bass-backwards. This guy is writing tough street words. It is wrong to pay a price to Russia over Bosnia in the strategic coin of our larger interest in consolidating security in Central Europe. It is wrong to sacrifice NATO enlargement to the Russians over Bosnia or anything else. The administration's repeated assurances to Congress, and to the allies, that Russia would not have a veto over NATO enlargement turned out to be empty. Perhaps is just another of the ``terminological inexactitudes,'' that is the Clinton administration dialogue, that have become so familiar. A huge price will ultimately be paid for this. There is no current threat to Central Europe. The newly liberated states of the region, however, have just recently awakened from a 60-year nightmare. Still find themselves situated between Germany and Russia, and know in their bones that their survival is not guaranteed by history. They consider themselves part of the West culturally, politically, and morally and, therefore, seek Western assurances that we feel a stake in their security and independence. Seen in this light, NATO enlargement is not a new act, but a consolidation of the post-1989 status quo. They are free. This is Poland, Hungary, et al., sovereign countries exercising their free sovereign choice to associate with us. Either Russia accepts this, or does not. Three more great paragraphs in the Record. Call your Congressman and ask for it. Mr. Speaker, here is the punch line. By fear of antagonizing Russia, bad faith, whatever the short-term plot is for putting Bosnia on ice, in Central Europe we are seeing a strategic blunder of historic proportions. Mr. Speaker, this is the hidden deal at Dayton, OH. Mr. Speaker, I submit the following article for inclusion in the Record. [From the National Review, Dec. 25, 1995] Yalta in the Balkans (By Peter W. Rodman) Washington, DC.--One of the better arguments for the Dayton Accords and the dispatching of U.S. troops to Bosnia was that putting the Bosnia conflict on ice would serve larger American strategic interests. One such interest was the future of the Western alliance: the prolongation of the Bosnia war and the squabbles among the Allies were poisonous to the Alliance itself, and the resulting incoherence of Western policy was poisonous to NATO's credibility. A second key strategic interest was the enlargement of NATO into Central Europe, and prolongation of the Bosnia war was also complicating this (During the climatic NATO bombing operations in September, Boris Yeltsin gave a tempestuous news conference in which he conflated the two issues, blustering that an enlarged NATO would soon be dropping bombs on Russia's doorstep.) The Dayton Accords offer us a chance, in other words, to put all this behind us and to re-focus our European policy on our larger concerns. These arguments for Dayton still hold, but National Review has learned of a stunningly duplicitous turn in the Clinton Administration's policy toward Russia, Bosnia, and the Atlantic Alliance: The President and his associates are reported to have given Moscow secret assurances that, in return for its cooperation with the U.S. in Bosnia peacekeeping, NATO enlargement will be put ``on the back burner'' for the foreseeable future. The rationale was that, given this demonstration of Russia's readiness to be a partner in a new cooperative ``European security architecture,'' the extension of NATO security guarantees to Central Europe would not be a priority any time soon. This account comes from official and authoritative sources, both Russian and American. It has long been understood (indeed, admitted by some Administration officials) that concrete decisions on admitting new NATO members would be put off until after the Russian elections, especially the presidential election scheduled for June 1996--which meant, as a practical matter, until after the U.S. presidential election as well. Russian officials interpret the new assurances to mean that if Mr. Clinton is re-elected, nothing will happen on NATO enlargement in his second term either. The story is accompanied by reports of other assurances to the Russians that their cooperation on Bosnia would put the United States in their debt and earn them greater American understanding on other issues, such as their reassertion of control in their ``near abroad'' (Central Asia and the Caucasus, including the oil-rich Caspian basin). As usual, this Administration has its strategic priorities totally bass-ackwards. It is wrong to pay a price to Russia over Bosnia in the strategic coin of our larger interest in consolidating security in Central Europe. It is wrong to sacrifice NATO enlargement to the Russians over Bosnia or over anything else. The Administration's repeated assurances to Congress and to the Allies that Russia would not have a veto over NATO enlargement turn out to be empty--perhaps just another of the ``terminological inexactitudes'' that have become so familiar. A huge price will ultimately be paid for this. There is no current threat to Central Europe. The newly liberated states of the region, however, have just recently awakened from a 60-year nightmare, still find themselves situated between Germany and Russia, and know in their bones that their survival is not guaranteed by history. They consider themselves part of the West culturally, politically, and morally; they therefore seek Western assurances that we feel a stake in their security and independence. Seen in this light, NATO enlargement is not a new act, but a consolidation of the post-1989 status quo: they are free, sovereign countries exercising their free, sovereign choice to associate with us. Either Russia accepts this, or it does not. Leaving the security status of Central Europe ambiguous only leaves open temptations to Russian irredentists. NATO membership for Central Europe is among other things a way of telling the Russians that their acceptance of the post-1989 status quo in Central Europe is the sine qua non of any relationship with us. If the Russians have a problem with this--which they clearly seem to have--then we are all facing a major problem five or ten years down the road as Russia regains its strength. The Administration's rationale for delaying NATO enlargement has been twofold. One is the claim that it will be easier to achieve such enlargement if we go about it gradually. But the nationalist turn in Russian politics, expected to be given new impetus by the December elections for the Duma, tells us that it will not get any easier. Russia is only getting stronger and more assertive; every month, the risks and inhibitions on our side will only grow. The Administration's second rationale (at least, so I suspect) is what philosophy majors will remember as Zeno's Paradox: the idea that if you divide a distance into an infinite number of tiny increments, you never get to the destination. This may be the Administration's real calculation. In other words, it just doesn't want to enlarge NATO--for fear of antagonizing Moscow. The first rationale is bad judgment; the second is bad faith. Whatever the short-term plaudits due to the Administration for putting the Bosnia conflict on ice, in Central Europe we are seeing a strategic blunder of historic proportions. Mr. GANSKE. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time for a moment, I think the gentleman has pointed out, as I did in my initial statement, that possibly the worst thing that could happen from our getting more involved is that we now have increased the proximity to some significant interactions with the Russians. The United States troops will be positions in this area right here, very close to the Russian troops that will be in this area. Mrs. Chenoweth and I will be looking at this area this weekend. But, remember, General Clark informed us in a briefing that approximately one-third of NATO forces will be tied up in this endeavor. Now, there is a great deal of unrest in Russia. What happens if later this year there is a significant turnover in power and then we have a problem not in the Balkans, but in the Baltics, and we have this type of commitment? I mean, it is a matter of weighing some real significant options. Mr. Speaker, with that, I would yield to the gentlewoman from Idaho [Mrs. Chenoweth]. Mrs. CHENOWETH. Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting as we stop and think about the tests that we have been talking about, that the President, as Commander in Chief, simply has not passed. And one of those major tests is what I call the mother's test. I guess my major claim to fame is the fact that I am a mother. I am a mother of a military man who would respond to the command of his Commander in Chief, because that is the way he has been raised. But my heart breaks to think of mothers across this Nation having to let their sons and daughters go because of a President who does not understand what his role is and the role of the military, his responsibility as Commander in Chief; because, since the beginning of civilization, mothers have been willing to send their sons off to war to protect the interests of the country or the tribe or the community, to preserve the peace and tranquility of their existence, to make sure that freedom and liberty will reign for their future generation. That silent mother's test. But he has failed the mother's test. He has even failed the test of his own Secretary of State, who back in 1992 stated that we will commit troops only upon the following four criteria: No 1, [[Page H 14235]] is he said if the mission is clearly defined; No. 2, would be if the people in this country are behind the mission; No. 3, is if there was a very clear and reasonable chance for success; and No. 4 is if there is a good, strong exit strategy. All four of those the President fails on. And probably, Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentleman, the biggest failure is what will this do to the spirit of the military? The spirit of the military has been captured by a speech given by General MacArthur. I would like to quote just a paragraph from a great general who really understood warfare, understood how necessary it was for the general to take responsibility for his troops in the field. On May 12, 1962, in his speech, ``Duty, Honor, and Country,'' General MacArthur said, ``And through all of this,'' he said this to the graduates at West Point, he said: And through all of this welter of change and development that you will face, your mission remains fixed, determined, and it is to win our wars. Everything else in your professional career is but a corollary to this vital dedication. All other public purposes, all other public projects, all other public needs, great or small, will find others for their accomplishment, but profession of arms, the will to win, the sure knowledge that in war there is no substitute for victory, and that if you lose, the Nation will be destroyed. What are we setting our troops up for? Are we disspiriting our troops? Are we putting ourselves on a slippery slope, like we did in Vietnam, where we never have recovered economically, like the post- Vietnam wars? And the spirit of America took a hit that we were not even able to begin to recover until we had a President like Ronald Reagan who could really again show us how we could go in and win with the likes of Colin Powell and Dick Cheney. Mr. GANSKE. I thank the gentlewoman, and I am sure your phone calls have been the same as mine: overwhelmingly against this. The public does not understand the reason that we should be there, and my phone calls are 8 or 9 to 1 against this. Time and time again, people are phoning saying, do not do this. We do not understand. We think you will not accomplish anything of significance. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. HORN. Well, Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentleman, we have exactly the same experience, and I know a lot of our Democratic friends had that experience. The other day one representative, when asked how many letters do you get on this subject and what are they saying, she said all of them are against, 100 percent; not even one or two out of 100 supporting it. And I think the wisdom of the people in this case is right on the mark. People are not stupid. They know where our national interests ought to lie. No one has convinced us that American lives are at stake, even though Bosnia is one of the most tragic situations in the world. So was Cambodia, so were a number of places, so are those places right now in Asia and the Mideast and Africa. But we cannot be, as I said earlier today, super cop to the world, and that is sort of what we are getting ourselves into. Mr. GANSKE. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield for a minute, there is an option. The option is something that Senator Dole, for instance, recommended a couple of years ago, and that was make for a level playing field. Lift the arms embargo. Allow the various factions to have a level playing field and to settle their own civil war with the same type of support that we have done in the past, logistical and air, and yet not interpose ourselves into the middle of essentially a civil war. Mr. HORN. Mr. Speaker, one of our most successful operations, as the gentleman knows, happened under the Carter administration. It is ironic that many of the advisers of President Carter also are advising this administration. But what they did that was successful, they began the effort to provide arms to the Afghan Mujaheddin, and through Pakistan they did just that as really a covert operation without using American troops, and they were able to have sufficient arms go in that the world's second strongest superpower was driven out of Afghanistan where it never should have been in the first place. Mr. GANSKE. Mr. Speaker, let me summarize, and I thank my colleagues for joining me in this colloquy. I believe that this mission is primarily going to involve a breathing space for the warring parties. They need to rearm. They will do that on a brief enforced peace. I think at the end of the day it is not that America cannot tolerate casualties; it is that Americans just do not tolerate casualties unless they can see a real purpose.

Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Ganske] is recognized for 60 minutes. Mr. GANSKE. Mr. Speaker, we are facing today debate on two big issues, the two B's, the two great B's, the budget and Bosnia. Since we have had some debate tonight on the budget, let me just spend a few minutes before I move on to the second B, Bosnia. There has been a lot of misperception about what exactly is in the budget that Congress has passed. But let me give you the facts. In 1995, we spend for Medicare $178 billion. This will go up every year for the next 7 years, so that by the year 2002 we will spend $290 billion for Medicare. This is an increase by anyone's calculations. In the last 7 years, we have spent $926 billion on Medicare. In the next 7 years, we will spend $1.6 trillion. This is at twice the rate of inflation. Just a couple of years ago, President Clinton, in speaking to the country about his health care plan at that time, said anything goes up at twice the rate of inflation is not a cut. {time} 1830 Let us look at some other areas. Medicaid, 1995, we have spent $90 billion. This will increase every year for the next 7 years so that by the year 2002 we will be spending $127 billion. In the last 7 years, for Medicaid, we have spent $444 billion, and we propose increasing that to $770 billion in the next 7 years. That is an increase of $330 billion. SHOULD WE SEND TROOPS TO BOSNIA? But let me get to the second issue, the issue of Bosnia. Let me begin with the basic issue. Should we or should we not put United States troops into Bosnia? Let us look at the various arguments President Clinton has laid before the public and why I believe they are flawed. I have given the President the benefit of the doubt. I have listened carefully to United States negotiators, Richard Holbrooke and General Clark, and have discussed this issue with several Congressmen who have just returned from Bosnia. I am indebted to Charles Krauthammer's testimony on Bosnia recently before the House Committee on National Security, and to Michael Glenon's article on foreign affairs a few years ago on the role of Congress and war. Despite Mr. Holbrooke's protestations, the deal calls for Bosnia and Herzegovina to be partitioned by a 2-mile wide demilitarized zone, a DMZ that NATO will patrol. There will be a Croat-Moslem coalition and a Serb republic with a weak central government for show. The NATO troops can kill anyone who stands in the way of separation or is presumed to constitute a threat. Approximately 60,000 troops, one-third English, one-third French, and one-third United States troops, will be on the ground. As many as 37,000 United States troops may ultimately be involved, and American reservists will be part of the operation, including some from my home State of Iowa. Up to one-third of current NATO forces may be committed to this venture. Let us examine the reasons that President Clinton, in his speech to the American people, gave for putting the lives of American troops into harm's way. First, in comparing the current situation in Sarajevo to World War I, President Clinton said, ``We must never go down the road of isolationism again.'' Now to argue that if we do not put troops on the ground into Bosnia will lead to United States isolationism ignores the facts. The United States is robustly internationalist today as compared to the Smooth-Hawley days of protectionism. Look at United States involvement in GATT, United States involvement in NAFTA, the $20 billion Mexico bailout or the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. Indeed, many would argue that the United States has been too internationalist in areas such as the 1993 Somalia fiasco or Lebanon in 1982. Was the United States not involved in Grenada in 1983, in Panama in 1989, and in the Persian Gulf in 1991? How can one talk about isolationism when we have troops in Haiti? Second, President Clinton invoked the moral imperative; sending United States troops to Bosnia is ``the right thing to do.'' It is true that for 3 years atrocities have been committed by both sides in a terrible civil war. Television has brought these horrors into our living rooms just as it brought the horrors of Vietnam into our homes 25 years ago. Our hearts go out to the victims, and compassion cries out for action. Yet, wise leadership calls for more than compassion in a world torn by strife in a dozen or more places around the Earth. What is the difference between Bosnia and Rwanda, Bosnia and Liberia or the Sudan, Bosnia and Peru, Bosnia and Sri Lanka? I was recently in Guatemala, where an insurrection has gone on for years. There are victims in all of these places that tug at our hearts. How do we decide where to put American troops at risk? I believe that the American people support the use of troops overseas for very specific purposes only, to honor our treaties, to protect the lives of Americans overseas, to defend our country, and to protect our national security and interests. This brings us to the third part of President Clinton's argument, ``Generations of Americans have understood that Europe's freedom and stability is vital to our own national security. That is why we fought two wars in Europe.'' Basically, President Clinton is resurrecting the domino theory for the Balkans. I ask, what evidence is there for the spread of this war? This civil war has been going on for 3 years, and there is no evidence for its spread. This is not 1914. The situation is totally different. There is no European interest in the Balkans other than the major powers staying out of a confrontation with each other. Fourth, the President says, ``As NATO's leader and the primary broker of the peace agreement, the United States must be an essential part of the [[Page H 14230]] mission.'' Inherent in the President's argument is the rationalization that the United States has an obligation to assist its NATO allies whose troops are already on the ground. I think this is dubious reasoning. In the first place, the United States has no NATO treaty commitments to policing a civil war in the Balkans. Second, Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staffs, concedes that from a purely military standpoint the West European nations could undertake the Bosnian mission on their own. Third, going forward with deployment could actually be worse to NATO than the damage of nondeployment. Krauthammer argues that deployment could result in one or two humiliations; first a humiliating retreat, as in the case of Somalia and Lebanon, in which our allies were left high and dry; or, second, we go in and then persist in a thankless, unwinnable, and costly operation that erodes the solidarity of the alliance. More than 200 U.N. troops have already been killed in Bosnia. U.S. generals warn that there will be casualties. When U.S. body bags start coming home and television interviews American amputees, where will the support be in the United States for NATO? The motives of the Bosnian accord are morally worthy. Who could not help but want to bring peace to those suffering war victims? Yet, as a political leader and as the Commander in Chief, the President has a responsibility not just to try to do good but also to have undertaken a mission that has a reasonable chance of success. By all reports, enforcing this agreement is going to be a tactical nightmare. I recently spoke to a United States Senator who served in Vietnam and is just back from a fact-finding mission in Bosnia. He described the mountainous, forested terrain as some of the most difficult to fight in that he is seen. The difficult terrain will negate a lot of the technological advantage that our forces have. Our equipment will be too heavy for most of the roads and bridges. Winter weather conditions will complicate air superiority, and there are an estimated 6 million unmarked land mines. This map of Bosnia illustrates several areas that are problematic. The red line represents the demilitarized zone. We have several areas here that are worrisome. We have an area, Gorazde, which is primarily Moslem. This is totally surrounded by Serb territory, and yet we have created a corridor in which there supposedly will be no Serbian arms. Another problem area will be the narrow corridor up by Brcko. Another area of great concern is the area surrounding Sarajevo controlled by the Serbs, none of whom are happy with this agreement. The hair-trigger task of separating the warring parties is supposed to take place in the first 30 days, before most of the main occupying force has arrived. Will the U.S. troops play local cop? I ask this question because during the occupation of Haiti a year ago American soldiers had to stand back and watch while thugs beat up local citizens. Will our troops in Bosnia be forced to watch atrocities just outside the DMZ line that they are guarding? If the participants want peace, why do we need to send an armored division? The answer, of course, is that as Assistant Secretary of State Holbrooke has admitted that arms had to be twisted to get the agreement signed by the Bosnians and the Serbs. Recent news reports document that the parties to this agreement are not very happy with the territorial provisions, and as Mr. Krauthammer has said so forcefully, if you are unhappy with the imposed peace, there is nothing like blowing up 241 Marines or killing 18 U.S. Rangers to make your point. Killing Americans is a faster way to victory than killing your traditional enemy. This brings us to the question: What role should Congress play in the Bosnia problem? Without getting into a long discussion of the constitutional law and the War Powers Act, it is clear that the Founding Fathers were fearful that the executive branch is most interested in war and most prone to it. This is why the Constitution invests the war powers with Congress. Jefferson, in a letter to Madison, wrote, ``We have already given an example of one effectual check to the dog of war by transferring the power of letting him loose from the executive to the legislative body, from those who are to spend to those who are to pay.'' One obvious advantage Congress brings to the decision whether to participate in these warlike endeavors is that Congress represents the diversity of opinion of the country. President Lincoln knew the value of diverse opinion and legislative deliberation. He said, ``In a certain sense and to a certain extent, the President is the representative of the people. He is elected by them, as well as Congress is. But can he, in the nature of things, know the wants of the people as well as 300 other men coming from all the various localities of the Nation? If so, where is the propriety of having a Congress?'' Mr. Speaker, the wiser course of action is not to put American troops on the ground. What we should do is lift the arms embargo. The Secretary of State has said recently that we will arm the Bosnians, if necessary, but we hope it is not necessary. Well, Mr. Speaker, it probably will be necessary, and we will then be viewed as taking sides. We already are not viewed as neutral by the Bosnian Serbs, but we also do not have troops at risk right now. In summary, Mr. Speaker, while our motives are good, I fear that putting American troops on the ground in the middle of a civil war, where ethnic hatreds run deep, where the technical details of the plan are suspect, where a time-limited cease-fire is likely to resume into full-fledged war once our troops are gone and where there is no clear- cut U.S. interest is just plain wrong. My constituents have told me, ``Stop don't do this. Do not send American troops on a mission they can't win, for reasons we don't understand.'' {time} 1845 Vietnam veteran James Smith recently wrote about his son, who was killed in Somalia: As my sacrifice was wasted in Vietnam and my son's sacrifice was wasted in Somalia, will there be more wasted sacrifices in Bosnia? This old soldier is not convinced. I cannot support sending troops to Bosnia. This Congressman has similar concerns. I beg the House leadership to give this Congress the right to vote on a resolution that would stop the deployment of U.S. troops now, and I beg the President to reconsider his decision. It is not too late. Throughout this debate we will hear many arguments for the need to support our troops. Let me be clear that I share this commitment that every Member of this body has toward the young men and women who will risk their lives to defend our freedoms. This weekend I will be in Bosnia with a congressional delegation, and as a physician who is in the Army reserve medical corps, I will be especially interested in the military medical preparations. If United States troops do end up in Bosnia, I want to know how to best support them. But let me also be clear, that on the basis of my current knowledge, I believe that we can support our troops best by not sending them to Bosnia. This mission is simply breathing space before the next round in fighting. Congress should do all it can to stop this action. At the end of the day, it is not that Americans cannot tolerate casualties. It is that Americans do not tolerate casualties for nothing. With that, I would yield to the gentlewoman from Idaho. Mrs. CHENOWETH. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I appreciate his good comments, and I look forward to joining the gentleman and some other of the Members in our trip to Bosnia to look at the situation firsthand this weekend. I think that it is so incredibly important to be able to see what our troops are going to be going through and to be able to visit with our troops in Frankfort, not only to encourage our troops, but also to be meeting with the heads of State of the warring factions. Mr. Speaker, I am of firm belief that the President in this case is not using the constitutional authority given to him and is abusing the power that was given to him by the Constitution. I have asked over and over and over again to have constitutional scholars show me where the President has the authority to commit military troops to the mission that he has in Bosnia. I cannot find anyone who can show me, outside of case law, and very vague [[Page H 14231]] case law, not on point to what the President has declared to be our mission in Bosnia, which is, interestingly enough, not to keep the peace, because there has not been peace there since before the Roman Empire, when the Romans were trying to maintain peace in that area. But we will be enforcing the peace by the President's own words. Now, you cannot enforce the peace without committing war to enforce peace. That is what war is. That is why we are arming our troops to go to Bosnia. I have been very pleased to listen to Mr. Dornan from California on many of his special order speeches as he compares the other commitments by the other NATO nations. I look forward to a colloquy with Mr. Dornan on the other commitments by the other NATO nations, as well as getting into what the President's authority really is, because this President, I maintain, does not have the authority. He is maintaining his leadership by assertion, not by law, and certainly not by constitutional law. Mr. GANSKE. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I would like to followup on the gentlewoman's comments. There is precedent over the past 200 years for the President occasionally doing military exercises, that is, Presidents have sent forces against the Barbary pirates. There have been missions sent out with the various expansions of our country. There are quite a few examples. But it seems to me that there does come a time, and there is a line that needs to be drawn in the definition of what is a police action and what is a very, very significant military action. When we are putting a division of forces on the ground in the middle of a civil war in the Balkans, when we are talking about 37,000 American troops involved, this is not a small operation. I believe it was clearly the intent of the Founding Fathers that in something of this magnitude, it was inherent in the Constitution, which gives Congress the right to declare war, the dominant position in terms of deciding whether we send American men and women overseas into harm's way. With that, I will be happy to yield to the distinguished gentleman from California [Mr. Dornan], a Vietnam veteran, somebody who has spoken eloquently on the role of the military, who may desire to also further enlighten us on the relationship between Congress and the Executive, who has been through some of the vigorous discussions related to the War Powers Act and other things, but who also I think can significantly add to this discussion in terms of some of the technical details and what exactly we are getting into. Mr. DORNAN. Dr. Ganske, I appreciate your yielding to me. I enjoyed getting to know you at a dinner in your district and seeing that beautiful great turn-of-the-century house that you live in, and knowing that as a healer of people, you, like all of us here on both sides of the aisle, of every ideological persuasion, are terrified of how quickly this could take a bad turn, not even any worse than the streets of Mogadishu, 19 young men dead, and another 90 carrying wounds, some more severe than others, the rest of their life. This is a wonderful opportunity, during the first massive change of leadership in the House in 40 years, since I was a 21-year-old pilot in the very first election of my life, this House has been controlled by one ideology and one party, and now we get a shift. We have the Nation's attention, watching the political process, with this majestic C-SPAN broadcast of this, the world's greatest deliberative body, with all due respect to that gorgeous building on the Thames, the mother of parliaments, and we have a chance to educate one another. Now, if there was someone who fell down in the entrance way, and their lips started to turn blue and they had a heart attack, there is not much I could do except scream for you or Dr. Weldon or Dr. Coburn and say, ``Come here, Greg, what do you do? I will hold people back.'' But let me tell you what you just said. I was only educated about 48 hours ago. My pal John McCain during the Haiti invasion invoked Thomas Jefferson as you just did, starting with our third President in 1801, his very first few months in office, that we can go in some instances, because, look, Jefferson did it. McCain did it again, our friend John McCain, served here honorably for years, a fine Senator, a western Senator, just south of Idaho down there in Arizona, he said again on Brinkley this weekend, ``Look what Jefferson did with the Barbary pirates.'' That is not only bad history; it is so wrong it is frightening. A scholar with a published book on Presidential war power that anybody can get from the Library of Congress, this one is printed by the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Lewis Fisher, brings me over his book, this scholar from our Congressional Research Service, and gives me a paper that was dated last year, a year and a half ago, in response to Haiti, and McCain and others saying well, Jefferson did this, and it turns out that our friend with his big medallion right up here, Thomas Jefferson, right above the speaker, honored as one of our 23 lawmakers, Jefferson said, ``I can't do anything that is offensive or attacking in nature. I can only respond to an attack on the United States and defend it.'' That is pretty vital interest, an attack. He said, ``I need help on the Barbary pirates.'' The House of Representatives not only passed resolutions; they turned it into public law, and one of them was the very day before Jefferson was inaugurated, in those days, right up through Rossevelt's second term, was March 4, on March 3, 1801, when Haiti, by the way, it was then called Santa Dominique, was exploding in bloodshed, a result of the French reign of terror, had now come to Haiti, where the slaves killed every single European heritage person on the whole island of Hispaniola. That includes what is today called Santa Domingo, the Dominican Republic. While that turmoil is going on, Thomas Jefferson gets a law passed the day before he is sworn in that says in effect, go get the Barbary pirates. Nine more public laws, pushing him as it pushed the single termer that he beat, John Adams, before. So we have got to get this scholarship, and that is why I asked Helen, who sat there with you as a freshman on this historic day. On the 53d anniversary of Pearl Harbor, today is the 54th, Newt Gingrich told you, Dr. Ganske of Iowa and Helen Chenoweth of Idaho, to read the Federalist Papers. It made me want to go back and read it. Steve Horn, who has joined us, near me in the Long Beach area of California, did not have to read it, he teaches it. He taught it as a professor for years. Wait until we look tonight briefly at the Federalist Papers again. Helen Chenoweth, would you please read Alexander Hamilton, another father of our country, and see what he says about the limit on our Chief Executive, because kings in England, and queens, declared war at will, how we wanted to take power away from our Chief Executive. Mrs. CHENOWETH. Thank you, Mr. Dornan. I was very pleased to be able to read the Federalist Papers, and I turn to them often, because in Federalist No. 69, Alexander Hamilton did say this: ``The President is to be the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States. In this respect, his authority would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great Britain, but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces as first the general and admiral of the confederacy, while that of the British king extends to declaring war and to raising and regulating fleets and armies, all which by the Constitution under consideration would appertain to the legislature,'' this body, Mr. Dornan. Further, Abraham Lincoln, in writing to his law partner in 1837, William Herndon, wrote this. It is very interesting. ``The provisions of the Constitution giving the war making power to Congress was dictated as I understand it by the following reasons: Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object. This our Convention understood to be the most oppressive of all kingly oppressions, and they resolved to frame the Constitution so that no one should hold [[Page H 14232]] the power of bringing that oppression upon us.'' Mr. DORNAN. Mr. Ganske, I find that that oppression is being brought upon us by a man who would deem to be king. Mr. GANSKE. If the gentlewoman would yield, I think this shows the essential wisdom of the Founding Fathers, because they understood that it is a lot easier to get involved in wars than it is to get out of wars. They did not want this power to be concentrated in the hands of one individual. Very specifically during the constitutional debates, they decided to vest that authority in the House of the people, in Congress, and over the years this has slipped, as has been mentioned. I think, however, there were some very important lessons that all of us learned about 25 years ago, and that was that in order to sustain an overseas military operation or effort, you have to have the American people behind you. They have to be committed. It is like I said before, the American people, if they know that they are fighting for a cause that is justified by U.S. interests or fulfilling treaty commitments, can sustain casualties. We have shown that many times in our Nation's history, with some of the highest casualties ever. The problem that we have with this current situation is that, quite frankly, the administration has not made the case to the American people that we have an overwhelming national interest in this area or that we have commitments, treaty, contractual commitments, that obligate us to this course of action, or that in the long run, after 6 months, 8 months, a year, when our forces are gone, that it will have made any difference 6 months or a year afterward. {time} 1900 Mr. DORNAN. Somalia. Mr. GANSKE. Somalia. Mr. DORNAN. And maybe Haiti next year. Mr. GANSKE. I think we are seeing a backing away from the current Haiti administration from a commitment that they had made before. Mr. DORNAN. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield for a colloquy. Mr. GANSKE. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. DORNAN. I am not a lawyer, but I want to ask Professor Horn something, and before a lawyer would say, ah, reductio ad absurdum, sometimes, if you step back and carry something to the absurd, it really clarifies a point. Suppose, hypothetically, using all the arguments we have heard out of the White House, and some very excellent support that they got over the last couple of days from some of my conservative friends who have thrown up their hands using this phony Vietnam line, you have to support the troops, We all support the troops. I am still wearing my old Ironsides first armored division patch here. Of course, we support the troops. God love them. But here is my example. Suppose tomorrow President Clinton said, I cannot stand the pictures of any more of these little beautiful black babies dying in Rwanda. We have to go in there with force to protect the distribution of food. And, by the way, Somalia haunts me. I should not have been so weak over 19 deaths. This is a volunteer army, they are paid to take chances. By the way, we hear that. So I am going back into Somalia. And while we are at it, I think I am going to reinforce Haiti. It is starting to get squirrely there. Aristide is starting to disappoint me, Bill Clinton, so I am sending the 10th Mountain Division back into Haiti. Now, what is the difference, except that he is doing it in five places instead of two? He wants to go back in and reinforce Haiti, send the troops to Bosnia by Christmas, and go to Somalia and Rwanda. And once one person from an Air Force aircraft was on the ground, a loadmaster putting in supplies for the first GI to arrive, we would hear the cry, support the troops. Is his power, Steve Horn, utterly unlimited, since there has not been a declared war since 1941 tomorrow, on the 8th? And the one before that was this very day in the Senate on April 7, 1917. Is that it? No more declared wars? Imperial presidency? Mr. HORN. Well, it is clear the President does not have that power, and only a rogue and a scoundrel would let a President have that power. And that is why Congress has to stand up, debate this one way or the other, and either by a majority vote give the President the authority in a special circumstance or deny the President the authority. As you suggest, Mr. Dornan, the bit of support our troops and waving it and saying that supports my policy in X, Y, or Z, is a true refuge for scoundrels and a misuse of the Presidency. And, of course, if it goes too far, and they just run over the Congress, as some Presidents have in the last generation, then I think somebody needs to get out the impeachment resolutions and say, thus, you will not go farther. It is very clear in the whole history of the United States that unless we are in a defensive mode, where we are attacked and must immediately respond, the President needs to consult the Congress. And as the gentleman suggested, the early precedents are quite clear. President Washington, who had commanded the revolutionary army, and knew, as the first President, that whatever he did was setting precedence for future Presidents, and Jefferson, as the gentleman will recall was his Secretary of State. Mr. DORNAN. That is right. Mr. HORN. And Adams, who was deeply involved in carrying on the federalist tradition after Washington, he, of course, was Vice President under Washington. So when Washington wanted to deal with an Indian tribe situation, which was the case in his time, he went to Congress and Congress gave that authority. That also happened with Adams. And as the gentleman says, when Jefferson got in, he convened his cabinet and listened to the arguments. Some of them wanted to give him more, quote, inherent power. Now, that game has been played by a lot of 20th century Presidents who say I have inherent power to do thus and so because I am either Chief Executive, or, more romantically, I am Commander in Chief. Utter nonsense. When President Truman tried to do that by seizing the steel mills in Youngstown Sheet and Tube versus Saywer, even his own friends on the court said, no, you cannot do that, Mr. President. As the gentleman will recall, they had a resolution flowing through here in no time to draft strikers into the military at that time. Cooler heads prevailed in the Senate. Interestingly enough the leader of that was Senator Taft of Ohio, who was very much disliked by labor at that time because he was the author of the Taft-Hartley Act. He said, wait a minute, you just cannot do that. That is improper conduct. Everybody cooled down, due to the Senate's cooling influences, and we went back to business as usual. It is simply wrong for Presidents to claim inherent power. That is king John at Runnymede, and that is why the barons reigned him in somewhat. Not necessarily for the people of England, but certainly for the barons of England. Mr. DORNAN. Mr. Horn, for the younger people listening, I digress for something rather wonderful. When I got here, in 1977, the British had lent us one of the three surviving copies of the Magna Carta from June 1215 at Runnymede. That is about the time the Serbs started fighting the Ottoman Serbs. Well, a few years later. And it sat in the center of the rotunda from our bicentennial, when I had just won a primary in California, all the way through that year, through our Republican caucuses. And then there were only 19 in my class, and 19 in Henry Hyde's class before, and we were suffering unfairly. The American people were punishing the Hill for Richard Nixon, and not a single Congressman or Senator had a scintilla of guilt on what came to be called Watergate. But it sat there through my whole first 6 years. And also, in the old House of Representatives, in Statuary Hall, was Thomas Jefferson's first original draft, where he had erased things so hard, like public property to turn into pursuit of happiness, that he wore out the page and glued in a little strip, like I used to do in grade school, and then rewrote on top of it. And when I would walk over to the Senate, I would pass Thomas Jefferson's original draft, in the center of the old House Chamber, and just run my hand across the top of the plastic case, and within seconds I am looking at the Magna Carta. [[Page H 14233]] When they took it home, they left the gold reproduction that is still in the Rotunda. We are still learning things here about the abuse of power and about the quotes that Mrs. Chenoweth was just reading to me over here, and we will get to them later, when my hour starts, about our forefathers. We throw that off so flippantly in school, the Founders, and then the Framers. And trying to be politically correct, I always try to throw in an Abigail Adams and the terrific wives that did not get the vote until 1920, but they were weighing in with their opinions, and they were all talking about King George III. Excellent Academy Award movie about him losing his marbles right in front of everybody's eyes. But this is not kingly power. And, remember, that when all these great thinkers in the beginning of that age of enlightenment, at least there was enlightenment over here and a reign of terror in Paris, they said their concept of a Commander in Chief was George Washington; a self-term-limiting man, two terms, a man who knew his limitations, and who was such a towering person of character, not with the intellectual ability to muse about things like Benjamin Franklin or Thomas Jefferson, but a tall character that presided over the Continental Congress in uniform. He was not puffed up about his uniform. He told people this lends me a little aura of dignity to settle some of these disputes here. That is who they were thinking of when they talked about Commander in Chief, not this person down there in the White House who thinks he is going to coast this entire year making our life miserable vetoing everything except defense bills. We got him locked on that because of Bosnia. Mr. HORN. He let that become law without his signature. Mr. DORNAN. That is right. He thinks he has an escape valve there somehow, so he can whine to other people about things in there that he did not want. By the way, and then I wan to turn to one of my other colleagues, people say how can he be so cavalier about where the money is coming for this? Not just the men on the ground, and I know I am annoying people I am saying it so much, but I want it in people's heads that I am not an isolationist. I am not echoing Pat Buchanan. I do want to help in Europe, and we are in there with air strikes. That is called air power. Sea power in the Adriatic, more than everybody else in the world combined. Airlift, sealift, fuel, food. I have walked in the hospitals in Zagreb. We are ready for massive casualties. Intelligence is dotting the ``I'' all right. It is 99, 98 percent ours. And we have 500 men and women as a blocking action in Macedonia wearing those Blue Berets. We are involved at great cost. Put yourself in Clinton's shoes. He did not want $7 billion in that defense appropriations. He started out saying this will cost a billion. A week ago it was 2. Today it is 4. He still thinks he has $3 billion to burn. There is $7 billion in defense appropriations for this 1 year that started October 1 that he does not want there. If he burned up $7 billion in this operation, he is back to where he wanted the defense appropriations bill anyway. Mr. GANSKE. Reclaiming my time, if the gentleman would allow me, I think the thing that will be on most of our constituents' minds in just a few weeks, unless Congress asserts the authority that it should, and that takes courage from the Congress to do this, as the gentleman from California was saying, but unless Congress at least has a full debate, up or down, should we be there, should we provide funding or not, then we will be. And I think what will be on our constituents' minds 2 or 3 weeks from now are the men and women in a cold, windy, mountainous, dangerous place at Christmas. And this is a long commitment that we are talking about. The French have recognized the reality of this situation. They have basically said we recognize this is not a short-term proposition. The disputed areas held by the Serbs all around Sarajevo is a situation where the Serbs do not want to leave. We, the French, understand that this could be a 10, 15, 20-year commitment. Remember the history in this area. A dictator with an iron hand ruled this country for 50 years. Peace was maintained. One might think that in a 50-year period of enforced peace that the various ethnic factions could begin to put aside their traditional centuries-old hatreds. And yet, as soon as that discipline was gone, we were back to a civil war. Mr. DORNAN. If the gentleman would yield for a second, can I show him something about these hatreds that is very upsetting? And I called to California to ask 1 of my 10 grandchildren to watch, because you do not have to meet one of my grandchildren, named Kevin Griffin, to know what he looks like. Here is his picture in both Time and in Newsweek, and taken by different photographers, I might add. Because these cameras will not zoom in this year, we will change that next year, I am going to pass these to Mrs. Chenoweth. This is my grandson in San Juan Capistrano, Kevin Griffin, and he is a refugee, a Moslem refugee from Srebrenica that fled to Tuzla, where we will be. They look at our American GIs that arrived there the other day to a welcome, the 1st Armored Division, and they want to just touch the Americans. Now, look at that blond haired, blue-eyed boy. And I am not giving any preferences, because I have Robert K. Dornan, III, here in Virginia, who is one-quarter Croatian with huge brown eyes. He is going to get a great tan and has dark hair. I have grandkids of all sizes and shapes, and 5 females and 5 males and a fifth female on the way, number 10, I think. I am asking my son not to tell me. But, of course, the hatreds are there and they are so intermarried for 600 years that if I look at somebody and I say, well, this guy has red hair, what, is he Irish? And they say, oh, he is a Moslem. No, sorry, he is Croatian. No, that is right, he is Serbian. And they are all killing one another based on traditions that are pathetic. I just got informed by our chief of everything here, Ron Lasch, that I had the misimpression that I have an hour coming up. {time} 1915 The gentleman took our second hour, and he has got about 15 minutes left, and then I can take a 5. The gentleman from California already had his 5, but Helen can take a 5, and that is about it. I do have something newsworthy and earthshaking. This morning I got a call from a friend in New York. They said the National Review magazine, dated Christmas Day, that goes in the mail because it is fortnightly, tomorrow has an article from an eyewitness at Dayton that will absolutely boggle your mind. It is called ``Yalta in the Balkans.'' He says there was a secret deal. This is starting to leak out now. I do not believe Mr. Warren Christopher, Secretary of State, knew. I think he was kept out of the loop by his number 2, Strobe Talbott, whose foreign policy has always been Soviets first, and now Russia first. He is fluent in Russian. Translated Khrushchev's memoirs when he was at Oxford with Clinton. He did the translating for this secret deal. The deal is: Poland go to hell; and Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, you will not be in an expanded NATO. Let me read some of this, because I think this is really hot, newsworthy stuff. I have taken it over to the Senators. My pal, Bob Dole, is in turmoil over there, because he is trying to drive the policy to make sure we arm the victims who have had all of those atrocities committed. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to put it in the Record. I will end the opening paragraphs, one gusty one at the close, then we will talk about it. Peter W. Rodman, a former national security adviser to both presidents Bush and to President Reagan. One of the better arguments for the Dayton Accords and the dispatching of U.S. troops to Bosnia was that putting the Bosnian conflict on ice would serve larger American strategic interests. One such interest was the future of the Western alliance. We are being browbeaten with this. The prolongation of the Bosnia war and the squabbles among allies were poisonous to the Alliance itself, and the resulting incoherence of policy was poisonous to NATO's credibility. A second key strategic was the enlargement of NATO into Central Europe and the prolongation of this Bosnian war was complicating this.'' During the climactic NATO bombing operations in September, starting in August, Boris Yeltsin gave a tempestuous news conference in which he conflated the two issues, [[Page H 14234]] blustering that an enlarged NATO would soon be dropping bombs on Russia's doorstep. The Dayton accords offer us a chance, in other words, to put all of this behind us and to refocus our European policy on larger concerns. The next three paragraphs are priceless, but in the interest of time, I will put them in the Record. It says this: As usual, the administration has its strategic priorities totally bass-backwards. This guy is writing tough street words. It is wrong to pay a price to Russia over Bosnia in the strategic coin of our larger interest in consolidating security in Central Europe. It is wrong to sacrifice NATO enlargement to the Russians over Bosnia or anything else. The administration's repeated assurances to Congress, and to the allies, that Russia would not have a veto over NATO enlargement turned out to be empty. Perhaps is just another of the ``terminological inexactitudes,'' that is the Clinton administration dialogue, that have become so familiar. A huge price will ultimately be paid for this. There is no current threat to Central Europe. The newly liberated states of the region, however, have just recently awakened from a 60-year nightmare. Still find themselves situated between Germany and Russia, and know in their bones that their survival is not guaranteed by history. They consider themselves part of the West culturally, politically, and morally and, therefore, seek Western assurances that we feel a stake in their security and independence. Seen in this light, NATO enlargement is not a new act, but a consolidation of the post-1989 status quo. They are free. This is Poland, Hungary, et al., sovereign countries exercising their free sovereign choice to associate with us. Either Russia accepts this, or does not. Three more great paragraphs in the Record. Call your Congressman and ask for it. Mr. Speaker, here is the punch line. By fear of antagonizing Russia, bad faith, whatever the short-term plot is for putting Bosnia on ice, in Central Europe we are seeing a strategic blunder of historic proportions. Mr. Speaker, this is the hidden deal at Dayton, OH. Mr. Speaker, I submit the following article for inclusion in the Record. [From the National Review, Dec. 25, 1995] Yalta in the Balkans (By Peter W. Rodman) Washington, DC.--One of the better arguments for the Dayton Accords and the dispatching of U.S. troops to Bosnia was that putting the Bosnia conflict on ice would serve larger American strategic interests. One such interest was the future of the Western alliance: the prolongation of the Bosnia war and the squabbles among the Allies were poisonous to the Alliance itself, and the resulting incoherence of Western policy was poisonous to NATO's credibility. A second key strategic interest was the enlargement of NATO into Central Europe, and prolongation of the Bosnia war was also complicating this (During the climatic NATO bombing operations in September, Boris Yeltsin gave a tempestuous news conference in which he conflated the two issues, blustering that an enlarged NATO would soon be dropping bombs on Russia's doorstep.) The Dayton Accords offer us a chance, in other words, to put all this behind us and to re-focus our European policy on our larger concerns. These arguments for Dayton still hold, but National Review has learned of a stunningly duplicitous turn in the Clinton Administration's policy toward Russia, Bosnia, and the Atlantic Alliance: The President and his associates are reported to have given Moscow secret assurances that, in return for its cooperation with the U.S. in Bosnia peacekeeping, NATO enlargement will be put ``on the back burner'' for the foreseeable future. The rationale was that, given this demonstration of Russia's readiness to be a partner in a new cooperative ``European security architecture,'' the extension of NATO security guarantees to Central Europe would not be a priority any time soon. This account comes from official and authoritative sources, both Russian and American. It has long been understood (indeed, admitted by some Administration officials) that concrete decisions on admitting new NATO members would be put off until after the Russian elections, especially the presidential election scheduled for June 1996--which meant, as a practical matter, until after the U.S. presidential election as well. Russian officials interpret the new assurances to mean that if Mr. Clinton is re-elected, nothing will happen on NATO enlargement in his second term either. The story is accompanied by reports of other assurances to the Russians that their cooperation on Bosnia would put the United States in their debt and earn them greater American understanding on other issues, such as their reassertion of control in their ``near abroad'' (Central Asia and the Caucasus, including the oil-rich Caspian basin). As usual, this Administration has its strategic priorities totally bass-ackwards. It is wrong to pay a price to Russia over Bosnia in the strategic coin of our larger interest in consolidating security in Central Europe. It is wrong to sacrifice NATO enlargement to the Russians over Bosnia or over anything else. The Administration's repeated assurances to Congress and to the Allies that Russia would not have a veto over NATO enlargement turn out to be empty--perhaps just another of the ``terminological inexactitudes'' that have become so familiar. A huge price will ultimately be paid for this. There is no current threat to Central Europe. The newly liberated states of the region, however, have just recently awakened from a 60-year nightmare, still find themselves situated between Germany and Russia, and know in their bones that their survival is not guaranteed by history. They consider themselves part of the West culturally, politically, and morally; they therefore seek Western assurances that we feel a stake in their security and independence. Seen in this light, NATO enlargement is not a new act, but a consolidation of the post-1989 status quo: they are free, sovereign countries exercising their free, sovereign choice to associate with us. Either Russia accepts this, or it does not. Leaving the security status of Central Europe ambiguous only leaves open temptations to Russian irredentists. NATO membership for Central Europe is among other things a way of telling the Russians that their acceptance of the post-1989 status quo in Central Europe is the sine qua non of any relationship with us. If the Russians have a problem with this--which they clearly seem to have--then we are all facing a major problem five or ten years down the road as Russia regains its strength. The Administration's rationale for delaying NATO enlargement has been twofold. One is the claim that it will be easier to achieve such enlargement if we go about it gradually. But the nationalist turn in Russian politics, expected to be given new impetus by the December elections for the Duma, tells us that it will not get any easier. Russia is only getting stronger and more assertive; every month, the risks and inhibitions on our side will only grow. The Administration's second rationale (at least, so I suspect) is what philosophy majors will remember as Zeno's Paradox: the idea that if you divide a distance into an infinite number of tiny increments, you never get to the destination. This may be the Administration's real calculation. In other words, it just doesn't want to enlarge NATO--for fear of antagonizing Moscow. The first rationale is bad judgment; the second is bad faith. Whatever the short-term plaudits due to the Administration for putting the Bosnia conflict on ice, in Central Europe we are seeing a strategic blunder of historic proportions. Mr. GANSKE. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time for a moment, I think the gentleman has pointed out, as I did in my initial statement, that possibly the worst thing that could happen from our getting more involved is that we now have increased the proximity to some significant interactions with the Russians. The United States troops will be positions in this area right here, very close to the Russian troops that will be in this area. Mrs. Chenoweth and I will be looking at this area this weekend. But, remember, General Clark informed us in a briefing that approximately one-third of NATO forces will be tied up in this endeavor. Now, there is a great deal of unrest in Russia. What happens if later this year there is a significant turnover in power and then we have a problem not in the Balkans, but in the Baltics, and we have this type of commitment? I mean, it is a matter of weighing some real significant options. Mr. Speaker, with that, I would yield to the gentlewoman from Idaho [Mrs. Chenoweth]. Mrs. CHENOWETH. Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting as we stop and think about the tests that we have been talking about, that the President, as Commander in Chief, simply has not passed. And one of those major tests is what I call the mother's test. I guess my major claim to fame is the fact that I am a mother. I am a mother of a military man who would respond to the command of his Commander in Chief, because that is the way he has been raised. But my heart breaks to think of mothers across this Nation having to let their sons and daughters go because of a President who does not understand what his role is and the role of the military, his responsibility as Commander in Chief; because, since the beginning of civilization, mothers have been willing to send their sons off to war to protect the interests of the country or the tribe or the community, to preserve the peace and tranquility of their existence, to make sure that freedom and liberty will reign for their future generation. That silent mother's test. But he has failed the mother's test. He has even failed the test of his own Secretary of State, who back in 1992 stated that we will commit troops only upon the following four criteria: No 1, [[Page H 14235]] is he said if the mission is clearly defined; No. 2, would be if the people in this country are behind the mission; No. 3, is if there was a very clear and reasonable chance for success; and No. 4 is if there is a good, strong exit strategy. All four of those the President fails on. And probably, Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentleman, the biggest failure is what will this do to the spirit of the military? The spirit of the military has been captured by a speech given by General MacArthur. I would like to quote just a paragraph from a great general who really understood warfare, understood how necessary it was for the general to take responsibility for his troops in the field. On May 12, 1962, in his speech, ``Duty, Honor, and Country,'' General MacArthur said, ``And through all of this,'' he said this to the graduates at West Point, he said: And through all of this welter of change and development that you will face, your mission remains fixed, determined, and it is to win our wars. Everything else in your professional career is but a corollary to this vital dedication. All other public purposes, all other public projects, all other public needs, great or small, will find others for their accomplishment, but profession of arms, the will to win, the sure knowledge that in war there is no substitute for victory, and that if you lose, the Nation will be destroyed. What are we setting our troops up for? Are we disspiriting our troops? Are we putting ourselves on a slippery slope, like we did in Vietnam, where we never have recovered economically, like the post- Vietnam wars? And the spirit of America took a hit that we were not even able to begin to recover until we had a President like Ronald Reagan who could really again show us how we could go in and win with the likes of Colin Powell and Dick Cheney. Mr. GANSKE. I thank the gentlewoman, and I am sure your phone calls have been the same as mine: overwhelmingly against this. The public does not understand the reason that we should be there, and my phone calls are 8 or 9 to 1 against this. Time and time again, people are phoning saying, do not do this. We do not understand. We think you will not accomplish anything of significance. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. HORN. Well, Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentleman, we have exactly the same experience, and I know a lot of our Democratic friends had that experience. The other day one representative, when asked how many letters do you get on this subject and what are they saying, she said all of them are against, 100 percent; not even one or two out of 100 supporting it. And I think the wisdom of the people in this case is right on the mark. People are not stupid. They know where our national interests ought to lie. No one has convinced us that American lives are at stake, even though Bosnia is one of the most tragic situations in the world. So was Cambodia, so were a number of places, so are those places right now in Asia and the Mideast and Africa. But we cannot be, as I said earlier today, super cop to the world, and that is sort of what we are getting ourselves into. Mr. GANSKE. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield for a minute, there is an option. The option is something that Senator Dole, for instance, recommended a couple of years ago, and that was make for a level playing field. Lift the arms embargo. Allow the various factions to have a level playing field and to settle their own civil war with the same type of support that we have done in the past, logistical and air, and yet not interpose ourselves into the middle of essentially a civil war. Mr. HORN. Mr. Speaker, one of our most successful operations, as the gentleman knows, happened under the Carter administration. It is ironic that many of the advisers of President Carter also are advising this administration. But what they did that was successful, they began the effort to provide arms to the Afghan Mujaheddin, and through Pakistan they did just that as really a covert operation without using American troops, and they were able to have sufficient arms go in that the world's second strongest superpower was driven out of Afghanistan where it never should have been in the first place. Mr. GANSKE. Mr. Speaker, let me summarize, and I thank my colleagues for joining me in this colloquy. I believe that this mission is primarily going to involve a breathing space for the warring parties. They need to rearm. They will do that on a brief enforced peace. I think at the end of the day it is not that America cannot tolerate casualties; it is that Americans just do not tolerate casualties unless they can see a real purpose. ","['The SPEAKER ', 'pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Ganske] is recognized for 60 minutes. ', 'Mr. GANSKE.', "" Mr. Speaker, we are facing today debate on two big issues, the two B's, the two great B's, the budget and Bosnia. Since we have had some debate tonight on the budget, let me just spend a few minutes before I move on to the second B, Bosnia. There has been a lot of misperception about what exactly is in the budget that Congress has passed. But let me give you the facts. In 1995, we spend for Medicare $178 billion. This will go up every year for the next 7 years, so that by the year 2002 we will spend $290 billion for Medicare. This is an increase by anyone's calculations. In the last 7 years, we have spent $926 billion on Medicare. In the next 7 years, we will spend $1.6 trillion. This is at twice the rate of inflation. Just a couple of years ago, President Clinton, in speaking to the country about his health care plan at that time, said anything goes up at twice the rate of inflation is not a cut. {time} 1830 Let us look at some other areas. Medicaid, 1995, we have spent $90 billion. This will increase every year for the next 7 years so that by the year 2002 we will be spending $127 billion. In the last 7 years, for Medicaid, we have spent $444 billion, and we propose increasing that to $770 billion in the next 7 years. That is an increase of $330 billion. "", 'SHOULD WE ', 'SEND TROOPS ', 'TO BOSNIA?', ' But let me get to the second issue, the issue of Bosnia. Let me begin with the basic issue. Should we or should we not put United States troops into Bosnia? Let us look at the various arguments President Clinton has laid before the public and why I believe they are flawed. I have given the President the benefit of the doubt. I have listened carefully to United States negotiators, Richard Holbrooke and General Clark, and have discussed this issue with several Congressmen who have just returned from ', 'Bosnia. I ', ""am indebted to Charles Krauthammer's testimony on Bosnia recently before the House Committee on National Security, and to Michael Glenon's article on foreign affairs a few years ago on the role of Congress and war. Despite Mr. Holbrooke's protestations, the deal calls for Bosnia and Herzegovina to be partitioned by a 2-mile wide demilitarized zone, a DMZ that "", 'NATO ', 'will patrol. There will be a Croat-Moslem coalition and a Serb republic with a weak central government for show. ', 'The NATO ', 'troops can kill anyone who stands in the way of separation or is presumed to constitute a threat. Approximately 60,000 troops, one-third English, one-third French, and one-third United States troops, will be on the ground. As many as 37,000 United States troops may ultimately be involved, and American reservists will be part of the operation, including some from my home State of Iowa. Up to one-third of current ', 'NATO ', ""forces may be committed to this venture. Let us examine the reasons that President Clinton, in his speech to the American people, gave for putting the lives of American troops into harm's way. First, in comparing the current situation in Sarajevo to World "", 'War I,', "" President Clinton said, ``We must never go down the road of isolationism again.'' Now to argue that if we do not put troops on the ground into Bosnia will lead to United States isolationism ignores the facts. The United States is robustly internationalist today as compared to the Smooth-Hawley days of protectionism. Look at United States involvement in "", 'GATT,', ' United States involvement in ', 'NAFTA,', "" the $20 billion Mexico bailout or the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. Indeed, many would argue that the United States has been too internationalist in areas such as the 1993 Somalia fiasco or Lebanon in 1982. Was the United States not involved in Grenada in 1983, in Panama in 1989, and in the Persian Gulf in 1991? How can one talk about isolationism when we have troops in Haiti? Second, President Clinton invoked the moral imperative; sending United States troops to Bosnia is ``the right thing to do.'' It is true that for 3 years atrocities have been committed by both sides in a terrible civil war. Television has brought these horrors into our living rooms just as it brought the horrors of Vietnam into our homes 25 years ago. Our hearts go out to the victims, and compassion cries out for action. Yet, wise leadership calls for more than compassion in a world torn by strife in a dozen or more places around the Earth. What is the difference between Bosnia and Rwanda, Bosnia and Liberia or the Sudan, Bosnia and Peru, Bosnia and Sri "", 'Lanka? I ', ""was recently in Guatemala, where an insurrection has gone on for years. There are victims in all of these places that tug at our hearts. How do we decide where to put American troops at risk? I believe that the American people support the use of troops overseas for very specific purposes only, to honor our treaties, to protect the lives of Americans overseas, to defend our country, and to protect our national security and interests. This brings us to the third part of President Clinton's argument, ``Generations of Americans have understood that Europe's freedom and stability is vital to our own national security. That is why we fought two wars in Europe.'' Basically, President Clinton is resurrecting the domino theory for the "", 'Balkans. I ', 'ask, what evidence is there for the spread of this war? This civil war has been going on for 3 years, and there is no evidence for its spread. This is not 1914. The situation is totally different. There is no European interest in the Balkans other than the major powers staying out of a confrontation with each other. Fourth, the President says, ``', ""As NATO'"", 's leader and the primary broker of the peace agreement, the United States must be an essential part of the [[', 'Page H ', ""14230]] mission.'' Inherent in the President's argument is the rationalization that the United States has an obligation to assist its "", 'NATO ', 'allies whose troops are already on the ground. I think this is dubious reasoning. In the first place, the United States has no ', 'NATO ', 'treaty commitments to policing a civil war in the Balkans. Second, Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staffs, concedes that from a purely military standpoint the West European nations could undertake the Bosnian mission on their own. Third, going forward with deployment could actually be worse to ', 'NATO ', 'than the damage of nondeployment. Krauthammer argues that deployment could result in one or two humiliations; first a humiliating retreat, as in the case of Somalia and Lebanon, in which our allies were left high and dry; or, second, we go in and then persist in a thankless, unwinnable, and costly operation that erodes the solidarity of the alliance. More than 200 U.N. troops have already been killed in ', 'Bosnia. U.', 'S. generals warn that there will be casualties. ', 'When U.', 'S. body bags start coming home and television interviews American amputees, where will the support be in the United States for ', 'NATO?', "" The motives of the Bosnian accord are morally worthy. Who could not help but want to bring peace to those suffering war victims? Yet, as a political leader and as the Commander in Chief, the President has a responsibility not just to try to do good but also to have undertaken a mission that has a reasonable chance of success. By all reports, enforcing this agreement is going to be a tactical nightmare. I recently spoke to a United States Senator who served in Vietnam and is just back from a fact-finding mission in Bosnia. He described the mountainous, forested terrain as some of the most difficult to fight in that he is seen. The difficult terrain will negate a lot of the technological advantage that our forces have. Our equipment will be too heavy for most of the roads and bridges. Winter weather conditions will complicate air superiority, and there are an estimated 6 million unmarked land mines. This map of Bosnia illustrates several areas that are problematic. The red line represents the demilitarized zone. We have several areas here that are worrisome. We have an area, Gorazde, which is primarily Moslem. This is totally surrounded by Serb territory, and yet we have created a corridor in which there supposedly will be no Serbian arms. Another problem area will be the narrow corridor up by Brcko. Another area of great concern is the area surrounding Sarajevo controlled by the Serbs, none of whom are happy with this agreement. The hair-trigger task of separating the warring parties is supposed to take place in the first 30 days, before most of the main occupying force has arrived. Will the U.S. troops play local cop? I ask this question because during the occupation of Haiti a year ago American soldiers had to stand back and watch while thugs beat up local citizens. Will our troops in Bosnia be forced to watch atrocities just outside the DMZ line that they are guarding? If the participants want peace, why do we need to send an armored division? The answer, of course, is that as Assistant Secretary of State Holbrooke has admitted that arms had to be twisted to get the agreement signed by the Bosnians and the Serbs. Recent news reports document that the parties to this agreement are not very happy with the territorial provisions, and as Mr. Krauthammer has said so forcefully, if you are unhappy with the imposed peace, there is nothing like blowing up 241 Marines or killing 18 U.S. Rangers to make your point. Killing Americans is a faster way to victory than killing your traditional enemy. This brings us to the question: What role should Congress play in the Bosnia problem? Without getting into a long discussion of the constitutional law and the War Powers Act, it is clear that the Founding Fathers were fearful that the executive branch is most interested in war and most prone to it. This is why the Constitution invests the war powers with Congress. Jefferson, in a letter to Madison, wrote, ``We have already given an example of one effectual check to the dog of war by transferring the power of letting him loose from the executive to the legislative body, from those who are to spend to those who are to pay.'' One obvious advantage Congress brings to the decision whether to participate in these warlike endeavors is that Congress represents the diversity of opinion of the country. President Lincoln knew the value of diverse opinion and legislative deliberation. He said, ``In a certain sense and to a certain extent, the President is the representative of the people. He is elected by them, as well as Congress is. But can he, in the nature of things, know the wants of the people as well as 300 other men coming from all the various localities of the Nation? If so, where is the propriety of having a Congress?'' Mr. Speaker, the wiser course of action is not to put American troops on the ground. What we should do is lift the arms embargo. The Secretary of State has said recently that we will arm the Bosnians, if necessary, but we hope it is not necessary. Well, Mr. Speaker, it probably will be necessary, and we will then be viewed as taking sides. We already are not viewed as neutral by the Bosnian Serbs, but we also do not have troops at risk right now. In summary, Mr. Speaker, while our motives are good, I fear that putting American troops on the ground in the middle of a civil war, where ethnic hatreds run deep, where the technical details of the plan are suspect, where a time-limited cease-fire is likely to resume into full-fledged war once our troops are gone and where there is no clear- cut U.S. interest is just plain wrong. My constituents have told me, ``Stop don't do this. Do not send American troops on a mission they can't win, for reasons we don't understand.'' {time} 1845 Vietnam veteran James Smith recently wrote about his son, who was killed in Somalia: As my sacrifice was wasted in Vietnam and my son's sacrifice was wasted in Somalia, will there be more wasted sacrifices in Bosnia? This old soldier is not convinced. I cannot support sending troops to Bosnia. This Congressman has similar concerns. I beg the House leadership to give this Congress the right to vote on a resolution that would stop the deployment of U.S. troops now, and I beg the President to reconsider his decision. It is not too late. Throughout this debate we will hear many arguments for the need to support our troops. Let me be clear that I share this commitment that every Member of this body has toward the young men and women who will risk their lives to defend our freedoms. This weekend I will be in Bosnia with a congressional delegation, and as a physician who is in the Army reserve medical corps, I will be especially interested in the military medical preparations. If United States troops do end up in "", 'Bosnia, I ', 'want to know how to best support them. But let me also be clear, that on the basis of my current knowledge, I believe that we can support our troops best by not sending them to Bosnia. This mission is simply breathing space before the next round in fighting. Congress should do all it can to stop this action. At the end of the day, it is not that Americans cannot tolerate casualties. It is that Americans do not tolerate casualties for nothing. With that, I would yield to the gentlewoman from Idaho. ', 'Mrs. CHENOWETH.', ' I thank the gentleman for yielding. I appreciate his good comments, and I look forward to joining the gentleman and some other of the Members in our trip to Bosnia to look at the situation firsthand this weekend. I think that it is so incredibly important to be able to see what our troops are going to be going through and to be able to visit with our troops in Frankfort, not only to encourage our troops, but also to be meeting with the heads of State of the warring factions. Mr. ', 'Speaker, I ', 'am of firm belief that the President in this case is not using the constitutional authority given to him and is abusing the power that was given to him by the ', 'Constitution. I ', 'have asked over and over and over again to have constitutional scholars show me where the President has the authority to commit military troops to the mission that he has in ', 'Bosnia. I ', 'cannot find anyone who can show me, outside of case law, and very vague [[', 'Page H ', ""14231]] case law, not on point to what the President has declared to be our mission in Bosnia, which is, interestingly enough, not to keep the peace, because there has not been peace there since before the Roman Empire, when the Romans were trying to maintain peace in that area. But we will be enforcing the peace by the President's own words. Now, you cannot enforce the peace without committing war to enforce peace. That is what war is. That is why we are arming our troops to go to "", 'Bosnia. I ', 'have been very pleased to listen to Mr. Dornan from California on many of his special order speeches as he compares the other commitments by the other ', 'NATO ', 'nations. I look forward to a colloquy with Mr. Dornan on the other commitments by the other ', 'NATO ', ""nations, as well as getting into what the President's authority really is, because this "", 'President, I ', 'maintain, does not have the authority. He is maintaining his leadership by assertion, not by law, and certainly not by constitutional law. ', 'Mr. GANSKE.', "" Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I would like to followup on the gentlewoman's comments. There is precedent over the past 200 years for the President occasionally doing military exercises, that is, Presidents have sent forces against the Barbary pirates. There have been missions sent out with the various expansions of our country. There are quite a few examples. But it seems to me that there does come a time, and there is a line that needs to be drawn in the definition of what is a police action and what is a very, very significant military action. When we are putting a division of forces on the ground in the middle of a civil war in the Balkans, when we are talking about 37,000 American troops involved, this is not a small operation. I believe it was clearly the intent of the Founding Fathers that in something of this magnitude, it was inherent in the Constitution, which gives Congress the right to declare war, the dominant position in terms of deciding whether we send American men and women overseas into harm's way. With that, I will be happy to yield to the distinguished gentleman from California [Mr. Dornan], a Vietnam veteran, somebody who has spoken eloquently on the role of the military, who may desire to also further enlighten us on the relationship between Congress and the Executive, who has been through some of the vigorous discussions related to the War Powers Act and other things, but who also I think can significantly add to this discussion in terms of some of the technical details and what exactly we are getting into. "", 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' Dr. ', 'Ganske, I ', ""appreciate your yielding to me. I enjoyed getting to know you at a dinner in your district and seeing that beautiful great turn-of-the-century house that you live in, and knowing that as a healer of people, you, like all of us here on both sides of the aisle, of every ideological persuasion, are terrified of how quickly this could take a bad turn, not even any worse than the streets of Mogadishu, 19 young men dead, and another 90 carrying wounds, some more severe than others, the rest of their life. This is a wonderful opportunity, during the first massive change of leadership in the House in 40 years, since I was a 21-year-old pilot in the very first election of my life, this House has been controlled by one ideology and one party, and now we get a shift. We have the Nation's attention, watching the political process, with this majestic C-"", 'SPAN ', ""broadcast of this, the world's greatest deliberative body, with all due respect to that gorgeous building on the Thames, the mother of parliaments, and we have a chance to educate one another. Now, if there was someone who fell down in the entrance way, and their lips started to turn blue and they had a heart attack, there is not much I could do except scream for you or Dr. Weldon or Dr. Coburn and say, ``Come here, Greg, what do you do? I will hold people back.'' But let me tell you what you just said. I was only educated about 48 hours ago. My pal John McCain during the Haiti invasion invoked Thomas Jefferson as you just did, starting with our third President in 1801, his very first few months in office, that we can go in some instances, because, look, Jefferson did it. McCain did it again, our friend John McCain, served here honorably for years, a fine Senator, a western Senator, just south of Idaho down there in Arizona, he said again on Brinkley this weekend, ``Look what Jefferson did with the Barbary pirates.'' That is not only bad history; it is so wrong it is frightening. A scholar with a published book on Presidential war power that anybody can get from the Library of Congress, this one is printed by the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Lewis Fisher, brings me over his book, this scholar from our Congressional Research Service, and gives me a paper that was dated last year, a year and a half ago, in response to Haiti, and McCain and others saying well, Jefferson did this, and it turns out that our friend with his big medallion right up here, Thomas Jefferson, right above the speaker, honored as one of our 23 lawmakers, Jefferson said, ``I can't do anything that is offensive or attacking in nature. I can only respond to an attack on the United States and defend it.'' That is pretty vital interest, an attack. He said, ``I need help on the Barbary pirates.'' The House of Representatives not only passed resolutions; they turned it into public law, and one of them was the very day before Jefferson was inaugurated, in those days, right up through Rossevelt's second term, was March 4, on March 3, 1801, when Haiti, by the way, it was then called Santa Dominique, was exploding in bloodshed, a result of the French reign of terror, had now come to Haiti, where the slaves killed every single European heritage person on the whole island of Hispaniola. That includes what is today called Santa Domingo, the Dominican Republic. While that turmoil is going on, Thomas Jefferson gets a law passed the day before he is sworn in that says in effect, go get the Barbary pirates. Nine more public laws, pushing him as it pushed the single termer that he beat, John Adams, before. So we have got to get this scholarship, and that is why I asked Helen, who sat there with you as a freshman on this historic day. On the 53d anniversary of Pearl Harbor, today is the 54th, Newt Gingrich told you, Dr. Ganske of Iowa and Helen Chenoweth of Idaho, to read the Federalist Papers. It made me want to go back and read it. Steve Horn, who has joined us, near me in the Long Beach area of California, did not have to read it, he teaches it. He taught it as a professor for years. Wait until we look tonight briefly at the Federalist Papers again. Helen Chenoweth, would you please read Alexander Hamilton, another father of our country, and see what he says about the limit on our Chief Executive, because kings in England, and queens, declared war at will, how we wanted to take power away from our Chief Executive. "", 'Mrs. CHENOWETH.', ' Thank you, Mr. ', 'Dornan. I ', ""was very pleased to be able to read the Federalist Papers, and I turn to them often, because in Federalist No. 69, Alexander Hamilton did say this: ``The President is to be the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States. In this respect, his authority would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great Britain, but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces as first the general and admiral of the confederacy, while that of the British king extends to declaring war and to raising and regulating fleets and armies, all which by the Constitution under consideration would appertain to the legislature,'' this body, Mr. Dornan. Further, Abraham Lincoln, in writing to his law partner in 1837, William Herndon, wrote this. It is very interesting. ``The provisions of the Constitution giving the war making power to Congress was dictated as I understand it by the following reasons: Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object. This our Convention understood to be the most oppressive of all kingly oppressions, and they resolved to frame the Constitution so that no one should hold [["", 'Page H ', ""14232]] the power of bringing that oppression upon us.'' "", 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' Mr. ', 'Ganske, I ', 'find that that oppression is being brought upon us by a man who would deem to be king. ', 'Mr. GANSKE.', "" If the gentlewoman would yield, I think this shows the essential wisdom of the Founding Fathers, because they understood that it is a lot easier to get involved in wars than it is to get out of wars. They did not want this power to be concentrated in the hands of one individual. Very specifically during the constitutional debates, they decided to vest that authority in the House of the people, in Congress, and over the years this has slipped, as has been mentioned. I think, however, there were some very important lessons that all of us learned about 25 years ago, and that was that in order to sustain an overseas military operation or effort, you have to have the American people behind you. They have to be committed. It is like I said before, the American people, if they know that they are fighting for a cause that is justified by U.S. interests or fulfilling treaty commitments, can sustain casualties. We have shown that many times in our Nation's history, with some of the highest casualties ever. The problem that we have with this current situation is that, quite frankly, the administration has not made the case to the American people that we have an overwhelming national interest in this area or that we have commitments, treaty, contractual commitments, that obligate us to this course of action, or that in the long run, after 6 months, 8 months, a year, when our forces are gone, that it will have made any difference 6 months or a year afterward. {time} 1900 "", 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' Somalia. ', 'Mr. GANSKE.', ' Somalia. ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' And maybe Haiti next year. ', 'Mr. GANSKE.', ' I think we are seeing a backing away from the current Haiti administration from a commitment that they had made before. ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield for a colloquy. ', 'Mr. GANSKE.', ' I yield to the gentleman. ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' I am not a lawyer, but I want to ask Professor Horn something, and before a lawyer would say, ah, reductio ad absurdum, sometimes, if you step back and carry something to the absurd, it really clarifies a point. Suppose, hypothetically, using all the arguments we have heard out of the White House, and some very excellent support that they got over the last couple of days from some of my conservative friends who have thrown up their hands using this phony Vietnam line, you have to support the troops, We all support the troops. I am still wearing my old Ironsides first armored division patch here. Of course, we support the troops. God love them. But here is my example. Suppose tomorrow President Clinton said, I cannot stand the pictures of any more of these little beautiful black babies dying in Rwanda. We have to go in there with force to protect the distribution of food. And, by the way, Somalia haunts me. I should not have been so weak over 19 deaths. This is a volunteer army, they are paid to take chances. By the way, we hear that. ', 'So I ', 'am going back into Somalia. And while we are at it, I think I am going to reinforce Haiti. It is starting to get squirrely there. Aristide is starting to disappoint me, Bill Clinton, so I am sending the 10th Mountain Division back into Haiti. Now, what is the difference, except that he is doing it in five places instead of two? He wants to go back in and reinforce Haiti, send the troops to Bosnia by Christmas, and go to Somalia and Rwanda. And once one person from an Air Force aircraft was on the ground, a loadmaster putting in supplies for the first GI to arrive, we would hear the cry, support the troops. Is his power, Steve Horn, utterly unlimited, since there has not been a declared war since 1941 tomorrow, on the 8th? And the one before that was this very day in the Senate on April 7, 1917. Is that it? No more declared wars? Imperial presidency? ', 'Mr. HORN.', ' Well, it is clear the President does not have that power, and only a rogue and a scoundrel would let a President have that power. And that is why Congress has to stand up, debate this one way or the other, and either by a majority vote give the President the authority in a special circumstance or deny the President the authority. As you suggest, Mr. Dornan, the bit of support our troops and waving it and saying that supports my policy in X, Y, or Z, is a true refuge for scoundrels and a misuse of the Presidency. And, of course, if it goes too far, and they just run over the Congress, as some Presidents have in the last generation, then I think somebody needs to get out the impeachment resolutions and say, thus, you will not go farther. It is very clear in the whole history of the United States that unless we are in a defensive mode, where we are attacked and must immediately respond, the President needs to consult the Congress. And as the gentleman suggested, the early precedents are quite clear. President Washington, who had commanded the revolutionary army, and knew, as the first President, that whatever he did was setting precedence for future Presidents, and Jefferson, as the gentleman will recall was his Secretary of State. ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' That is right. ', 'Mr. HORN.', "" And Adams, who was deeply involved in carrying on the federalist tradition after Washington, he, of course, was Vice President under Washington. So when Washington wanted to deal with an Indian tribe situation, which was the case in his time, he went to Congress and Congress gave that authority. That also happened with Adams. And as the gentleman says, when Jefferson got in, he convened his cabinet and listened to the arguments. Some of them wanted to give him more, quote, inherent power. Now, that game has been played by a lot of 20th century Presidents who say I have inherent power to do thus and so because I am either Chief Executive, or, more romantically, I am Commander in Chief. Utter nonsense. When President Truman tried to do that by seizing the steel mills in Youngstown Sheet and Tube versus Saywer, even his own friends on the court said, no, you cannot do that, Mr. President. As the gentleman will recall, they had a resolution flowing through here in no time to draft strikers into the military at that time. Cooler heads prevailed in the Senate. Interestingly enough the leader of that was Senator Taft of Ohio, who was very much disliked by labor at that time because he was the author of the Taft-Hartley Act. He said, wait a minute, you just cannot do that. That is improper conduct. Everybody cooled down, due to the Senate's cooling influences, and we went back to business as usual. It is simply wrong for Presidents to claim inherent power. That is king John at Runnymede, and that is why the barons reigned him in somewhat. Not necessarily for the people of England, but certainly for the barons of England. "", 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' Mr. Horn, for the younger people listening, I digress for something rather wonderful. ', 'When I ', ""got here, in 1977, the British had lent us one of the three surviving copies of the Magna Carta from June 1215 at Runnymede. That is about the time the Serbs started fighting the Ottoman Serbs. Well, a few years later. And it sat in the center of the rotunda from our bicentennial, when I had just won a primary in California, all the way through that year, through our Republican caucuses. And then there were only 19 in my class, and 19 in Henry Hyde's class before, and we were suffering unfairly. The American people were punishing the Hill for Richard Nixon, and not a single Congressman or Senator had a scintilla of guilt on what came to be called Watergate. But it sat there through my whole first 6 years. And also, in the old House of Representatives, in Statuary Hall, was Thomas Jefferson's first original draft, where he had erased things so hard, like public property to turn into pursuit of happiness, that he wore out the page and glued in a little strip, like I used to do in grade school, and then rewrote on top of it. And when I would walk over to the "", 'Senate, I ', ""would pass Thomas Jefferson's original draft, in the center of the old House Chamber, and just run my hand across the top of the plastic case, and within seconds I am looking at the Magna Carta. [["", 'Page H ', '14233]] When they took it home, they left the gold reproduction that is still in the Rotunda. We are still learning things here about the abuse of power and about the quotes that Mrs. Chenoweth was just reading to me over here, and we will get to them later, when my hour starts, about our forefathers. We throw that off so flippantly in school, the Founders, and then the Framers. And trying to be politically correct, I always try to throw in an Abigail Adams and the terrific wives that did not get the vote until 1920, but they were weighing in with their opinions, and they were all talking about King ', 'George III.', "" Excellent Academy Award movie about him losing his marbles right in front of everybody's eyes. But this is not kingly power. And, remember, that when all these great thinkers in the beginning of that age of enlightenment, at least there was enlightenment over here and a reign of terror in Paris, they said their concept of a Commander in Chief was George Washington; a self-term-limiting man, two terms, a man who knew his limitations, and who was such a towering person of character, not with the intellectual ability to muse about things like Benjamin Franklin or Thomas Jefferson, but a tall character that presided over the Continental Congress in uniform. He was not puffed up about his uniform. He told people this lends me a little aura of dignity to settle some of these disputes here. That is who they were thinking of when they talked about Commander in Chief, not this person down there in the White House who thinks he is going to coast this entire year making our life miserable vetoing everything except defense bills. We got him locked on that because of Bosnia. "", 'Mr. HORN.', ' He let that become law without his signature. ', 'Mr. DORNAN.', "" That is right. He thinks he has an escape valve there somehow, so he can whine to other people about things in there that he did not want. By the way, and then I wan to turn to one of my other colleagues, people say how can he be so cavalier about where the money is coming for this? Not just the men on the ground, and I know I am annoying people I am saying it so much, but I want it in people's heads that I am not an isolationist. I am not echoing Pat "", 'Buchanan. I ', ""do want to help in Europe, and we are in there with air strikes. That is called air power. Sea power in the Adriatic, more than everybody else in the world combined. Airlift, sealift, fuel, food. I have walked in the hospitals in Zagreb. We are ready for massive casualties. Intelligence is dotting the ``I'' all right. It is 99, 98 percent ours. And we have 500 men and women as a blocking action in Macedonia wearing those Blue Berets. We are involved at great cost. Put yourself in Clinton's shoes. He did not want $7 billion in that defense appropriations. He started out saying this will cost a billion. A week ago it was 2. Today it is 4. He still thinks he has $3 billion to burn. There is $7 billion in defense appropriations for this 1 year that started October 1 that he does not want there. If he burned up $7 billion in this operation, he is back to where he wanted the defense appropriations bill anyway. "", 'Mr. GANSKE.', "" Reclaiming my time, if the gentleman would allow me, I think the thing that will be on most of our constituents' minds in just a few weeks, unless Congress asserts the authority that it should, and that takes courage from the Congress to do this, as the gentleman from California was saying, but unless Congress at least has a full debate, up or down, should we be there, should we provide funding or not, then we will be. "", 'And I ', ""think what will be on our constituents' minds 2 or 3 weeks from now are the men and women in a cold, windy, mountainous, dangerous place at Christmas. And this is a long commitment that we are talking about. The French have recognized the reality of this situation. They have basically said we recognize this is not a short-term proposition. The disputed areas held by the Serbs all around Sarajevo is a situation where the Serbs do not want to leave. We, the French, understand that this could be a 10, 15, 20-year commitment. Remember the history in this area. A dictator with an iron hand ruled this country for 50 years. Peace was maintained. One might think that in a 50-year period of enforced peace that the various ethnic factions could begin to put aside their traditional centuries-old hatreds. And yet, as soon as that discipline was gone, we were back to a civil war. "", 'Mr. DORNAN.', ' If the gentleman would yield for a second, can I show him something about these hatreds that is very upsetting?

The gentleman from California already had his 5, but Helen can take a 5, and that is about it. I do have something newsworthy and earthshaking. This morning I got a call from a friend in New York. They said the National Review magazine, dated Christmas Day, that goes in the mail because it is fortnightly, tomorrow has an article from an eyewitness at Dayton that will absolutely boggle your mind. It is called ``Yalta in the Balkans.'' He says there was a secret deal. This is starting to leak out now. I do not believe Mr. Warren Christopher, Secretary of State, knew. I think he was kept out of the loop by his number 2, Strobe Talbott, whose foreign policy has always been Soviets first, and now Russia first. He is fluent in Russian. Translated Khrushchev's memoirs when he was at Oxford with Clinton. He did the translating for this secret deal. The deal is: Poland go to hell; and Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, you will not be in an expanded "", 'NATO.', ' Let me read some of this, because I think this is really hot, newsworthy stuff. I have taken it over to the Senators. My pal, Bob Dole, is in turmoil over there, because he is trying to drive the policy to make sure we arm the victims who have had all of those atrocities committed. Mr. ', 'Speaker, I ', 'ask unanimous consent to put it in the ', 'Record. I ', 'will end the opening paragraphs, one gusty one at the close, then we will talk about it.

[From the National Review, Dec. 25, 1995] Yalta in the Balkans (By ', 'Peter W.', ' Rodman) ', 'Washington, DC.', '--One of the better arguments for the Dayton Accords and the dispatching of U.S. troops to Bosnia was that putting the Bosnia conflict on ice would serve larger American strategic interests.

The Dayton Accords offer us a chance, in other words, to put all this behind us and to re-focus our European policy on our larger concerns. These arguments for Dayton still hold, but National Review has learned of a stunningly duplicitous turn in the Clinton Administration's policy toward Russia, Bosnia, and the Atlantic Alliance: The President and his associates are reported to have given Moscow secret assurances that, in return for its cooperation with the U.S. in Bosnia peacekeeping, "", 'NATO ', ""enlargement will be put ``on the back burner'' for the foreseeable future. The rationale was that, given this demonstration of Russia's readiness to be a partner in a new cooperative ``European security architecture,'' the extension of "", 'NATO ', 'security guarantees to Central Europe would not be a priority any time soon. This account comes from official and authoritative sources, both Russian and American. It has long been understood (indeed, admitted by some Administration officials) that concrete decisions on admitting new ', 'NATO ', 'members would be put off until after the Russian elections, especially the presidential election scheduled for June 1996--which meant, as a practical matter, until after the U.S. presidential election as well. Russian officials interpret the new assurances to mean that if Mr. Clinton is re-elected, nothing will happen on ', 'NATO ', ""enlargement in his second term either. The story is accompanied by reports of other assurances to the Russians that their cooperation on Bosnia would put the United States in their debt and earn them greater American understanding on other issues, such as their reassertion of control in their ``near abroad'' (Central Asia and the Caucasus, including the oil-rich Caspian basin). As usual, this Administration has its strategic priorities totally bass-ackwards.

Either Russia accepts this, or it does not. Leaving the security status of Central Europe ambiguous only leaves open temptations to Russian irredentists. ', 'NATO ', ""membership for Central Europe is among other things a way of telling the Russians that their acceptance of the post-1989 status quo in Central Europe is the sine qua non of any relationship with us. If the Russians have a problem with this--which they clearly seem to have--then we are all facing a major problem five or ten years down the road as Russia regains its strength. The Administration's rationale for delaying "", 'NATO ', ""enlargement has been twofold. One is the claim that it will be easier to achieve such enlargement if we go about it gradually. But the nationalist turn in Russian politics, expected to be given new impetus by the December elections for the Duma, tells us that it will not get any easier. Russia is only getting stronger and more assertive; every month, the risks and inhibitions on our side will only grow. The Administration's second rationale (at least, so I suspect) is what philosophy majors will remember as Zeno's Paradox: the idea that if you divide a distance into an infinite number of tiny increments, you never get to the destination. This may be the Administration's real calculation. In other words, it just doesn't want to enlarge "", 'NATO-', '-for fear of antagonizing Moscow. The first rationale is bad judgment; the second is bad faith. Whatever the short-term plaudits due to the Administration for putting the Bosnia conflict on ice, in Central Europe we are seeing a strategic blunder of historic proportions. ', 'Mr. GANSKE.', ' Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time for a moment, I think the gentleman has pointed out, as I did in my initial statement, that possibly the worst thing that could happen from our getting more involved is that we now have increased the proximity to some significant interactions with the Russians. The United States troops will be positions in this area right here, very close to the Russian troops that will be in this area. Mrs. Chenoweth and I will be looking at this area this weekend. But, remember, General Clark informed us in a briefing that approximately one-third of ', 'NATO ', 'forces will be tied up in this endeavor. Now, there is a great deal of unrest in Russia. What happens if later this year there is a significant turnover in power and then we have a problem not in the Balkans, but in the Baltics, and we have this type of commitment? I mean, it is a matter of weighing some real significant options. Mr. Speaker, with that, I would yield to the gentlewoman from Idaho [Mrs. Chenoweth]. ', 'Mrs. CHENOWETH.', "" Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting as we stop and think about the tests that we have been talking about, that the President, as Commander in Chief, simply has not passed. And one of those major tests is what I call the mother's test. I guess my major claim to fame is the fact that I am a mother. I am a mother of a military man who would respond to the command of his Commander in Chief, because that is the way he has been raised. But my heart breaks to think of mothers across this Nation having to let their sons and daughters go because of a President who does not understand what his role is and the role of the military, his responsibility as Commander in Chief; because, since the beginning of civilization, mothers have been willing to send their sons off to war to protect the interests of the country or the tribe or the community, to preserve the peace and tranquility of their existence, to make sure that freedom and liberty will reign for their future generation. That silent mother's test. But he has failed the mother's test. He has even failed the test of his own Secretary of State, who back in 1992 stated that we will commit troops only upon the following four criteria: No 1, [["", 'Page H ', '14235]] is he said if the mission is clearly defined; No. 2, would be if the people in this country are behind the mission; No. 3, is if there was a very clear and reasonable chance for success; and No. 4 is if there is a good, strong exit strategy. All four of those the President fails on. And probably, Mr. ', 'Speaker, I ', 'would say to the gentleman, the biggest failure is what will this do to the spirit of the military? The spirit of the military has been captured by a speech given by General ', 'MacArthur. I ', ""would like to quote just a paragraph from a great general who really understood warfare, understood how necessary it was for the general to take responsibility for his troops in the field. On May 12, 1962, in his speech, ``Duty, Honor, and Country,'' General MacArthur said, ``And through all of this,'' he said this to the graduates at West Point, he said: And through all of this welter of change and development that you will face, your mission remains fixed, determined, and it is to win our wars. Everything else in your professional career is but a corollary to this vital dedication. All other public purposes, all other public projects, all other public needs, great or small, will find others for their accomplishment, but profession of arms, the will to win, the sure knowledge that in war there is no substitute for victory, and that if you lose, the Nation will be destroyed. What are we setting our troops up for? Are we disspiriting our troops? Are we putting ourselves on a slippery slope, like we did in Vietnam, where we never have recovered economically, like the post- Vietnam wars? And the spirit of America took a hit that we were not even able to begin to recover until we had a President like Ronald Reagan who could really again show us how we could go in and win with the likes of Colin Powell and Dick Cheney. "", 'Mr. GANSKE.', ' I thank the gentlewoman, and I am sure your phone calls have been the same as mine: overwhelmingly against this. The public does not understand the reason that we should be there, and my phone calls are 8 or 9 to 1 against this. Time and time again, people are phoning saying, do not do this. We do not understand. We think you will not accomplish anything of significance. Mr. ', 'Speaker, I ', 'yield to the gentleman from California. ', 'Mr. HORN.', ' Well, Mr. ', 'Speaker, I ', 'would say to the gentleman, we have exactly the same experience, and I know a lot of our Democratic friends had that experience. The other day one representative, when asked how many letters do you get on this subject and what are they saying, she said all of them are against, 100 percent; not even one or two out of 100 supporting it. ', 'And I ', 'think the wisdom of the people in this case is right on the mark. People are not stupid. They know where our national interests ought to lie. No one has convinced us that American lives are at stake, even though Bosnia is one of the most tragic situations in the world. So was Cambodia, so were a number of places, so are those places right now in Asia and the Mideast and Africa. But we cannot be, as I said earlier today, super cop to the world, and that is sort of what we are getting ourselves into. ', 'Mr. GANSKE.', ' Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield for a minute, there is an option. The option is something that Senator Dole, for instance, recommended a couple of years ago, and that was make for a level playing field. Lift the arms embargo. Allow the various factions to have a level playing field and to settle their own civil war with the same type of support that we have done in the past, logistical and air, and yet not interpose ourselves into the middle of essentially a civil war. ', 'Mr. HORN.', "" Mr. Speaker, one of our most successful operations, as the gentleman knows, happened under the Carter administration. It is ironic that many of the advisers of President Carter also are advising this administration. But what they did that was successful, they began the effort to provide arms to the Afghan Mujaheddin, and through Pakistan they did just that as really a covert operation without using American troops, and they were able to have sufficient arms go in that the world's second strongest superpower was driven out of Afghanistan where it never should have been in the first place. "", 'Mr. GANSKE.', ' Mr. Speaker, let me summarize, and I thank my colleagues for joining me in this colloquy. I believe that this mission is primarily going to involve a breathing space for the warring parties. They need to rearm. They will do that on a brief enforced peace. I think at the end of the day it is not that America cannot tolerate casualties; it is that Americans just do not tolerate casualties unless they can see a real purpose. ']"
58,"AMERICAN TROOPS IN BOSNIA Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the debate over whether the United States should contribute its troops to a NATO peacekeeping force in Bosnia will be the focus of many speeches on this floor in the coming days. It is a subject all of us have anticipated and pondered and wrestled with for some months now, and it is one of those decisions that no one likes to make. It is fraught with uncertainties and the undeniable likelihood that Americans will be injured or killed. There will be many chances to speak on this, but having thought about it for some time and discussed it with the President and Secretary of Defense and others over the past weeks, and after listening to the President's speech last night and the responses of some of those who oppose sending troops, I want to say a few words as the debate begins. Mr. President, even before the peace agreement was signed at Dayton, the House of Representatives passed legislation to prevent the President from deploying U.S. troops to enforce a peace agreement without the consent of Congress. I believe the President should seek the approval of Congress before sending troops to Bosnia, although I do not believe the Constitution requires it in this instance where the parties have signed a peace agreement. I felt it was both unhelpful and unnecessary for the House to pass legislation in the midst of the negotiations and before a peace agreement was signed. But just as President Bush sought congressional approval for sending U.S. troops to the Persian Gulf--although half a million were there before approval was given--President Clinton has sought congressional approval, and there will be ample time to debate it before the formal signing of the agreement. The decision to send Americans into harms way is the most difficult and dangerous that any President has to make. It should be done only when a compelling national interest is at stake, and when there is no other alternative. Like many or perhaps even most Senators, the majority of my constituents, at least of those Vermonters who have contacted me, do not believe that it is in our national interest to send Americans to Bosnia. They genuinely fear another costly, drawn out quagmire like Vietnam. Some of them fought in that war, or had family members who died there. Others fear a debacle like Somalia, where in a matter of days a well-intentioned humanitarian mission became a poorly thought- out, ill-prepared peacemaking mission that ended in tragedy. It is the President's job to convince the American people that Bosnia is not Vietnam, it is not Somalia, and that our national interests compel us to take part. He made a good start last night. There are still important questions that need answers--the President said as much himself--but I am convinced that the case for sending Americans to Bosnia can be made, and I intend to help the President make it. Mr. President, in the past 4 years, a quarter of a million people, the vast majority defenseless civilians, have lost their lives in the former Yugoslavia. We have all read the blood curdling reports of hundreds and even thousands of people being rounded up at gunpoint and systematically executed or even buried alive. Countless others have had their throats cut after being horribly tortured. Some have been made to eat the flesh and drink the blood of their countrymen. Thousands of women have been raped. Men have been forced to watch their wives and daughters raped and killed before their eyes. All simply because of their ethnicity, or because they lived on land others wanted for themselves. The war has produced 2 million refugees, victims of ethnic cleansing. Hundreds of thousands more have lived in squalor for years in the rubble of what remains of their homes, without electricity, heat, or running water. There are many, including myself, who believe that NATO should have acted much earlier and with far greater force to stop the genocide in Bosnia. I opposed the use of American ground troops to try to win the war, but we gave too much deference to those who said that airpower would never compel the Serbs to negotiate peace. NATO should have been given the authority to use unrelenting force when U.N. resolutions were violated time and again with impunity. Our greatest collective failure was to put the United Nations in charge of a peacekeeping mission where there was no peace to keep, and when it was unwilling or unable to back up its own threats. These failures, which caused grievous damage to NATO's credibility, will haunt us for years to come. But the situation has changed dramatically since then. Sustained NATO bombing, coupled with gains by the Moslem and Croat forces on the battlefield, have shown the Serbs that they cannot win what they set out to achieve. The exhaustion of the warring factions, coupled with a period of extraordinarily forceful American diplomacy, has created an unprecedented opportunity to end one of the most brutal wars the world has seen in half a century. There should be no mistake. The credibility of the U.S. Government is deeply invested in the success of the peace agreement, and success of the agreement depends absolutely on NATO's enforcement of it. The parties signed with that understanding. At the same time, NATO's own credibility and effectiveness depend on U.S. leadership. Indeed, without U.S. participation, there will be no NATO force, and the peace agreement will almost certainly collapse. Mr. President, since the breakup of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war, NATO's future has been uncertain. Some have suggested that NATO has outlived its usefulness. Others say that since the rationale for NATO--deterring a Soviet invasion of Europe--is gone, NATO should become a political alliance. Still others want to quickly expand NATO to include all or most of Eastern Europe, and perhaps even some of the former Soviet republics. I mention this because NATO's future is one of the most compelling reasons why it is essential for the United States to participate in a NATO peacekeeping force in Bosnia. I have been among the strongest supporters of assistance to Russia and the other former Soviet States. A democratic Russia is obviously a major foreign policy priority for the United States. Despite many setbacks, there has been remarkable progress in Russia, Ukraine, and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union. But who can predict the next decade? Who can say that the fervent nationalism that remains strong there will not increase to a point when it becomes threatening? It is simply too soon to say what lies beyond this transitional period. [[Page S 17545]] I have been reluctant to support the rapid expansion of NATO without a thorough discussion of the implications, for fear that it could fuel the very nationalism in Russia that we seek to discourage. But neither am I among those who see no role for NATO today. On the contrary, the United States has an enormous stake in preserving NATO's strength. While NATO's focus will undoubtedly shift over time, the future holds too many uncertainties, and there are too many areas of potential conflict around the world where important interests of the United States and our allies are at stake, to allow NATO's strength to erode. There is no other alliance that comes close to NATO, in power, in readiness, and in importance to the United States. NATO may not have sought the role of peacekeeper in Bosnia, but neither can it avoid it. Mr. President, I cannot say whether this peace agreement will survive the test of time. Perhaps no one can. There is ample reason to be pessimistic, given the history of broken promises and ethnic hatred in the former Yugoslavia. Since the agreement was signed, it has become clear that no party is completely satisfied, and some have expressed grave misgivings with some aspects of it. If the agreement unravels, NATO forces may be forced to withdraw, rather than be drawn into the fighting. Even withdrawal would be risky. But virtually everyone knowledgeable about the situation there agrees that this is by far the best chance for peace since the war began 4 years ago. We and our European allies have an immense interest in preventing the continuation of a destabilizing war in Europe, and I believe we must take this chance. The President has taken a courageous step, a step that reflects the best of this country. Every American should consider the alternative. More mass murder. More towns shelled and burned. More starving children. More orphans. More horrifying atrocities that are reminiscent of the dark ages. If this does not compel us to help enforce an agreement we brokered to end this calamity, what further amount of inhuman brutality would it take? Should we wait for the slaughter of another 100,000, or 200,000? The President is right. We have a moral responsibility to take part. The Europeans were unable to end the war themselves. United States leadership was not the only factor, but without it there would be no peace agreement, and the war would go on indefinitely. We should be proud of it, and stand behind it. Some have suggested that we can lead without sending troops. I disagree. We cannot maintain our credibility as the leader of NATO if we are not prepared to assume some of the risk. We should remember that two-thirds of the NATO force will be troops from our NATO allies and others. Mr. President, our troops are the best trained in the world, but we cannot eliminate the risks. There are 2 million landmines in Bosnia alone, hidden under mud and snow. Each one cost only a few dollars, but one false step could mean the loss of any American soldier's legs or life. The Pentagon says that landmines are among the most serious threats our troops will face there. This is ironic, since the Pentagon has been actively lobbying against my efforts to show leadership by halting the use of antipersonnel landmines, which claim hundreds of innocent lives each week. Two-thirds of the Senate voted for it, but the Pentagon refuses. In the past few months, several of our European allies have stopped their use and production of these indiscriminate weapons, but the Pentagon refuses. A quarter of the Americans killed in the Persian Gulf died from landmines. A quarter of American casualties in Vietnam were from mines. I can only wonder how many more Americans will needlessly lose their legs or their lives from landmines before the Pentagon gets the message. We cannot eliminate the risks, but President Clinton has established the right conditions before US troops can be deployed. If the mission is limited in time, clear in scope, and achievable, as the President has insisted, we should support it. Our troops must be backed by broad rules of engagement that enable them to defend themselves with whatever amount of preemptive force is needed in any circumstance. That does not mean waiting to shoot until they are shot at. Mr. President, I expect to speak again as the debate on this unfolds. I intend to support the President, and I expect there will be Senators I deeply respect who are on the other side. But at the end of the day, if Americans are sent to Bosnia as I believe they will be, I have no doubt that we all will support them, and we will all be proud of them. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, since the breakup of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war, ', ""NATO'"", 's future has been uncertain. Some have suggested that ', 'NATO ', 'has outlived its usefulness. Others say that since the rationale for ', 'NATO-', '-deterring a Soviet invasion of Europe--is gone, ', 'NATO ', 'should become a political alliance. Still others want to quickly expand ', 'NATO ', 'to include all or most of Eastern Europe, and perhaps even some of the former Soviet republics. I mention this because ', ""NATO'"", 's future is one of the most compelling reasons why it is essential for the United States to participate in a ', 'NATO ', 'peacekeeping force in ', 'Bosnia. I ', 'have been among the strongest supporters of assistance to Russia and the other former Soviet ', 'States. A ', 'democratic Russia is obviously a major foreign policy priority for the United States. Despite many setbacks, there has been remarkable progress in Russia, Ukraine, and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union. But who can predict the next decade? Who can say that the fervent nationalism that remains strong there will not increase to a point when it becomes threatening? It is simply too soon to say what lies beyond this transitional period. [[', 'Page S ', '17545]] I have been reluctant to support the rapid expansion of ', 'NATO ', 'without a thorough discussion of the implications, for fear that it could fuel the very nationalism in Russia that we seek to discourage. But neither am I among those who see no role for ', 'NATO ', 'today. On the contrary, the United States has an enormous stake in preserving ', ""NATO'"", 's strength. ', ""While NATO'"", 's focus will undoubtedly shift over time, the future holds too many uncertainties, and there are too many areas of potential conflict around the world where important interests of the United States and our allies are at stake, to allow ', ""NATO'"", 's strength to erode. There is no other alliance that comes close to ', 'NATO,', ' in power, in readiness, and in importance to the United ', 'States. NATO ', 'may not have sought the role of peacekeeper in Bosnia, but neither can it avoid it. Mr. ', 'President, I ', 'cannot say whether this peace agreement will survive the test of time. Perhaps no one can. There is ample reason to be pessimistic, given the history of broken promises and ethnic hatred in the former Yugoslavia. Since the agreement was signed, it has become clear that no party is completely satisfied, and some have expressed grave misgivings with some aspects of it. If the agreement unravels, ', 'NATO ', 'forces may be forced to withdraw, rather than be drawn into the fighting. Even withdrawal would be risky. But virtually everyone knowledgeable about the situation there agrees that this is by far the best chance for peace since the war began 4 years ago. We and our European allies have an immense interest in preventing the continuation of a destabilizing war in Europe, and I believe we must take this chance. The President has taken a courageous step, a step that reflects the best of this country. Every American should consider the alternative. More mass murder. More towns shelled and burned. More starving children. More orphans. More horrifying atrocities that are reminiscent of the dark ages. If this does not compel us to help enforce an agreement we brokered to end this calamity, what further amount of inhuman brutality would it take? Should we wait for the slaughter of another 100,000, or 200,000? The President is right. We have a moral responsibility to take part. The Europeans were unable to end the war themselves. United States leadership was not the only factor, but without it there would be no peace agreement, and the war would go on indefinitely. We should be proud of it, and stand behind it. Some have suggested that we can lead without sending troops. I disagree. We cannot maintain our credibility as the leader of ', 'NATO ', 'if we are not prepared to assume some of the risk. We should remember that two-thirds of the ', 'NATO ', 'force will be troops from our ', 'NATO ', ""allies and others. Mr. President, our troops are the best trained in the world, but we cannot eliminate the risks. There are 2 million landmines in Bosnia alone, hidden under mud and snow. Each one cost only a few dollars, but one false step could mean the loss of any American soldier's legs or life. The Pentagon says that landmines are among the most serious threats our troops will face there. This is ironic, since the Pentagon has been actively lobbying against my efforts to show leadership by halting the use of antipersonnel landmines, which claim hundreds of innocent lives each week. Two-thirds of the Senate voted for it, but the Pentagon refuses. In the past few months, several of our European allies have stopped their use and production of these indiscriminate weapons, but the Pentagon refuses. A quarter of the Americans killed in the Persian Gulf died from landmines. A quarter of American casualties in Vietnam were from mines. I can only wonder how many more Americans will needlessly lose their legs or their lives from landmines before the Pentagon gets the message. We cannot eliminate the risks, but President Clinton has established the right conditions before US troops can be deployed. If the mission is limited in time, clear in scope, and achievable, as the President has insisted, we should support it. Our troops must be backed by broad rules of engagement that enable them to defend themselves with whatever amount of preemptive force is needed in any circumstance. That does not mean waiting to shoot until they are shot at. Mr. "", 'President, I ', 'expect to speak again as the debate on this unfolds. I intend to support the President, and I expect there will be ', 'Senators I ', 'deeply respect who are on the other side. But at the end of the day, if Americans are sent to Bosnia as I believe they will be, I have no doubt that we all will support them, and we will all be proud of them.

59,"CONSULTING CONGRESS Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, yesterday, together with some of my colleagues, I sent a letter to President Clinton urging him to consult with the Congress on the nature of the commitments his administration has made to our NATO allies and the Bosnians with respect to United States involvement in a potential peace enforcement operation in Bosnia. The letter included a number of specific questions about such an operation and the wisdom of the administration's present approach. Much to my surprise, administration spokesmen protested this letter claiming that there have been numerous consultations on this matter. Despite White House claims, the fact is that the Clinton administration has not consulted the Congress on sending United States ground forces to Bosnia since 1993--when consultations were held on possible enforcement of the Vance-Owen plan. What was Congress' reaction then? As part of the fiscal year 1994 Defense Appropriations bill we passed an amendment, 99 to 1. The Mitchell-Dole amendment--which reads as follows, and I quote: It is the sense of the Congress that none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this act should be available for the purposes of deploying United States Armed Forces to participate in the implementation of a peace settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina, unless previously authorized by the Congress. A subsequent provision addressed consultation on U.S. participation in any peacekeeping or peace-enforcement operations and opposed it unless, and I quote: The President initiates consultations with the bipartisan leadership of Congress... This was followed by directions for such consultation, including discussion of the goals of the operation, U.S. interests, the costs, funding strategy, extent of U.S. involvement, and the expected duration and scope of the operation. Well, it is more than 2 years later--more than 2 years later--and a great deal has changed. The situation on the ground is not what it was and the peace settlement being negotiated is also not what it was. While we are aware that the administration continues to repeat its commitment to send U.S. troops to participate in a settlement force, we in the Congress do not know what that means in concrete terms. And we believe we have a right to know. About 2\1/2\ weeks ago, the administration sent a high level team, led by Deputy Secretary of Defense White, to brief Senators on the NATO air campaign. At that time, questions were raised about administration plans to participate in a peace enforcement operation. Unfortunately, these officials did not answer any of these questions, claiming that the planning process was not finished. Mr. President, the point of consultations is to have input before there is a finished plan, before the Congress is handed a fait accompli. We do not want to be told after the fact that is a briefing, not a consultation. And we have had plenty of those where we are informed. We are not consulted; we are told. Lists of administration briefings and returned phone calls don't add up to consultation. Today administration officials and members of the contact group concluded a second round of negotiations with the Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian Foreign Ministers on principles for a peace settlement. There is little doubt in my mind that whether the Bosnian Government continues participating in these talks and finally agrees to sign a settlement will depend significantly on whether or not the United States sends troops to enforce it. Let us face it, the so-called agreed principles are vague, except in that they partition Bosnia into two entities. As such, the Bosnians are bound to rely on United States guarantees where there are differences with the Serbs, which are inevitable on matters of Bosnia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Because the administration and allied approach has left the Bosnians without the means to secure their own peace, they will depend on those troops sent to enforce a settlement to defend their sovereignty. Mr. President, we are still waiting to hear the administration's plan on lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia, a question that remains relevant now, as well as central to any exit strategy for American forces. I cannot conceive of supporting a plan that sends United States troops into Bosnia, while leaving the Bosnians unable to defend against future aggression. We must know what the administration is telling the Bosnians, the Serbs, and our NATO allies, what promises and what threats, are being made. We also need to know what commitments are being made to the Russians with respect to their participation. In particular what is the administration response to Russian demands to share command with NATO in an enforcement operation? Will U.S. forces be under unified NATO command at all times? The bottom line is that U.S. credibility depends on the United States keeping its word, meaning what it says. NATO credibility is also on the line. Why has there been no response to Bosnian Serb violations of the NATO no-fly zone reported today and last week? No doubt about it, there is a lot at stake here--United States and NATO credibility, as well as the future of Bosnia. [[Page S 14272]] It cannot escape the administration that the Congress has repudiated its approach toward Bosnia for the past 2 years. An overwhelming bipartisan majority has opposed the arms embargo, and Congress has voiced concerns with respect to peace plans that would destroy the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. So, to operate under the assumption that Congress will approve administration plans to send thousands of Americans in harm's way to enforce a settlement is a major error. The fact is that the Clinton administration may be making promises it cannot or should not keep. Therefore, I am writing today to the chairmen of the Appropriations, Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees to request that they hold extensive hearings on this critical issue. I will request that the questions asked in the letter to President Clinton form the basis of their examination of this matter. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter we sent to the President today be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. Senate, Office of the Republican Leader, Washington, DC, September 25, 1995. The President, The White House, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. President: It is our understanding that your administration, together with our NATO allies, is completing plans to enforce a potential settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina--a settlement not yet finalized. Much to our dismay, what we have learned about possible U.S. troop obligations has been largely from press reports. To date, your administration has failed to consult with the Congress on the nature and extent of commitments made to our NATO allies and the Bosnian government regarding U.S. participation in a force to implement a settlement. We are especially concerned since those forces must consist primarily of ground troops. There should be no doubts that without the concurrence of the Congress these commitments will not be fulfilled. In our view, your administration must answer the following questions as soon as possible in order that the Senate may begin to fulfill its responsibility to carefully evaluate this matter: (1) What specific commitments regarding U.S. troop participation have been made by your administration to our NATO allies? (2) What specific commitments regarding U.S. troop participation have been made by your administration to the Bosnian government? (3) What is the range of total NATO ground force levels, related to enforcement of a Bosnian peace settlement, being considered in the administration and at NATO headquarters? What would the U.S. contribution of forces be? What is the estimate of the number of reservists that would need to be called up? What is the estimated impact of such a deployment on readiness? (4) Would this be a NATO-only operation or would Russian troops and/or other troops, from Islamic countries for example, also be a part of that total force enforcing a settlement? (5) Would NATO be in complete command of all forces involved in an enforcement operation? Or would Russian forces an non-NATO forces be under different command arrangements? If so, how would these varied command arrangements be ultimately integrated in order to achieve unity of command? Is there to be another dual- key command? (6) When would NATO forces be deployed--immediately after an agreement is signed or after Bosnian government and Bosnian Serb forces withdraw to lines of demarcation? What if the fighting does not stop after an agreement is signed? (7) Is there a time table for UNPROFOR withdrawal? Would some of these U.N. units, from NATO contributing countries, remain as part of the new force? (8) When would the ``dual key'' be eliminated? Would there be any other U.N. input into the command arrangements? (9) What would the rules of engagement for NATO forces be? (10) Where would NATO troops be deployed? In Bosnian Serb controlled territory? (11) Would Bosnian government forces be supplied with additional arms during this enforcement period so that Bosnia can better defend itself against aggression after NATO forces leave? If so, what types of weapons would be provided and by whom? Has a commitment to provide military assistance--to include arms and/or training--to the Bosnian government in a post-settlement period been made by Assistant Secretary Holbrooke, or any other administration officials to Bosnian government officials? (12) How long would NATO troops be deployed? What is the exit strategy? (13) What are the estimated costs of such a NATO deployment? What would the U.S. share be and how does the administration plan to pay for it? Mr. President, these are not the only questions that will need to be answered, but they are essential to any Congressional debate and consideration of commitments made by you and your administration with respect to U.S. troops participating in an enforcement operation. Thre are also matters of principle that will have to be carefully considered. First and foremost is a very fundamental question--whether United States forces should be deployed to partition a sovereign and independent country into two entities. Our men and women in the military have protected our freedom and our interests and defended our principles. Do we want to place our soldiers in harms' way to defend the compromise of our principles? We must also ask whether or not any settlement reached has been agreed to freely by the Bosnian government and without coercion. We are concerned about news reports that senior administration officials gained Bosnian government agreement on the first set of ``Agreed Principles'' by threatening a halt in NATO bombing. Finally, we must ask whether it would not be more just and more wise to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina, and allow the Bosnians to fight until there is a stable military balance--the precondition for any settlement which would not require the deployment of thousands of American and NATO troops to police it. Mr. President, we have serious concerns about the commitments you and your administration reportedly have made with respect to U.S. participation--to include thousands of ground forces--in enforcing a possible Bosnian peace settlement. We hope that you will begin to consult earnestly and forthrightly with the Congress in the very near future. Sincerely, Robert Dole, John W. Warner, Thad Cochran, Bob Smith, Jesse Helms, Arlen Specter, James M. Inhofe, Dirk Kempthorne, Jon Kyl, Kay Bailey Hutchison. Mr. DOLE. I reserve the balance of my leader's time.

Mr. President, these are not the only questions that will need to be answered, but they are essential to any Congressional debate and consideration of commitments made by you and your administration with respect to U.S. troops participating in an enforcement operation. Thre are also matters of principle that will have to be carefully considered. First and foremost is a very fundamental question--whether United States forces should be deployed to partition a sovereign and independent country into two entities. Our men and women in the military have protected our freedom and our interests and defended our principles. Do we want to place our soldiers in harms' way to defend the compromise of our principles? We must also ask whether or not any settlement reached has been agreed to freely by the Bosnian government and without coercion. We are concerned about news reports that senior administration officials gained Bosnian government agreement on the first set of ``Agreed Principles'' by threatening a halt in "", 'NATO ', 'bombing. Finally, we must ask whether it would not be more just and more wise to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina, and allow the Bosnians to fight until there is a stable military balance--the precondition for any settlement which would not require the deployment of thousands of American and ', 'NATO ', 'troops to police it. Mr. President, we have serious concerns about the commitments you and your administration reportedly have made with respect to U.S. participation--to include thousands of ground forces--in enforcing a possible Bosnian peace settlement. We hope that you will begin to consult earnestly and forthrightly with the Congress in the very near future.

60,"BOSNIA Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, following whatever disposition of regulatory reform, we will take up the resolution on Bosnia. We were visited today by Secretary of State Christopher and General Shalikashvili, and they made their pitch about how bad the Dole-Lieberman resolution would be on Bosnia, as far as lifting the arms embargo. Somebody asked the question, if it is so bad, what is so good about what is happening in Bosnia now? Obviously, we did not have an answer. There is not any answer. Today I received from Lady Margaret Thatcher a letter which I think is probably the best summation I have read about Bosnia and the tragedy there. I placed a copy on everyone's desk, but I will read it for the record. The letter is as follows: July 18, 1995 Dear Senator Dole: I am writing to express my very strong support for your attempt to have the arms embargo against Bosnia lifted. I know that you and all members of the United States Senate share my horror at the crimes against humanity now being perpetrated by the Serbs in Bosnia. The UN and NATO have failed to enforce the Security Council Resolutions which authorized the use of force to defend the safe havens and to get humanitarian assistance through. The safe havens were never safe; now they are falling to Serb assault. Murder, ethnic cleansing, mass rape and torture are the legacy of the policy of the last three years to the people of Bosnia. It has failed utterly. We owe it to the victims at last and at least to have the weapons to defend themselves--since we ourselves are not willing to defend them. The arms embargo was always morally wrong. Significantly, it was imposed on the (then formally intact but fragmenting) former Yugoslavia at that regime's own behest. It was then, quite unjustly and possibly illegally, applied to the successor states. Its effect--and, as regards the Surbs, its intention--was to ensure that the proponents of a Greater Serbia, who inherited the great bulk of the Yugoslav army's equipment, enjoyed overwhelming military superiority in their aggression. It is worth recalling that the democratically elected, multi-faith and multi-ethnic Bosnian Government never asked for a single UN soldier to be sent. It did ask for the arms required to defend its own people against a ruthless aggressor. That request was repeatedly denied, in spite of the wishes of the US administration and of most leading American politicians. There is no point now in listing the failures of military policy which subsequently occurred. Suffice it to say that, instead of succeeding in enforcing the mandates the UN Security Council gave them, UNPROFOR became potential and then actual hostages. Airpower was never seriously employed either. The oft repeated arguments against lifting the arms embargo--that if it occurred UN troops would be at risk, that the enclaves like Srebrenica would fall, that the Serbs would abandon all restraint--have all now been proved worthless. For all these things have happened and the arms embargo still applies. Two arguments are, however, still advanced by those who wish to keep the arms embargo in place. Each is demonstrably false. First, it is said that lifting the arms embargo would prolong the war in Bosnia. This is, of course, a morally repulsive argument, for it implies that all we should care about it a quick end to the conflict without regard to the justice or otherwise of its outcome. But in any case it is based on the false assumption that the Serbs are bound to win. Over the last year the Bosnian army has grown much stronger and the Bosnian Serbs weaker. The Bosnian army has, with its Croat allies, been winning back crucial territory, while desertion and poor morale are badly affecting the over- extended Serb forces. What the Bosnian government lacks however are the tanks and artillery needed to hold the territory won and force the Serbs to negotiate. This lack of equipment is directly the result of the arms embargo. Because of it the war is being prolonged and the casualties are higher. Lifting the arms embargo would thus shorten not lengthen the war. Second, it is said that lifting the arms embargo would lead to rifts within the UN Security Council and NATO. But are there not rifts already? And are these themselves not the result of pursuing a failed policy involving large risks to outside countries ground troops, rather than arming and training the victims to repel the aggressor? American leadership is vital to bring order out of the present chaos. No country must be allowed to veto the action required to end the present catastrophe. And if American leadership is truly evident along the lines of the policy which you and your colleagues are advancing I do not believe that any country will actually try to obstruct it. The West has already waited too long. Time is now terribly short. All those who care about peace and justice for the tragic victims of aggression in the former Yugoslavia now have their eyes fixed on the actions of the US Senate. I hope, trust and pray that your initiative to have the arms embargo against Bosnia lifted succeeds. It will bring new hope to those who are suffering so much. With warm regards, Yours Sincerely, Margaret Thatcher. Mr. President, having read the letter, I think it says it all. I know the administration has said we will finally have a policy. It will not be business as usual. After 30 months, we will do something. No one is talking about committing American ground troops. In fact, just the opposite. Lifting the arms embargo keeps America out of any engagement. It seems to me that is something that should have been done a long time ago. We have waited almost a year. A year ago August we had our last vote on this important issue. Mr. President, 58 out of 100 Senators voted to lift the embargo--Democrats and Republicans, bipartisan. This is not an initiative by Senator Dole or Senator Lieberman, though we are working together. This is an initiative of the U.S. Senate, in a bipartisan way, to address a very serious problem. The President has made two promises. One, to commit 25,000 American forces, if, in fact, there is a peace settlement, to keep the peace. More recently, commit 25,000 Americans to extricate members of the U.N. protection forces in case of withdrawal. I am advised by the Bosnian Foreign Minister today that only 30 U.N. protection force members are in occupied Serb territory today. And he asked the question, why would it take 25,000 Americans to extricate 30 members of the U.N. protection forces? He says very clearly that there will be no interference on the part of Muslims with any withdrawal of U.N. protection forces. [[Page S 10226]] No question about it, this matter is very, very important. It is very serious, as Secretary of State Christopher told Members today at noon. It has been serious if you are the ones doing the dying--or even the killing. But one side has done nearly all the dying, and one side has done nearly all the killing. Those doing the dying do not have tanks or heavy weapons or artillery to defend themselves. They have rifles. In many cases they surrendered their heavy weapons because they were told they would be safe in these safe havens. So they surrendered their heavy weapons, their only means to defend themselves, and notified, in the case of Zepa, Medjedja, Gorazde, that the safe havens--that Lady Thatcher points out in the letter were never safe--and now they are falling to Serb assault. This debate will begin, if not today, hopefully tomorrow. I hope we will have broad bipartisan support, unanimous support. I know the Secretary of State told Members at the Democratic policy lunch today that timing is everything, ``This is a terrible time to bring up this resolution.'' We have been told that at every turn. It is always a bad time. We thought, ourselves, it was a bad time to bring up the resolution, when you had U.N. Protection Forces chained to poles and held as hostages so there would be no more air strikes, and used as human shields. So we deferred consideration of the resolution. And we have waited and waited and waited, hoping something good might happen. But nothing good has happened. Again, the Foreign Minister of Bosnia, who will be here, I guess, for several days, and has met with a number of Senators in both parties, indicates clearly that the U.N. Protection Forces should go. So I hope in the next 24 hours we will be able to move to the resolution. I hope my colleagues on this side will listen carefully to many on this side who are cosponsoring this resolution, and colleagues on the other side will listen carefully to Senator Lieberman and others who will be leading the effort. The point I wish to make is this is not a partisan effort. It is not an effort aimed at President Clinton. I complained--or criticized the Bosnian policy during the Bush administration. So it is not something that we have discovered because we now have a Democrat in the White House. So for 30 months, many of us originally supported Candidate Clinton, who said we ought to lift the arms embargo and have air strikes. We supported him. I remember meeting in the White House in 1993, in the spring, and we were talking about lifting the arms embargo. Most of us there supported the President's desire at that time to lift the arms embargo. Then, for some reason--it has never been fully understood by this Senator--it just sort of went off the radar screen. Bosnia was forgotten. It is as though the President never said anything about Bosnia, never said anything about lifting the arms embargo. Then we were told a year ago, in April, if we would just wait--and there was a resolution offered by the then Democratic leader, Senator Mitchell, and Senator Nunn, that they would go to the United Nations and make a plea that the British and the French also lift the arms embargo. That was one way to stall any action on the other resolution. The trouble is, they had never gone to the United Nations and asked for that, asked that the embargo be lifted. So we are back. We believe it is critical. We believe it is crucial. If anybody has any doubts, watch the television tonight, read the paper in the morning. Again, to make it very clear to some who always feel it is going to Americanize the war, we have already Americanized the war. Scott O'Grady is an American, last time I checked. And he was shot down because we had not been notified that there were SAM sites in the area. So American pilots are part of NATO. Lifting the arms embargo, removing the U.N. Protection Forces--and I commend the bravery and courage of all those who are engaged in the U.N. Protection Forces. But the problem is, they cannot protect themselves and they cannot protect the safe havens and they act as a buffer for the aggressors, the Serbs. Whether they intend it or not, they have been, in effect, an ally of the aggressors. And many of us do not believe that was ever intended. Again, let me make a distinction between the Serb people and Milosevic and Karadzic and some of the others who are dedicated to ethnic cleansing, murder, butchery--whatever it takes to eliminate Bosnian Moslems. I know the Serb people are just as tired of the fighting, and the mothers are just as tired of sending their sons to face possible death, as anybody on the other side. So we are going to be on the Bosnian resolution. I hope, on the matter of timing, it seems to me the best thing that could happen for this administration is for the Senate to pass with a big, big vote, our resolution. That would give the President and the Secretary of State or whomever they designate to negotiate with the British and the French and others a great deal of leverage. Because at that point they could say, ``The Senate has acted. The House has acted. It is time to go. It is time to go.'' Then we would turn the fighting over to the parties who are directly involved. Give the Bosnians a chance. They are a member of the United Nations. They are an independent nation. They have lost--70 percent of their land has been taken; 70 percent. And we are saying, ``Oh, wait. Wait. We want to wait a while.'' Will we wait until 80 percent is taken? All they want is a right they believe they are entitled to, which we believe in this country is an inherent right, the right of self defense. They would hope for the same as a nation, the right of self defense as a nation. In my view, they are entitled to that right. I think most of us agree they are entitled to that right. Take a look at the casualty figures. Who has been doing the dying? Who has been doing the killing? Who has been involved in that? I must say, in some cases it is probably hard to differentiate, because there has been a lot of treachery and tragedy on all sides. But for the most part, there is no question about who the aggressors have been. I just believe it is time for us to stand up. This is a moral issue, one that should have been addressed a long time ago. It can be addressed without committing American forces. All we need to do is say we are going to lift the arms embargo and as an independent nation you are going to have a right to defend yourself-- which does not seem to me to be a very difficult decision. We are not going to defend them. If we lift the embargo, it is not we defending them. If we lift the embargo, you defend yourself. So I hope my colleagues will be prepared for debate on this very important issue, and that we can take final action before the week is out. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

And are these themselves not the result of pursuing a failed policy involving large risks to outside countries ground troops, rather than arming and training the victims to repel the aggressor? American leadership is vital to bring order out of the present chaos. No country must be allowed to veto the action required to end the present catastrophe. And if American leadership is truly evident along the lines of the policy which you and your colleagues are advancing I do not believe that any country will actually try to obstruct it. The West has already waited too long. Time is now terribly short. All those who care about peace and justice for the tragic victims of aggression in the former Yugoslavia now have their eyes fixed on the actions of the US ', 'Senate. I ', 'hope, trust and pray that your initiative to have the arms embargo against Bosnia lifted succeeds. It will bring new hope to those who are suffering so much. With warm regards, Yours Sincerely, Margaret Thatcher. Mr. President, having read the letter, I think it says it all. I know the administration has said we will finally have a policy. It will not be business as usual. After 30 months, we will do something. No one is talking about committing American ground troops. In fact, just the opposite. Lifting the arms embargo keeps America out of any engagement. It seems to me that is something that should have been done a long time ago. We have waited almost a year. A year ago August we had our last vote on this important issue. Mr. President, 58 out of 100 Senators voted to lift the embargo--Democrats and Republicans, bipartisan. This is not an initiative by Senator Dole or Senator Lieberman, though we are working together. This is an initiative of the U.S. Senate, in a bipartisan way, to address a very serious problem. The President has made two promises. One, to commit 25,000 American forces, if, in fact, there is a peace settlement, to keep the peace. More recently, commit 25,000 Americans to extricate members of the U.N. protection forces in case of withdrawal. I am advised by the Bosnian Foreign Minister today that only 30 U.N. protection force members are in occupied Serb territory today. And he asked the question, why would it take 25,000 Americans to extricate 30 members of the U.N. protection forces? He says very clearly that there will be no interference on the part of Muslims with any withdrawal of U.N. protection forces. [[', 'Page S ', ""10226]] No question about it, this matter is very, very important. It is very serious, as Secretary of State Christopher told Members today at noon. It has been serious if you are the ones doing the dying--or even the killing. But one side has done nearly all the dying, and one side has done nearly all the killing. Those doing the dying do not have tanks or heavy weapons or artillery to defend themselves. They have rifles. In many cases they surrendered their heavy weapons because they were told they would be safe in these safe havens. So they surrendered their heavy weapons, their only means to defend themselves, and notified, in the case of Zepa, Medjedja, Gorazde, that the safe havens--that Lady Thatcher points out in the letter were never safe--and now they are falling to Serb assault. This debate will begin, if not today, hopefully tomorrow. I hope we will have broad bipartisan support, unanimous support. I know the Secretary of State told Members at the Democratic policy lunch today that timing is everything, ``This is a terrible time to bring up this resolution.'' We have been told that at every turn. It is always a bad time. We thought, ourselves, it was a bad time to bring up the resolution, when you had U.N. Protection Forces chained to poles and held as hostages so there would be no more air strikes, and used as human shields. So we deferred consideration of the resolution. And we have waited and waited and waited, hoping something good might happen. But nothing good has happened. Again, the Foreign Minister of Bosnia, who will be here, I guess, for several days, and has met with a number of Senators in both parties, indicates clearly that the U.N. Protection Forces should go. "", 'So I ', 'hope in the next 24 hours we will be able to move to the resolution. I hope my colleagues on this side will listen carefully to many on this side who are cosponsoring this resolution, and colleagues on the other side will listen carefully to Senator Lieberman and others who will be leading the effort. The point I wish to make is this is not a partisan effort. It is not an effort aimed at President ', 'Clinton. I ', ""complained--or criticized the Bosnian policy during the Bush administration. So it is not something that we have discovered because we now have a Democrat in the White House. So for 30 months, many of us originally supported Candidate Clinton, who said we ought to lift the arms embargo and have air strikes. We supported him. I remember meeting in the White House in 1993, in the spring, and we were talking about lifting the arms embargo. Most of us there supported the President's desire at that time to lift the arms embargo. Then, for some reason--it has never been fully understood by this Senator--it just sort of went off the radar screen. Bosnia was forgotten. It is as though the President never said anything about Bosnia, never said anything about lifting the arms embargo. Then we were told a year ago, in April, if we would just wait--and there was a resolution offered by the then Democratic leader, Senator Mitchell, and Senator Nunn, that they would go to the United Nations and make a plea that the British and the French also lift the arms embargo. That was one way to stall any action on the other resolution. The trouble is, they had never gone to the United Nations and asked for that, asked that the embargo be lifted. So we are back. We believe it is critical. We believe it is crucial. If anybody has any doubts, watch the television tonight, read the paper in the morning. Again, to make it very clear to some who always feel it is going to Americanize the war, we have already Americanized the war. "", ""Scott O'"", 'Grady is an American, last time I checked. And he was shot down because we had not been notified that there were SAM sites in the area. So American pilots are part of ', 'NATO.', ' Lifting the arms embargo, removing the U.N. Protection Forces--and I commend the bravery and courage of all those who are engaged in the U.N. Protection Forces. But the problem is, they cannot protect themselves and they cannot protect the safe havens and they act as a buffer for the aggressors, the Serbs. Whether they intend it or not, they have been, in effect, an ally of the aggressors. And many of us do not believe that was ever intended. Again, let me make a distinction between the Serb people and Milosevic and Karadzic and some of the others who are dedicated to ethnic cleansing, murder, butchery--whatever it takes to eliminate Bosnian ', 'Moslems. I ', ""know the Serb people are just as tired of the fighting, and the mothers are just as tired of sending their sons to face possible death, as anybody on the other side. So we are going to be on the Bosnian resolution. I hope, on the matter of timing, it seems to me the best thing that could happen for this administration is for the Senate to pass with a big, big vote, our resolution. That would give the President and the Secretary of State or whomever they designate to negotiate with the British and the French and others a great deal of leverage. Because at that point they could say, ``The Senate has acted. The House has acted. It is time to go. It is time to go.'' Then we would turn the fighting over to the parties who are directly involved. Give the Bosnians a chance. They are a member of the United Nations. They are an independent nation. They have lost--70 percent of their land has been taken; 70 percent. And we are saying, ``Oh, wait. Wait. We want to wait a while.'' Will we wait until 80 percent is taken? All they want is a right they believe they are entitled to, which we believe in this country is an inherent right, the right of self defense. They would hope for the same as a nation, the right of self defense as a nation. In my view, they are entitled to that right. I think most of us agree they are entitled to that right. Take a look at the casualty figures. Who has been doing the dying? Who has been doing the killing? Who has been involved in that? I must say, in some cases it is probably hard to differentiate, because there has been a lot of treachery and tragedy on all sides. But for the most part, there is no question about who the aggressors have been. I just believe it is time for us to stand up. This is a moral issue, one that should have been addressed a long time ago. It can be addressed without committing American forces. All we need to do is say we are going to lift the arms embargo and as an independent nation you are going to have a right to defend yourself-- which does not seem to me to be a very difficult decision. We are not going to defend them. If we lift the embargo, it is not we defending them. If we lift the embargo, you defend yourself. "", 'So I ', 'hope my colleagues will be prepared for debate on this very important issue, and that we can take final action before the week is out. Mr. ', 'President, I ', 'yield the floor. ', 'The PRESIDING ', 'OFFICER ', '(Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Wisconsin. ']"
61,"HAITI'S ELECTION Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last September, the United States sent 20,000 of its sons and daughters to Haiti. Their ostensible mission was defined in the name given to this unopposed invasion of another country--Operation Uphold Democracy. Today, we are told by some Haitian Government Ministers, by the head of Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council, and even by our own Washington Post, that democracy--a form of government that we exported to Haiti at the risk of American lives--may be, in the end, too much to expect from this poor, troubled, violent country. Few would disagree that what happened last Sunday at least raised questions, serious questions, about whether Haiti's elections were free and fair. But, as I just noted, among the few, were some Aristide ministers; Mr. Remy, the hopelessly incompetent chairman of Haiti's election council; and, again, the Washington Post. In truth, the gross irregularities that plagued last Sunday's election, and the polling that occurred on Monday purportedly to compensate for a small fraction of those irregularities, as well as the mounting evidence of vote counting fraud have made it, in the sensible judgment of Representative Porter Goss--``impossible to verify the results of this election.'' Mr. Goss led an accredited election observation team from the International Republican Institute [IRI]. I have the honor of serving the institute as chairman of its board of directors. I am proud of IRI's work generally, and its work in Haiti specifically. I will talk some more about the quality of that work a little later in my remarks. I want to first talk briefly about the elections and the gross irregularities that indeed make it impossible to verify the results. It is important to note that no observer of the election--be it OAS observers, or observers on the White House delegation, or even one very candid Government minister in Haiti, will dispute the evidence of irregularities which IRI's observers and these other monitors uncovered. IRI observers found that these elections were, in a word, chaotic. The headline for today's Washington Post story on the elections was ``Unanimity in Haiti: Elections Were Chaotic.'' Unfortunately, no one seems to have told the Washington Post's editorial writers. Or, possibly, those writers do not believe that the chaos which, in truth, defined these elections seriously undermined their integrity. If that is the judgement of the Washington Post's editors it is a faulty one, and it cannot withstand the weight of the abundant evidence that the election process--from the campaign season through election day to the ballot counting--was plagued by very grave problems. People can judge for themselves whether these problems have rendered the elections completely unfair and unfree. The IRI delegation's responsibility as impartial observers was to simply call them as they saw them. What they saw was rather discouraging, so discouraging that even Aristide's Minister for Culture, Jean-Claude Bajeux, offered an apology. ``As a member of the Government,'' he said, ``I am not proud of this.'' Minister Bajeux went on to observe that ``instead of improving on the 1990 elections, we have done worse.'' Not surprisingly, the widespread irregularities have prompted opposition parties to reject these elections as fraudulent. That charge was leveled by the mayor of Port-au-Prince, Evans Paul, as well. You will recall, Mr. President, that Mayor Paul's post support for President Aristide was often referred to by President Aristide's supporters in the United States. Mr. President, let me offer a brief sampling of the irregularities which the IRI delegation documented. I will first read from the executive summary of IRI's pre-election report which evaluated the pre- electoral process and environment for their comparison to minimal standards of acceptability. The elections were originally to be held in December, but were postponed several times for a variety of reasons. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete executive summary be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [[Page S 9142]] Executive Summary electoral process The legal foundation for these elections was a Presidential decree that subverted the legislative process. The formulation of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) itself breached an agreement between the President of the Republic and the political parties to allow the parties to nominate all candidates from which CEP members would be chosen by the three branches of government. Only two of the nine CEP members were chosen from the parties' list. The voter registration process, to have been administered by the CEP, was complicated by miscalculations of population size, lack of sufficient materials and registration sites, and one million missing voter registration cards. The CEP review of the over 11,000 candidate dossiers for eligibility was a protracted process that occurred under a cloak of secrecy. When the CEP made its decisions known, by radio, no reasons were given for the thousands of candidates rejected. After vehement protests by the parties, some reasons were supplied and supplemental lists were announced through June 14, thirty-one days after the date the final candidate list was to be announced. This stripped the CEP of its credibility with the political parties. There is still not a final list of approved candidates available. The sliding scale of registration fees imposed by the CEP-- whereby political parties with fewer CEP approved candidates pay larger fees--has made it difficult for many parties to compete. As of June 20, five days before the election, protests against this unusual requirement have gone unanswered. The ability of the CEP and those under its direction to administer an election is unclear. As of June 20, five days prior to the election, formal instructions for the procedures of election day and the count had yet to be issued; this has prevented the 45,000 persons needed to administer election day from receiving specific training. As of June 20, those persons designated by the political parties as pollwatchers had not yet received any training from the CEP which could lead to serious confusion on election day. These actions have led to deep misgivings across the Haitian political spectrum about the ability of the CEP to fulfill the mandate and functions normally executed by election commissions. Political parties had no idea to whom to turn with complaints in the process--the CEP, the President of the Republic, the United Nations Electoral Assistance Unit or the United States Government. Three political parties withdrew from the process as a form of protest. electoral environment A concern for security is an issue that has permeated every step of the process. The assassination of Mireille Durocher Bertin, a well-known lawyer and leading political opponent of Aristide, only conformed the fears of the parties and candidates. During the crisis, many elected representatives feared returning to their districts, contributing to the decay of political infrastructure. Candidates have curtailed their campaign activities and has given personal security a higher priority. The campaign itself began late and has been barely visible until some activities in the last week prior to elections. Given the process and environment surrounding these elections, it is doubtful many of Haiti's recognized political parties could have competed effectively. The electorate itself is basically uninformed about this election--what it stands for and who is running. There has been no civic education campaign, with the exception of some limited U.S. and U.N. military efforts, to illuminate the purpose of this election. Similarly, there has been no educational campaign on how to vote, which for a largely illiterate population in Haiti could pose serious difficulties on election day. Compared to other ``transition elections'' observed by IRI, such as in Russia in 1993, El Salvador in 1994, South Africa in 1994 and even China's Jilan Province village elections in 1994, the pre-electoral process and environment in Haiti has seriously challenged the most minimally accepted standards for the holding of a credible election. Mr. McCAIN. Those are the problems that undermined the integrity of the election before election day. We have all read newspaper accounts over the last 2 days which chronicled the abuses and irregularities that occurred on Sunday. Mr. Goss accurately reported in a press statement yesterday the following serious problems. While the international military served well as a deterrent to widespread violence, the elections were not free of violence and intimidation. Violent incidents closed local polling stations in Port- au-Prince, Limbe, Port de Paix, Don Don, Ferrier, Jean Rabel, Carrefour, and Cite Soleil. The election council failed to deliver and distribute voter materials to a number of polling stations. This resulted in countless delayed voting place openings and postponed the elections in some places. Unsurprisingly, these delays and postponements caused widespread voter frustration which helps explain why turnout was low. There was also widespread disregard for the secrecy of the ballot. Many voters had little choice but to mark their ballots in the open. The thoroughly arbitrary process of qualifying candidates led to serious consequences which we anticipated in our pre-election survey. The disqualification of some candidates proved to destabilize the electoral environment in certain areas, this was most acutely the case in Saint Marc and Jean Rabel. The New York Times reports that at least 200,000 voters are still waiting to cast their ballots, but election officials still won't say when and if they will be allowed to do so. Regarding the vote tally, I will quote not from IRI's report but from the Organization of American States which had a much larger observation team in Haiti. Because of administrative failings in the election it remains to be seen how effectively the count will be carried out. As anyone who read a newspaper today discovered, allegations of widespread abuse and irregularities in the counting process are coming in by the dozens. Again and again, we are hearing from all observers that unmarked ballots are being marked at the regional counting centers to indicate a vote for Lavalas candidates. Mr. President, this is, as I said, only a brief sampling of the problems which IRI observers and all credible observers witnessed. For calling the press' attention to these problems, the IRI mission was chastised today in a Washington Post editorial for unconstructive political science correctness. In response to that charge let me just quote the last two paragraphs of Mr. Goss' statement yesterday as chairman of our delegation. It was important for Haiti and the international community to hold this election, but holding an election is simply not enough. The purpose of this election was to create layers of government that can serve as checks and balances on each other and decentralize power as envisioned by the 1987 Constitution. That is why it was important to have an inclusive process, not one marked by exclusion. It has been IRI's intent throughout this process to be thorough, independent, objective and constructive. In this regard, IRI will maintain a presence in Haiti through the final round of elections and will make recommendations for the formation of the permanent electoral council. This is hardly inflammatory language, Mr. President. In fact, I think most people would consider it as well as all of IRI's reporting to be constructive, informed criticism. Indeed, Brian Atwood, Director of U.S.A.I.D. and head of the Clinton administration's observation delegation in Haiti, said about IRI's reporting: ``they have performed a service.'' The Post's editors are being a little disingenuous, I fear, when they raise the obviously bogus charge of political correctness. After all, that is not a problem that the Post usually finds distressing. What the Post is really saying, as are those hysterical critics of IRI's delegation in the Aristide Government and on the Provisional Electoral Council; What they are really saying is that Haiti should not be expected to adhere to minimally acceptable election process standards. IRI has observed elections in 48 countries. Some of those countries and some of those elections were the subject of disagreements, sometimes, but not always, partisan disagreements in the U.S. Congress. Elections in Chile, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Russia come to mind. Never, not once, has there been the slightest intimation that IRI delegations were anything other than objective, scrupulously fair, committed, hard working professionals. On the contrary, IRI delegations are routinely acclaimed for their thorough professionalism. But because IRI discovered and reported information which, apparently, the Washington Post editorial writers would have preferred to have gone unnoticed, the integrity of these observers--not the election, but the observers--is now called into question by those editorialists and others. What the Post editorial writers and others are really saying is that whatever standards we hold El Salvador to; whatever standards we hold Nicaragua to; whatever standards we hold Croatia to; whatever standards we hold Serbia [[Page S 9143]] to; whatever standards we hold Albania to; whatever standards we hold Bulgaria to; whatever standards we hold Azerbaijan to; whatever standards we hold Russia to; whatever standards to which we hold all these countries where IRI observed elections without controversy, no matter how minimal those standards are we cannot expect Haiti to meet them. Mr. President, that is what the Washington Post said today, and it is an injustice. It is an injustice to IRI; to Mr. Porter Goss and all the good and honorable people on IRI's election observation delegation in Haiti. Most importantly, Mr. President, it is an injustice to the people of Haiti. They are human beings who yearn for freedom like any other nation, and who are capable of building and sustaining the institutions that will protect that freedom. To expect any less of Haiti is, as I said, an injustice. The people who have condescended to Haitians, including the Post editorialists, by asking the world's indulgence of their election's failings, should apologize to the Haitian people, and to those good Americans who they have maligned in the process. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

What the Post editorial writers and others are really saying is that whatever standards we hold El Salvador to; whatever standards we hold Nicaragua to; whatever standards we hold Croatia to; whatever standards we hold Serbia [[Page S 9143]] to; whatever standards we hold Albania to; whatever standards we hold Bulgaria to; whatever standards we hold Azerbaijan to; whatever standards we hold Russia to; whatever standards to which we hold all these countries where IRI observed elections without controversy, no matter how minimal those standards are we cannot expect Haiti to meet them. Mr. President, that is what the Washington Post said today, and it is an injustice. It is an injustice to IRI; to Mr. Porter Goss and all the good and honorable people on IRI's election observation delegation in Haiti. Most importantly, Mr. President, it is an injustice to the people of Haiti. They are human beings who yearn for freedom like any other nation, and who are capable of building and sustaining the institutions that will protect that freedom. To expect any less of Haiti is, as I said, an injustice. The people who have condescended to Haitians, including the Post editorialists, by asking the world's indulgence of their election's failings, should apologize to the Haitian people, and to those good Americans who they have maligned in the process. Mr. President, I yield the floor. ","['Mr. ', 'McCAIN.', "" Mr. President, last September, the United States sent 20,000 of its sons and daughters to Haiti. Their ostensible mission was defined in the name given to this unopposed invasion of another country--Operation Uphold Democracy. Today, we are told by some Haitian Government Ministers, by the head of Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council, and even by our own Washington Post, that democracy--a form of government that we exported to Haiti at the risk of American lives--may be, in the end, too much to expect from this poor, troubled, violent country. Few would disagree that what happened last Sunday at least raised questions, serious questions, about whether Haiti's elections were free and fair. But, as I just noted, among the few, were some Aristide ministers; Mr. Remy, the hopelessly incompetent chairman of Haiti's election council; and, again, the Washington Post. In truth, the gross irregularities that plagued last Sunday's election, and the polling that occurred on Monday purportedly to compensate for a small fraction of those irregularities, as well as the mounting evidence of vote counting fraud have made it, in the sensible judgment of Representative Porter Goss--``impossible to verify the results of this election.'' Mr. Goss led an accredited election observation team from the International Republican Institute [IRI]. I have the honor of serving the institute as chairman of its board of directors. I am proud of IRI's work generally, and its work in Haiti specifically. I will talk some more about the quality of that work a little later in my remarks. I want to first talk briefly about the elections and the gross irregularities that indeed make it impossible to verify the results. It is important to note that no observer of the election--be it OAS observers, or observers on the White House delegation, or even one very candid Government minister in Haiti, will dispute the evidence of irregularities which IRI's observers and these other monitors uncovered. IRI observers found that these elections were, in a word, chaotic. The headline for today's Washington Post story on the elections was ``Unanimity in Haiti: Elections Were Chaotic.'' Unfortunately, no one seems to have told the Washington Post's editorial writers. Or, possibly, those writers do not believe that the chaos which, in truth, defined these elections seriously undermined their integrity. If that is the judgement of the Washington Post's editors it is a faulty one, and it cannot withstand the weight of the abundant evidence that the election process--from the campaign season through election day to the ballot counting--was plagued by very grave problems. People can judge for themselves whether these problems have rendered the elections completely unfair and unfree. "", 'The IRI ', ""delegation's responsibility as impartial observers was to simply call them as they saw them. What they saw was rather discouraging, so discouraging that even Aristide's Minister for Culture, Jean-Claude Bajeux, offered an apology. ``As a member of the Government,'' he said, ``I am not proud of this.'' Minister Bajeux went on to observe that ``instead of improving on the 1990 elections, we have done worse.'' Not surprisingly, the widespread irregularities have prompted opposition parties to reject these elections as fraudulent. That charge was leveled by the mayor of Port-au-Prince, Evans Paul, as well. You will recall, Mr. President, that Mayor Paul's post support for President Aristide was often referred to by President Aristide's supporters in the United States. Mr. President, let me offer a brief sampling of the irregularities which the IRI delegation documented. I will first read from the executive summary of IRI's pre-election report which evaluated the pre- electoral process and environment for their comparison to minimal standards of acceptability. The elections were originally to be held in December, but were postponed several times for a variety of reasons. Mr. "", 'President, I ', 'ask unanimous consent that the complete executive summary be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [[', 'Page S ', ""9142]] Executive Summary electoral process The legal foundation for these elections was a Presidential decree that subverted the legislative process. The formulation of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) itself breached an agreement between the President of the Republic and the political parties to allow the parties to nominate all candidates from which CEP members would be chosen by the three branches of government. Only two of the nine CEP members were chosen from the parties' list. The voter registration process, to have been administered by the CEP, was complicated by miscalculations of population size, lack of sufficient materials and registration sites, and one million missing voter registration cards. "", 'The CEP ', ""review of the over 11,000 candidate dossiers for eligibility was a protracted process that occurred under a cloak of secrecy. When the CEP made its decisions known, by radio, no reasons were given for the thousands of candidates rejected. After vehement protests by the parties, some reasons were supplied and supplemental lists were announced through June 14, thirty-one days after the date the final candidate list was to be announced. This stripped the CEP of its credibility with the political parties. There is still not a final list of approved candidates available. The sliding scale of registration fees imposed by the CEP-- whereby political parties with fewer CEP approved candidates pay larger fees--has made it difficult for many parties to compete. As of June 20, five days before the election, protests against this unusual requirement have gone unanswered. The ability of the CEP and those under its direction to administer an election is unclear. As of June 20, five days prior to the election, formal instructions for the procedures of election day and the count had yet to be issued; this has prevented the 45,000 persons needed to administer election day from receiving specific training. As of June 20, those persons designated by the political parties as pollwatchers had not yet received any training from the CEP which could lead to serious confusion on election day. These actions have led to deep misgivings across the Haitian political spectrum about the ability of the CEP to fulfill the mandate and functions normally executed by election commissions. Political parties had no idea to whom to turn with complaints in the process--the CEP, the President of the Republic, the United Nations Electoral Assistance Unit or the United States Government. Three political parties withdrew from the process as a form of protest. electoral environment A concern for security is an issue that has permeated every step of the process. The assassination of Mireille Durocher Bertin, a well-known lawyer and leading political opponent of Aristide, only conformed the fears of the parties and candidates. During the crisis, many elected representatives feared returning to their districts, contributing to the decay of political infrastructure. Candidates have curtailed their campaign activities and has given personal security a higher priority. The campaign itself began late and has been barely visible until some activities in the last week prior to elections. Given the process and environment surrounding these elections, it is doubtful many of Haiti's recognized political parties could have competed effectively. The electorate itself is basically uninformed about this election--what it stands for and who is running. There has been no civic education campaign, with the exception of some limited U.S. and U.N. military efforts, to illuminate the purpose of this election. Similarly, there has been no educational campaign on how to vote, which for a largely illiterate population in Haiti could pose serious difficulties on election day. Compared to other ``transition elections'' observed by IRI, such as in Russia in 1993, El Salvador in 1994, South Africa in 1994 and even China's Jilan Province village elections in 1994, the pre-electoral process and environment in Haiti has seriously challenged the most minimally accepted standards for the holding of a credible election. Mr. "", 'McCAIN.', "" Those are the problems that undermined the integrity of the election before election day. We have all read newspaper accounts over the last 2 days which chronicled the abuses and irregularities that occurred on Sunday. Mr. Goss accurately reported in a press statement yesterday the following serious problems. While the international military served well as a deterrent to widespread violence, the elections were not free of violence and intimidation. Violent incidents closed local polling stations in Port- au-Prince, Limbe, Port de Paix, Don Don, Ferrier, Jean Rabel, Carrefour, and Cite Soleil. The election council failed to deliver and distribute voter materials to a number of polling stations. This resulted in countless delayed voting place openings and postponed the elections in some places. Unsurprisingly, these delays and postponements caused widespread voter frustration which helps explain why turnout was low. There was also widespread disregard for the secrecy of the ballot. Many voters had little choice but to mark their ballots in the open. The thoroughly arbitrary process of qualifying candidates led to serious consequences which we anticipated in our pre-election survey. The disqualification of some candidates proved to destabilize the electoral environment in certain areas, this was most acutely the case in Saint Marc and Jean Rabel. The New York Times reports that at least 200,000 voters are still waiting to cast their ballots, but election officials still won't say when and if they will be allowed to do so. Regarding the vote tally, I will quote not from IRI's report but from the Organization of American States which had a much larger observation team in Haiti. Because of administrative failings in the election it remains to be seen how effectively the count will be carried out. As anyone who read a newspaper today discovered, allegations of widespread abuse and irregularities in the counting process are coming in by the dozens. Again and again, we are hearing from all observers that unmarked ballots are being marked at the regional counting centers to indicate a vote for Lavalas candidates. Mr. President, this is, as I said, only a brief sampling of the problems which IRI observers and all credible observers witnessed. For calling the press' attention to these problems, the IRI mission was chastised today in a Washington Post editorial for unconstructive political science correctness. In response to that charge let me just quote the last two paragraphs of Mr. Goss' statement yesterday as chairman of our delegation. It was important for Haiti and the international community to hold this election, but holding an election is simply not enough. The purpose of this election was to create layers of government that can serve as checks and balances on each other and decentralize power as envisioned by the 1987 Constitution. That is why it was important to have an inclusive process, not one marked by exclusion. It has been IRI's intent throughout this process to be thorough, independent, objective and constructive. In this regard, IRI will maintain a presence in Haiti through the final round of elections and will make recommendations for the formation of the permanent electoral council. This is hardly inflammatory language, Mr. President. In fact, I think most people would consider it as well as all of IRI's reporting to be constructive, informed criticism. Indeed, Brian Atwood, Director of U.S.A.I.D. and head of the Clinton administration's observation delegation in Haiti, said about IRI's reporting: ``they have performed a service.'' The Post's editors are being a little disingenuous, I fear, when they raise the obviously bogus charge of political correctness. After all, that is not a problem that the Post usually finds distressing. What the Post is really saying, as are those hysterical critics of IRI's delegation in the Aristide Government and on the Provisional Electoral Council; What they are really saying is that Haiti should not be expected to adhere to minimally acceptable election process standards. IRI has observed elections in 48 countries. Some of those countries and some of those elections were the subject of disagreements, sometimes, but not always, partisan disagreements in the U.S. Congress. Elections in Chile, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Russia come to mind. Never, not once, has there been the slightest intimation that IRI delegations were anything other than objective, scrupulously fair, committed, hard working professionals. On the contrary, IRI delegations are routinely acclaimed for their thorough professionalism. But because IRI discovered and reported information which, apparently, the Washington Post editorial writers would have preferred to have gone unnoticed, the integrity of these observers--not the election, but the observers--is now called into question by those editorialists and others. What the Post editorial writers and others are really saying is that whatever standards we hold El Salvador to; whatever standards we hold Nicaragua to; whatever standards we hold Croatia to; whatever standards we hold Serbia [["", 'Page S ', ""9143]] to; whatever standards we hold Albania to; whatever standards we hold Bulgaria to; whatever standards we hold Azerbaijan to; whatever standards we hold Russia to; whatever standards to which we hold all these countries where IRI observed elections without controversy, no matter how minimal those standards are we cannot expect Haiti to meet them. Mr. President, that is what the Washington Post said today, and it is an injustice. It is an injustice to IRI; to Mr. Porter Goss and all the good and honorable people on IRI's election observation delegation in Haiti. Most importantly, Mr. President, it is an injustice to the people of Haiti.

Mr. "", 'President, I ', 'yield the floor. ']"
62,"SENDING AMERICAN TROOPS TO BOSNIA Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I feel compelled today to make a couple of statements about the President's message last night. I am very disturbed at what is happening, and I think all of America needs to know what is going on. I commend the President on giving a beautiful, persuasive speech, as he is very good at doing. However, I suggest, Mr. President, that as we are speaking now and as time is creeping by, our troops are on their way to Bosnia. It is my understanding that the distinguished Senator from Colorado, who will be here in just a moment, made a trip over Thanksgiving, which is essentially the same trip I made the week before, into the northeast sector of Bosnia, which is the area where our troops are going to be. A number of people have gone over to Bosnia but have not gone beyond Sarajevo and do not really have a feel for the environment in which our President has this obsession of sending our American troops. Mr. President, last night he talked about morality and about what our moral obligation is in Bosnia, and the fact that we have a moral obligation to see how many people we are going to be able to save from the brutality that could be taking place there. He talked about our commitment to NATO. And I would like to throw out a couple of ideas, a couple of thoughts. Mr. President, when I went to Sarajevo it was the middle of a blizzard, a snowstorm. We had a hard time getting up there. There were not any Americans up there. There were not any Americans going to the northeast sector, that area around the Posavina corridor and Tuzla, and south of Hungary, which is an area where our troops are going to be deployed from the lst Armored Division where they are being trained for this kind of deployment. And that may be happening and is happening, I suggest, as we speak. I heard several people say that we need to wait until we have hearings and let some time go by. But each hour that goes by, the American people need to know the President has a strategy to get our troops over there, to put us in a position where we are going to have to, by denying the authorization of sending troops into Bosnia on the ground, we are turning our backs on troops who are already there. And this is a position that we are now getting into. And each hour that goes by we are getting in deeper and deeper. I can recall not being able to get up there until General Rupert Smith, who is the successor of Michael Rose as the commander there of the U.N. forces in Bosnia, he agreed to take me up. And as we went up we went over almost every square mile of that area that is called the northeast sector, where our troops are going to be deployed, not more than 100 feet off the ground--because I have a background in aviation, [[Page S 17591]] I know we were not anywhere higher than that--we were in the middle of a blizzard. Mr. President, this is not the Rocky Mountains we are talking about. This is an area of cliffs and caves. For the first time I could see why during the Second World War that they were able to withstand the very best that Hitler had to offer on a ratio of 1 to 8 because of the very unique geography we are dealing with. As I looked down I thought, there are not any roads down there, there are not any valleys, not the traditional valleys that you would have in the terrain that we think of as being mountainous terrain. And so all these tanks and all these armored vehicles would not really have any way to maneuver in that area. And, Mr. President, I think the President of the United States is putting us in a position where it is going to be too late. You know, we could come back and talk about whether or not we should send troops over, whether or not there are strategic interests as far as our Nation's security is concerned. And by that time, we are going to have our troops over there. I think the President is looking at--he has been talking about 20,000 or 25,000 troops for so long now, for 2 years, I think it is an obsession with him. He is no longer thinking of them as being faces of real human beings. I think it is a faceless gesture when he says, we want to send 20,000 American troops into Bosnia. But I went up to where the lst Armored Division was training these young men and women who will be the first to go, who I suggest--I had breakfast with many of them in the mess hall. And they are on their way to Bosnia right now as we speak. And those individuals all asked me, ``What is our mission? We don't understand what our mission is.'' Of course, I tried to be as optimistic as possible. I said, ``We're always behind our troops. Whatever happens, we're going to be supporting our troops.'' But as far as the mission is concerned, I do not know what the mission is. In the speech last night the President kept using the term over and over again--he said, ``The mission is clear and limited.'' But he never said what the mission was. It is a humanitarian mission. And I think we have about half the world that is covered with problems, with ethnic cleansing, with human rights violations. I am not sure whether we feel that we--or the President feels that we--have the resources and the military assets to go out and take care of all these problems. Obviously, we do not. We are operating on a defense budget now that is down comparable to what it was in 1980 when it could not afford spare parts. Yet we are taking on all these humanitarian problems around the world. I had occasion to talk to James Tayrien. James Tayrien is from Poteau, OK. He would be one of the first ones to go. I came home and talked to his mother, Estella, down in Poteau. She asked me the same question. I cannot answer it. It is very easy to get engaged in these things and send troops in, but it is hard to bring them out. Look at Vietnam. It was very easy to send them in. Look at the other cases that we have. Mission creep. If there was ever a classical environment for mission creep, that is it over in Bosnia. In fact, we have already crept. The mission was to be peacekeeping. Now it is peace implementation. There is a big difference, Mr. President, between peacekeeping and peace implementation. Peace implementation is the recognition there is no peace to keep right now. The President last night said, of course, the war is over. The war is not over. We went up there. We were in Tuzla. We could hear the firing, the firepower that was going on. It has not stopped. And we are dealing with three major factions over there. And I suggest to you that one of the factions was not in Dayton, OH. Milosevic does not speak for the Bosnian Serbs. It was my experience--and I see the distinguished Senator from Colorado is here. He is the only other Senator or House Member, to my knowledge, who has been in the northeast sector, in the Tuzla area. The point I am trying to get across here is that those people who are around that peace table are not speaking for the factions that were firing guns as we were up there just a couple weeks ago. I mean, they are up there. They could be Croats. They could be Serbs. They could be Bosnian Serbs. They could be Moslems. We do not know who they are. They could be any of these rogue factions. We hear a lot about the major factions that are over there. We know that three major factions have fired on their own troops just to blame the other side for sympathy. Anyone with that mentality is going to be firing on American troops. But we do not say anything about the other rogue factions, such as the Black Swans, the Arkan Tigers. We have Iranians. We have all kinds of factions up there, more than just three major factions. I would like to ask the Senator from Colorado, if that is the same environment as I have just explained that he experienced just this past week? I am sure he would have rather been doing something else on Thanksgiving. But it is my understanding he was up in that northeast sector during Thanksgiving. Is that correct? Mr. BROWN. I did. We had taken a plane, U.N. plane into Sarajevo and got a U.N. crew, a Norwegian helicopter crew, to take us in that region. And we did a flyover over much of that area. I must say the Senator's description is right on. What I found was in that area that is absolutely ideal in terms of guerrilla warfare. What I was surprised to find, and I think Members may be surprised to find, is that the plan is not to set up a border and patrol of that border. In other words, in fact, they indicated many of these areas where the line has been drawn, it simply does not even correspond to things on the ground. It is not the peak of a hill or the depth of a valley or the flow of a river. It is a line on the map that has not been translated on the ground. And their plan is not to erect a fence or even to check people coming across. There would be free flow of people across it. But I found very rugged terrain, and I found the roads that were there were very narrow, and very heavy timber cover so that it would be very difficult to spot things from the air. And it would be almost impossible to get our armored personnel carriers and our armored vehicles, tanks, into full play in that region. It is as difficult a situation from a terrain point of view as I have seen almost anywhere. Mr. INHOFE. Let me ask the Senator from Colorado, since this was about a 10-day period between the time I was in the northeast sector of Bosnia, south of the Posavina pass and south of Hungary and north of Tuzla, if he did have occasion to speak to any of those who were in command up in Tuzla, such as General Haukland? Mr. BROWN. I did talk to the Norwegian general. He said he would be relieved when the U.S. troops came in. I also talked to Gen. Rupert Smith in charge of the U.N. forces there, as well as a discussion at the Embassy with all the U.S. forces. As the Senator knows, there is a number of U.S. military personnel who are stationed in Sarajevo. They indicated a couple of things. One, none of them expected this to be wound up within a year. Mr. INHOFE. This is the question I was going to ask the Senator. Even last night we talked about 12 months. When the Senator and I sat next to each other at the Senate Armed Services Committee, when we had Secretary Perry and General Shalikashvili, and we asked the question that they had written up, ``Are you going to commit yourself to 12 months, to a time period after which we withdraw and we come back?'' they said, ``Yes, we are absolutely committed to that.'' Did you find anyone, who were the military people, either with NATO, the United Nations, with any of our NATO partners, or anyone up there in the Tuzla area who felt there is even a remote idea or notion we could be out of there in a 12-month period as far as achieving peace? Mr. BROWN. I talked to Norwegian personnel, military personnel from Iceland. There were doctors there from Sweden. I talked to a general from Great Britain. I talked to U.S. military personnel. I talked to Embassy personnel. I talked to Bosnian officials. Nobody, not anyone, none of them thought this mission could be achieved or completed within a year. [[Page S 17592]] Mr. INHOFE. That is exactly what they thought 10 days prior to that time. I have these horrible visions of what happened with Somalia. I can remember when we were trying to bring our troops back from Somalia, and we sent resolutions to President Clinton month after month to bring our troops back from there. It was not until 18 of our Rangers were murdered and the mutilated corpses were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu that the American people finally woke up and said, ``We want them back. We don't have strategic interests there that are worth this kind of a sacrifice.'' I see similar things like this are happening over there. When you talk about the morality of the issue and the fact that we are, in a sense, rewarding those individuals who are guilty of the most serious war crimes, because we are now saying we are on their side and we are doing this, this is something that I think we need to talk about before a decision is made that we are going to go along with this, because I see that happening. I see discussions taking place in this Chamber and outside the Chamber, ``Well, let's wait until we have some hearings. Let's wait until this,'' and as this is happening, our troops are being deployed over there. Mr. BROWN. Let me say to the Senator, if I can, in response, I think it is very analogous to what happened in Somalia in this respect: There is not a clear military plan. There is not a clear plan as to what we are going to do once we are there. For example, one of the things you could do is put up a fence and man a border. That is not what they plan to do. One of the things you can do is you can stop people from moving from one side of a border to another, stemming terrorism, guns, ammunition. That is not what they plan to do. When I asked what they do plan to do with the troops there, there was no clear answer by anyone. The reality is, the President is committing troops to that area for show. There is no clear military plan, and there is no clear, effective way to defend or protect those troops. I might say, it is cold as can be right now in Bosnia. There is no structure there for our troops to stay in. There is no structure there for our troops to stay in. There is no supply of clean, healthful water. There are no normal sanitary conditions. There is no established supply line at this point. I suspect there will be at some point in the future. But this is a catastrophe in the making, and I believe it shows a reckless disregard for those who serve our country. I think we have an obligation to people who put on the uniform of this Nation. You can agree or disagree with the mission, you can agree or disagree with the personalities, but we have an obligation when someone comes and puts on the uniform of the United States to make sure that we do not endanger their life without a real purpose. Some will say we should not endanger their life. If you are not willing to put your life on the line, you should not be in the military. I understand how these men and women would risk their lives, and our freedom is important enough to do that. But, Mr. President, and I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, keeping our prestige high or avoiding an embarrassment because someone made a commitment they should not have is not a reason to commit American troops to a situation where they cannot defend themselves or cost American lives. We have an obligation to people who put on that uniform to stand beside them and do all we can to protect them, and it is very clear--it is very clear--that we are not able to do that in this circumstance, and, moreover, we have not even supplied them with a purpose or a reason for them to sacrifice their lives. If they were there to defend freedom, I think the Senator from Oklahoma and I would be right there with them to stand behind them and support them and to encourage this action to stand up for freedom. But this is not that effort. This is an effort to save face in the world community, and I think it is much more important to stand behind our troops. Mr. INHOFE. Let me ask the Senator from Colorado---- Mr. PRESSLER. If my friends will yield for a split moment, we are trying to get a vote ordered at 5:15, and I have to make a unanimous consent request. If I can do that, then you can go back into your mode, because they are going to hotline this. Mr. INHOFE. I yield to the Senator.

But I went up to where the lst Armored Division was training these young men and women who will be the first to go, who I suggest--I had breakfast with many of them in the mess hall. And they are on their way to Bosnia right now as we speak. And those individuals all asked me, ``What is our mission? We don't understand what our mission is.'' Of course, I tried to be as optimistic as possible. I said, ``We're always behind our troops. Whatever happens, we're going to be supporting our troops.'' But as far as the mission is concerned, I do not know what the mission is. In the speech last night the President kept using the term over and over again--he said, ``The mission is clear and limited.'' But he never said what the mission was. It is a humanitarian mission. And I think we have about half the world that is covered with problems, with ethnic cleansing, with human rights violations. I am not sure whether we feel that we--or the President feels that we--have the resources and the military assets to go out and take care of all these problems. Obviously, we do not. We are operating on a defense budget now that is down comparable to what it was in 1980 when it could not afford spare parts. Yet we are taking on all these humanitarian problems around the world. I had occasion to talk to James Tayrien. James Tayrien is from Poteau, OK. He would be one of the first ones to go. I came home and talked to his mother, Estella, down in Poteau. She asked me the same question. I cannot answer it. It is very easy to get engaged in these things and send troops in, but it is hard to bring them out. Look at Vietnam. It was very easy to send them in. Look at the other cases that we have. Mission creep. If there was ever a classical environment for mission creep, that is it over in Bosnia. In fact, we have already crept. The mission was to be peacekeeping. Now it is peace implementation. There is a big difference, Mr. President, between peacekeeping and peace implementation. Peace implementation is the recognition there is no peace to keep right now. The President last night said, of course, the war is over. The war is not over. We went up there. We were in Tuzla. We could hear the firing, the firepower that was going on. It has not stopped. And we are dealing with three major factions over there. And I suggest to you that one of the factions was not in Dayton, OH. Milosevic does not speak for the Bosnian Serbs. It was my experience--and I see the distinguished Senator from Colorado is here. He is the only other Senator or House Member, to my knowledge, who has been in the northeast sector, in the Tuzla area. The point I am trying to get across here is that those people who are around that peace table are not speaking for the factions that were firing guns as we were up there just a couple weeks ago. I mean, they are up there. They could be Croats. They could be Serbs. They could be Bosnian Serbs. They could be Moslems. We do not know who they are. They could be any of these rogue factions. We hear a lot about the major factions that are over there. We know that three major factions have fired on their own troops just to blame the other side for sympathy. Anyone with that mentality is going to be firing on American troops. But we do not say anything about the other rogue factions, such as the Black Swans, the Arkan Tigers. We have Iranians. We have all kinds of factions up there, more than just three major factions. I would like to ask the Senator from Colorado, if that is the same environment as I have just explained that he experienced just this past week? I am sure he would have rather been doing something else on Thanksgiving. But it is my understanding he was up in that northeast sector during Thanksgiving. Is that correct? Mr. BROWN. I did. We had taken a plane, U.N. plane into Sarajevo and got a U.N. crew, a Norwegian helicopter crew, to take us in that region. And we did a flyover over much of that area. I must say the Senator's description is right on. What I found was in that area that is absolutely ideal in terms of guerrilla warfare. What I was surprised to find, and I think Members may be surprised to find, is that the plan is not to set up a border and patrol of that border. In other words, in fact, they indicated many of these areas where the line has been drawn, it simply does not even correspond to things on the ground. It is not the peak of a hill or the depth of a valley or the flow of a river. It is a line on the map that has not been translated on the ground. And their plan is not to erect a fence or even to check people coming across. There would be free flow of people across it. But I found very rugged terrain, and I found the roads that were there were very narrow, and very heavy timber cover so that it would be very difficult to spot things from the air. And it would be almost impossible to get our armored personnel carriers and our armored vehicles, tanks, into full play in that region. It is as difficult a situation from a terrain point of view as I have seen almost anywhere. Mr. INHOFE. Let me ask the Senator from Colorado, since this was about a 10-day period between the time I was in the northeast sector of Bosnia, south of the Posavina pass and south of Hungary and north of Tuzla, if he did have occasion to speak to any of those who were in command up in Tuzla, such as General Haukland? Mr. BROWN. I did talk to the Norwegian general. He said he would be relieved when the U.S. troops came in. I also talked to Gen. Rupert Smith in charge of the U.N. forces there, as well as a discussion at the Embassy with all the U.S. forces. As the Senator knows, there is a number of U.S. military personnel who are stationed in Sarajevo. They indicated a couple of things. One, none of them expected this to be wound up within a year. Mr. INHOFE. This is the question I was going to ask the Senator. Even last night we talked about 12 months. When the Senator and I sat next to each other at the Senate Armed Services Committee, when we had Secretary Perry and General Shalikashvili, and we asked the question that they had written up, ``Are you going to commit yourself to 12 months, to a time period after which we withdraw and we come back?'' they said, ``Yes, we are absolutely committed to that.'' Did you find anyone, who were the military people, either with NATO, the United Nations, with any of our NATO partners, or anyone up there in the Tuzla area who felt there is even a remote idea or notion we could be out of there in a 12-month period as far as achieving peace? Mr. BROWN. I talked to Norwegian personnel, military personnel from Iceland. There were doctors there from Sweden. I talked to a general from Great Britain. I talked to U.S. military personnel. I talked to Embassy personnel. I talked to Bosnian officials. Nobody, not anyone, none of them thought this mission could be achieved or completed within a year. [[Page S 17592]] Mr. INHOFE. That is exactly what they thought 10 days prior to that time. I have these horrible visions of what happened with Somalia. I can remember when we were trying to bring our troops back from Somalia, and we sent resolutions to President Clinton month after month to bring our troops back from there. It was not until 18 of our Rangers were murdered and the mutilated corpses were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu that the American people finally woke up and said, ``We want them back. We don't have strategic interests there that are worth this kind of a sacrifice.'' I see similar things like this are happening over there. When you talk about the morality of the issue and the fact that we are, in a sense, rewarding those individuals who are guilty of the most serious war crimes, because we are now saying we are on their side and we are doing this, this is something that I think we need to talk about before a decision is made that we are going to go along with this, because I see that happening. I see discussions taking place in this Chamber and outside the Chamber, ``Well, let's wait until we have some hearings. Let's wait until this,'' and as this is happening, our troops are being deployed over there. Mr. BROWN. Let me say to the Senator, if I can, in response, I think it is very analogous to what happened in Somalia in this respect: There is not a clear military plan. There is not a clear plan as to what we are going to do once we are there. For example, one of the things you could do is put up a fence and man a border. That is not what they plan to do. One of the things you can do is you can stop people from moving from one side of a border to another, stemming terrorism, guns, ammunition. That is not what they plan to do. When I asked what they do plan to do with the troops there, there was no clear answer by anyone. The reality is, the President is committing troops to that area for show. There is no clear military plan, and there is no clear, effective way to defend or protect those troops. I might say, it is cold as can be right now in Bosnia. There is no structure there for our troops to stay in. There is no structure there for our troops to stay in. There is no supply of clean, healthful water. There are no normal sanitary conditions. There is no established supply line at this point. I suspect there will be at some point in the future. But this is a catastrophe in the making, and I believe it shows a reckless disregard for those who serve our country. I think we have an obligation to people who put on the uniform of this Nation. You can agree or disagree with the mission, you can agree or disagree with the personalities, but we have an obligation when someone comes and puts on the uniform of the United States to make sure that we do not endanger their life without a real purpose. Some will say we should not endanger their life. If you are not willing to put your life on the line, you should not be in the military. I understand how these men and women would risk their lives, and our freedom is important enough to do that. But, Mr. President, and I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, keeping our prestige high or avoiding an embarrassment because someone made a commitment they should not have is not a reason to commit American troops to a situation where they cannot defend themselves or cost American lives. We have an obligation to people who put on that uniform to stand beside them and do all we can to protect them, and it is very clear--it is very clear--that we are not able to do that in this circumstance, and, moreover, we have not even supplied them with a purpose or a reason for them to sacrifice their lives. If they were there to defend freedom, I think the Senator from Oklahoma and I would be right there with them to stand behind them and support them and to encourage this action to stand up for freedom. But this is not that effort. This is an effort to save face in the world community, and I think it is much more important to stand behind our troops. Mr. INHOFE. Let me ask the Senator from Colorado---- Mr. PRESSLER. If my friends will yield for a split moment, we are trying to get a vote ordered at 5:15, and I have to make a unanimous consent request. If I can do that, then you can go back into your mode, because they are going to hotline this. Mr. INHOFE. I yield to the Senator. ","['Mr. INHOFE.', ' Mr. ', 'President, I ', ""feel compelled today to make a couple of statements about the President's message last night. I am very disturbed at what is happening, and I think all of America needs to know what is going on. I commend the President on giving a beautiful, persuasive speech, as he is very good at doing. "", 'However, I ', 'suggest, Mr. President, that as we are speaking now and as time is creeping by, our troops are on their way to Bosnia. It is my understanding that the distinguished Senator from Colorado, who will be here in just a moment, made a trip over Thanksgiving, which is essentially the same trip I made the week before, into the northeast sector of Bosnia, which is the area where our troops are going to be. A number of people have gone over to Bosnia but have not gone beyond Sarajevo and do not really have a feel for the environment in which our President has this obsession of sending our American troops. Mr. President, last night he talked about morality and about what our moral obligation is in Bosnia, and the fact that we have a moral obligation to see how many people we are going to be able to save from the brutality that could be taking place there. He talked about our commitment to ', 'NATO.', ' ', 'And I ', 'would like to throw out a couple of ideas, a couple of thoughts. Mr. President, when I went to Sarajevo it was the middle of a blizzard, a snowstorm. We had a hard time getting up there. There were not any Americans up there. There were not any Americans going to the northeast sector, that area around the Posavina corridor and Tuzla, and south of Hungary, which is an area where our troops are going to be deployed from the lst Armored Division where they are being trained for this kind of deployment. And that may be happening and is happening, I suggest, as we speak. I heard several people say that we need to wait until we have hearings and let some time go by. But each hour that goes by, the American people need to know the President has a strategy to get our troops over there, to put us in a position where we are going to have to, by denying the authorization of sending troops into Bosnia on the ground, we are turning our backs on troops who are already there. And this is a position that we are now getting into. And each hour that goes by we are getting in deeper and deeper. I can recall not being able to get up there until General Rupert Smith, who is the successor of Michael Rose as the commander there of the U.N. forces in Bosnia, he agreed to take me up. And as we went up we went over almost every square mile of that area that is called the northeast sector, where our troops are going to be deployed, not more than 100 feet off the ground--because I have a background in aviation, [[', 'Page S ', '17591]] I know we were not anywhere higher than that--we were in the middle of a blizzard. Mr. President, this is not the Rocky Mountains we are talking about. This is an area of cliffs and caves. For the first time I could see why during the Second World War that they were able to withstand the very best that Hitler had to offer on a ratio of 1 to 8 because of the very unique geography we are dealing with. ', 'As I ', 'looked down I thought, there are not any roads down there, there are not any valleys, not the traditional valleys that you would have in the terrain that we think of as being mountainous terrain. And so all these tanks and all these armored vehicles would not really have any way to maneuver in that area. And, Mr. ', 'President, I ', ""think the President of the United States is putting us in a position where it is going to be too late. You know, we could come back and talk about whether or not we should send troops over, whether or not there are strategic interests as far as our Nation's security is concerned. And by that time, we are going to have our troops over there. I think the President is looking at--he has been talking about 20,000 or 25,000 troops for so long now, for 2 years, I think it is an obsession with him.

63,"PRESIDENT CLINTON'S VISIT TO ENGLAND, NORTHERN IRELAND, AND IRELAND Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join Senator Kennedy in congratulating President Clinton on his successful trip to the United Kingdom and Ireland. Although I was not able to accept the President's invitation to accompany him on that historic visit due to other commitments I had in Vermont, like millions of Americans I followed his travels closely in the press. One of the most memorable events was the President's speech to the workers at the Mackie Metal Plant in Belfast. Mackie's is located on the Peace Line which has historically divided Catholics from Protestants. People from both communities come together at Mackie's to an integrated work force where they work side by side. At Mackie's, President Clinton spoke of those who helped bring about the peace process--the political leaders, and more importantly, the people of Northern Ireland ``who have shown the world in concrete ways that here the will for peace is now stronger than the weapons for war.'' The President called for an end to punishment beatings as well as for the full participation in the democratic process of those who have renounced violence. He said that the United States will stand with those who take risks for peace. The President spoke for all of us that day and I ask unanimous consent that his remarks be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Remarks by the President to Employees and Community of the Mackie Metal Plant [Belfast, Northern Ireland, Nov. 30, 1995] This is one of those occasions where I really feel that all that needs to be said has already been said. I thank Catherine and David for introducing me, for all the school children of Northern Ireland who are here today, and for all whom they represent. A big part of peace is children growing up safely, learning together and growing together. I thank Patrick Dougan and Ronnie Lewis for their remarks, for their work here, for all the members of the Mackie team who are with us today in welcoming us to this factory. I was hoping we could have an event like this in Northern Ireland at a place where people work and reach out to the rest of the world in a positive way, because a big part of peace is working together for family and community and for the welfare of the common enterprise. It is good to be among the people of Northern Ireland who have given so much to America and the world, and good to be here with such a large delegation of my fellow Americans, including, of course, my wife, and I see the Secretary of Commerce here and the Ambassador to Great Britain, and a number of others. But we have quite a large delegation from both parties in the United States Congress, so we've sort of got a truce of our own going on here today. (Laughter.) And I'd like to ask the members of Congress who have come all the way from Washington, D.C. to stand up and be recognized. Would you all stand? (Applause.) Many of you perhaps know that one in four of America's Presidents trace their roots to Ireland's shores, beginning with Andrew Jackson, the son of immigrants from Carrickfergus, to John Fitzgerald Kennedy whose forebears came from County Wexford. I know I am only the latest in this time-honored tradition, but I'm proud to be the first sitting American President to make it back to Belfast. (Applause.) At this holiday season all around the world, the promise of peace is in the air. The barriers of the Cold War are giving way to a global village where communication and cooperation are the order of the day. From South Africa to the Middle East, and now to troubled Bosnia, conflicts long thought impossible to solve are moving along the road to resolution. Once-bitter foes are clasping hands and changing history. And long-suffering people are moving closer to normal lives. Here in Northern Ireland, you are making a miracle--a miracle symbolized by those two children who held hands and told us what this whole thing is all about. In the land of the harp and the fiddle, the fife and the lambeg drum, two proud traditions are coming together in the harmonies of peace. The cease-fire and negotiations have sparked a powerful transformation. [[Page S 18091]] Mackie's Plant is a symbol of Northern Ireland's rebirth. It has long been a symbol of world-class engineering. The textile machines you make permit people to weave disparate threads into remarkable fabrics. That is now what you must do here with the people of Northern Ireland. Here we lie along the peace line, the wall of steel and stone separating Protestant from Catholic. But today, under the leadership of Pat Dougan, you are bridging the divide, overcoming a legacy of discrimination where fair employment and integration are the watchwords of the future. On this shop floor men and women of both traditions are working together to achieve common goals. Peace, once a distant dream, is now making a difference in everyday life in this land. Soldiers have left the streets of Belfast; many have gone home. People can go to the pub or the store without the burden of the search or the threat of a bomb. As barriers disappear along the border, families and communities divided for decades are becoming whole once more. This year in Armagh on St. Patrick's Day, Protestant and Catholic children led the parade together for the first time since The Troubles began. A bystander's words marked the wonder of the occasion when he said, ``Even the normal is beginning to seem normal.'' The economic rewards of peace are evident as well. Unemployment has fallen here to its lowest level in 14 years, while retail sales and investment are surging. Far from the gleaming city center, to the new shop fronts of Belfast, to the Enterprise Center in East Belfast, business is thriving and opportunities are expanding. With every extra day that the guns are still, business confidence grows stronger and the promise of prosperity grows as well. As the shroud of terror melts away, Northern Ireland's beauty has been revealed again to all the world--the castles and coasts, the Giants Causeway, the lush green hills, the high white cliffs--a magical backdrop to your greatest asset which I saw all along the way from the airport here today, the warmth and good feeling of your people. Visitors are now coming in record numbers. Indeed, today, the air route between Belfast and London is the second busiest in all of Europe. I want to honor those whose courage and vision have brought us to this point: Prime Minister Major, Prime Minister Bruton, and before him, Prime Minister Reynolds, laid the background and the basis for this era of reconciliation. From the Downing Street Declaration to the joint framework document, they altered the course of history. Now, just in the last few days, by launching the twin-track initiative, they have opened a promising new gateway to a just and lasting peace. Foreign Minister Spring, Sir Patrick Mayhew, David Trimble and John Hume all have labored to realize the promise of peace. And Gerry Adams, along with Loyalist leaders such as David Irvine and Gary McMichael, helped to silence the guns on the streets and to bring about the first peace in a generation. But most of all, America salutes all the people of Northern Ireland who have shown the world in concrete ways that here the will for peace is now stronger than the weapons of war. With mixed sporting events encouraging competition on the playing field, not the battlefield; with women's support groups, literacy programs, job training centers that served both communities--these and countless other initiatives bolster the foundations of peace as well. Last year's cease-fire of the Irish Republican Army, joined by the combined Loyalist Military Command, marked a turning point in the history of Northern Ireland. Now is the time to sustain that momentum and lock in the gains of peace. Neither community wants to go back to the violence of the past. The children told of that today. Both parties must do their part to move this process forward now. Let me begin by saying that the search for common ground demands the courage of an open mind. This twin-track initiative gives the parties a chance to begin preliminary talks in ways in which all views will be represented and all voices will be heard. It also establishes an international body to address the issue of arms decommissioning. I hope the parties will seize this opportunity. Engaging in honest dialogue is not an act of surrender, it is an act of strength and common sense. (Applause.) Moving from cease-fire to peace requires dialogue. For 25 years now the history of Northern Ireland has been written in the blood of its children and their parents. The cease-fire turned the page on that history; it must not be allowed to turn back. (Applause.) There must also be progress away from the negotiating table. Violence has lessened, but it has not disappeared. The leaders of the four main churches recently condemned the so- called punishment beatings and called for an end to such attacks. I add my voice to theirs. (Applause.) As the church leaders said, this is a time when the utmost efforts on all sides are needed to build a peaceful and confident community in the future. But true peace requires more than a treaty, even more than the absence of violence. Those who have suffered most in the fighting must share fairly in the fruits of renewal. The frustration that gave rise to violence must give way to faith in the future. The United States will help to secure the tangible benefits of peace. Ours is the first American administration ever to support in the Congress the International Fund for Ireland, which has become an engine for economic development and for reconciliation. We will continue to encourage trade and investment and to help end the cycle of unemployment. We are proud to support Northern Ireland. You have given America a very great deal. Irish Protestant and Irish Catholic together have added to America's strength. From our battle for independence down to the present day, the Irish have not only fought in our wars, they have built our nation, and we owe you a very great debt. (Applause.) Let me say that of all the gifts we can offer in return, perhaps the most enduring and the most precious is the example of what is possible when people find unity and strength in their diversity. We know from our own experience even today how hard that is to do. After all, we fought a great Civil War over the issue of race and slavery in which hundreds of thousands of our people were killed. Today, in one of our counties alone, in Los Angeles, there are over 150 different ethnic and racial groups represented. We know we can become stronger if we bridge our differences. But we learned in our own Civil War that that has to begin with a change of the heart. I grew up in the American South, in one of the states that tried to break from the American Union. My forebears on my father's side were soldiers in the Confederate Army. I was reading the other day a book about our first governor after the Civil War who fought for the Union Army, and who lost members of his own family. They lived the experience so many of you have lived. When this governor took office and looked out over a sea of his fellow citizens who fought on the other side, he said these words: ``We have all done wrong. No one can say his heart is altogether clean and his hands altogether pure. Thus, as we wish to be forgiven, let us forgive those who have sinned against us and ours.'' That was the beginning of America's reconciliation, and it must be the beginning of Northern Ireland's reconciliation. (Applause.) It is so much easier to believe that our differences matter more than what we have in common. It is easier, but it is wrong. We all cherish family and faith, work and community. We all strive to live lives that are free and honest and responsible. We all want our children to grow up in a world where their talents are matched by their opportunities. And I believe those values are just as strong in County Londonderry as they are in Londonderry, New Hampshire; in Belfast, Northern Ireland as in Belfast, Maine. I am proud to be of Ulster Scots stock. I am proud to be, also, of Irish stock. I share these roots with millions and millions of Americans, now over 40 million Americans. And we rejoice at things being various, as Louis MacNeice once wrote. It is one of the things that makes America special. Because our greatness flows from the wealth of our diversity as well as the strength of the ideals we share in common, we feel bound to support others around the world who seek to bridge their own divides. This is an important part of our country's mission on the eve of the 21st century, because we know that the chain of peace that protects us grows stronger with every new link that is forged. For the first time in half a century now, we can put our children to bed at night knowing that the nuclear weapons of the former Soviet Union are no longer pointed at those children. In South Africa, the long night of apartheid has given way to a new freedom for all peoples. In the Middle East, Arabs and Israelis are stepping beyond war to peace in an area where many believed peace would never come. In Haiti, a brutal dictatorship has given way to a fragile new democracy. In Europe, the dream of a stable, undivided free continent seems finally within reach as the people of Bosnia have the first real hope for peace since the terrible fighting began there nearly four years ago. The United States looks forward to working with our allies here in Europe and others to help the people in Bosnia--the Muslims, the Croats, the Serbs--to move beyond their divisions and their destructions to make the peace agreement they have made a reality in the lives of their people. Those who work for peace have got to support one another. We know that when leaders stand up for peace, they place their forces on the line, and sometimes their very lives on the line, as we learned so recently in the tragic murder of the brave Prime Minister of Israel. For, just as peace has its pioneers, peace will always have its rivals. Even when children stand up and say what these children said today, there will always be people who, deep down inside, will never be able to give up the past. Over the last three years I have had the privilege of meeting with and closely listening to both Nationalists and Unionists from Northern Ireland, and I believe that the greatest struggle you face now is not between opposing ideas or opposing interests. The greatest struggle you face is between those who, deep down inside, are inclined to be peacemakers, and those who, deep down inside, cannot yet embrace the cause of peace. Between those who are in the ship of peace and those who are trying to sink it, old habits die hard. There will always be those who define the worth of their lives not by who they are, but by who they aren't; not [[Page S 18092]] by what they're for, but by what they are against. They will never escape the dead-end street of violence. But you, the vast majority, Protestant and Catholic alike, must not allow the ship of peace to sink on the rocks of old habits and hard grudges. (Applause.) You must stand firm against terror. You must say to those who still would use violence for political objectives--you are the past; your day is over. Violence has no place at the table of democracy, and no role in the future of this land. By the same token, you must also be willing to say to those who renounce violence and who do take their own risks for peace that they are entitled to be full participants in the democratic process. Those who show the courage--(applause)-- those who do show the courage to break with the past are entitled to their stake in the future. As leaders for peace become invested in the process, as leaders make compromises and risk the backlash, people begin more and more--I have seen this all over the world--they begin more and more to develop a common interest in each other's success; in standing together rather than standing apart. They realize that the sooner they get to true peace, with all the rewards it brings, the sooner it will be easy to discredit and destroy the forces of destruction. We will stand with those who take risks for peace, in Northern Ireland and around the world. I pledge that we will do all we can, through the International Fund for Ireland and in many other ways, to ease your load. If you walk down this path continually, you will not walk alone. We are entering an era of possibility unparalleled in all of human history. If you enter that era determined to build a new age of peace, the United States of America will proudly stand with you. (Applause.) But at the end of the day, as with all free people, your future is for you to decide. Your destiny is for you to determine. Only you can decide between division and unity, between hard lives and high hopes. Only you can create a lasting peace. It takes courage to let go of familiar divisions. It takes faith to walk down a new road. But when we see the bright gaze of these children, we know the risk is worth the reward. I have been so touched by the thousands of letters I have received from schoolchildren here, telling me what peace means to them. One young girl from Ballymena wrote--and I quote--``It is not easy to forgive and forget, especially for those who have lost a family member or a close friend. However, if people could look to the future with hope instead of the past with fear, we can only be moving in the right direction.'' I couldn't have said it nearly as well. I believe you can summon the strength to keep moving forward. After all, you have come so far already. You have braved so many dangers, you have endured so many sacrifices. Surely, there can be no turning back. But peace must be waged with a warrior's resolve--bravely, proudly, and relentlessly--secure in the knowledge of the single, greatest difference between war and peace: In peace, everybody can win. (Applause.) I was overcome today when I landed in my plane and I drove with Hillary up the highway to come here by the phenomenal beauty of the place and the spirit and the goodwill of the people. Northern Ireland has a chance not only to begin anew, but to be a real inspiration to the rest of the world, a model of progress through tolerance. Let us join our efforts together as never before to make that dream a reality. Let us join our prayers in this season of peace for a future of peace in this good land. Thank you very much. (Applause.)

Mr. President, I join Senator Kennedy in congratulating President Clinton on his successful trip to the United Kingdom and Ireland. Although I was not able to accept the President's invitation to accompany him on that historic visit due to other commitments I had in Vermont, like millions of Americans I followed his travels closely in the press. One of the most memorable events was the President's speech to the workers at the Mackie Metal Plant in Belfast. Mackie's is located on the Peace Line which has historically divided Catholics from Protestants. People from both communities come together at Mackie's to an integrated work force where they work side by side. At Mackie's, President Clinton spoke of those who helped bring about the peace process--the political leaders, and more importantly, the people of Northern Ireland ``who have shown the world in concrete ways that here the will for peace is now stronger than the weapons for war.'' The President called for an end to punishment beatings as well as for the full participation in the democratic process of those who have renounced violence. He said that the United States will stand with those who take risks for peace. The President spoke for all of us that day and I ask unanimous consent that his remarks be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Remarks by the President to Employees and Community of the Mackie Metal Plant [Belfast, Northern Ireland, Nov. 30, 1995] This is one of those occasions where I really feel that all that needs to be said has already been said. I thank Catherine and David for introducing me, for all the school children of Northern Ireland who are here today, and for all whom they represent. A big part of peace is children growing up safely, learning together and growing together. I thank Patrick Dougan and Ronnie Lewis for their remarks, for their work here, for all the members of the Mackie team who are with us today in welcoming us to this factory. I was hoping we could have an event like this in Northern Ireland at a place where people work and reach out to the rest of the world in a positive way, because a big part of peace is working together for family and community and for the welfare of the common enterprise. It is good to be among the people of Northern Ireland who have given so much to America and the world, and good to be here with such a large delegation of my fellow Americans, including, of course, my wife, and I see the Secretary of Commerce here and the Ambassador to Great Britain, and a number of others. But we have quite a large delegation from both parties in the United States Congress, so we've sort of got a truce of our own going on here today. (Laughter.) And I'd like to ask the members of Congress who have come all the way from Washington, D.C. to stand up and be recognized. Would you all stand? (Applause.) Many of you perhaps know that one in four of America's Presidents trace their roots to Ireland's shores, beginning with Andrew Jackson, the son of immigrants from Carrickfergus, to John Fitzgerald Kennedy whose forebears came from County Wexford. I know I am only the latest in this time-honored tradition, but I'm proud to be the first sitting American President to make it back to Belfast. (Applause.) At this holiday season all around the world, the promise of peace is in the air. The barriers of the Cold War are giving way to a global village where communication and cooperation are the order of the day. From South Africa to the Middle East, and now to troubled Bosnia, conflicts long thought impossible to solve are moving along the road to resolution. Once-bitter foes are clasping hands and changing history. And long-suffering people are moving closer to normal lives. Here in Northern Ireland, you are making a miracle--a miracle symbolized by those two children who held hands and told us what this whole thing is all about. In the land of the harp and the fiddle, the fife and the lambeg drum, two proud traditions are coming together in the harmonies of peace. The cease-fire and negotiations have sparked a powerful transformation. [[Page S 18091]] Mackie's Plant is a symbol of Northern Ireland's rebirth. It has long been a symbol of world-class engineering. The textile machines you make permit people to weave disparate threads into remarkable fabrics. That is now what you must do here with the people of Northern Ireland. Here we lie along the peace line, the wall of steel and stone separating Protestant from Catholic. But today, under the leadership of Pat Dougan, you are bridging the divide, overcoming a legacy of discrimination where fair employment and integration are the watchwords of the future. On this shop floor men and women of both traditions are working together to achieve common goals. Peace, once a distant dream, is now making a difference in everyday life in this land. Soldiers have left the streets of Belfast; many have gone home. People can go to the pub or the store without the burden of the search or the threat of a bomb. As barriers disappear along the border, families and communities divided for decades are becoming whole once more. This year in Armagh on St. Patrick's Day, Protestant and Catholic children led the parade together for the first time since The Troubles began. A bystander's words marked the wonder of the occasion when he said, ``Even the normal is beginning to seem normal.'' The economic rewards of peace are evident as well. Unemployment has fallen here to its lowest level in 14 years, while retail sales and investment are surging. Far from the gleaming city center, to the new shop fronts of Belfast, to the Enterprise Center in East Belfast, business is thriving and opportunities are expanding. With every extra day that the guns are still, business confidence grows stronger and the promise of prosperity grows as well. As the shroud of terror melts away, Northern Ireland's beauty has been revealed again to all the world--the castles and coasts, the Giants Causeway, the lush green hills, the high white cliffs--a magical backdrop to your greatest asset which I saw all along the way from the airport here today, the warmth and good feeling of your people. Visitors are now coming in record numbers. Indeed, today, the air route between Belfast and London is the second busiest in all of Europe. I want to honor those whose courage and vision have brought us to this point: Prime Minister Major, Prime Minister Bruton, and before him, Prime Minister Reynolds, laid the background and the basis for this era of reconciliation. From the Downing Street Declaration to the joint framework document, they altered the course of history. Now, just in the last few days, by launching the twin-track initiative, they have opened a promising new gateway to a just and lasting peace. Foreign Minister Spring, Sir Patrick Mayhew, David Trimble and John Hume all have labored to realize the promise of peace. And Gerry Adams, along with Loyalist leaders such as David Irvine and Gary McMichael, helped to silence the guns on the streets and to bring about the first peace in a generation. But most of all, America salutes all the people of Northern Ireland who have shown the world in concrete ways that here the will for peace is now stronger than the weapons of war. With mixed sporting events encouraging competition on the playing field, not the battlefield; with women's support groups, literacy programs, job training centers that served both communities--these and countless other initiatives bolster the foundations of peace as well.

From the Downing Street Declaration to the joint framework document, they altered the course of history. Now, just in the last few days, by launching the twin-track initiative, they have opened a promising new gateway to a just and lasting peace. Foreign Minister Spring, Sir Patrick Mayhew, David Trimble and John Hume all have labored to realize the promise of peace. And Gerry Adams, along with Loyalist leaders such as David Irvine and Gary McMichael, helped to silence the guns on the streets and to bring about the first peace in a generation. But most of all, America salutes all the people of Northern Ireland who have shown the world in concrete ways that here the will for peace is now stronger than the weapons of war. With mixed sporting events encouraging competition on the playing field, not the battlefield; with women's support groups, literacy programs, job training centers that served both communities--these and countless other initiatives bolster the foundations of peace as well. Last year's cease-fire of the Irish Republican Army, joined by the combined Loyalist Military Command, marked a turning point in the history of Northern Ireland. Now is the time to sustain that momentum and lock in the gains of peace. Neither community wants to go back to the violence of the past. The children told of that today. Both parties must do their part to move this process forward now. Let me begin by saying that the search for common ground demands the courage of an open mind. This twin-track initiative gives the parties a chance to begin preliminary talks in ways in which all views will be represented and all voices will be heard. It also establishes an international body to address the issue of arms decommissioning. I hope the parties will seize this opportunity. Engaging in honest dialogue is not an act of surrender, it is an act of strength and common sense. (Applause.) Moving from cease-fire to peace requires dialogue. For 25 years now the history of Northern Ireland has been written in the blood of its children and their parents. The cease-fire turned the page on that history; it must not be allowed to turn back. (Applause.) There must also be progress away from the negotiating table. Violence has lessened, but it has not disappeared. The leaders of the four main churches recently condemned the so- called punishment beatings and called for an end to such attacks. I add my voice to theirs. (Applause.) As the church leaders said, this is a time when the utmost efforts on all sides are needed to build a peaceful and confident community in the future. But true peace requires more than a treaty, even more than the absence of violence. Those who have suffered most in the fighting must share fairly in the fruits of renewal. The frustration that gave rise to violence must give way to faith in the future. The United States will help to secure the tangible benefits of peace. Ours is the first American administration ever to support in the Congress the International Fund for Ireland, which has become an engine for economic development and for reconciliation. We will continue to encourage trade and investment and to help end the cycle of unemployment. We are proud to support Northern Ireland. You have given America a very great deal. Irish Protestant and Irish Catholic together have added to America's strength. From our battle for independence down to the present day, the Irish have not only fought in our wars, they have built our nation, and we owe you a very great debt. (Applause.) Let me say that of all the gifts we can offer in return, perhaps the most enduring and the most precious is the example of what is possible when people find unity and strength in their diversity. We know from our own experience even today how hard that is to do. After all, we fought a great Civil War over the issue of race and slavery in which hundreds of thousands of our people were killed. Today, in one of our counties alone, in Los Angeles, there are over 150 different ethnic and racial groups represented. We know we can become stronger if we bridge our differences. But we learned in our own Civil War that that has to begin with a change of the heart. I grew up in the American South, in one of the states that tried to break from the American Union. My forebears on my father's side were soldiers in the Confederate "", 'Army. I ', ""was reading the other day a book about our first governor after the Civil War who fought for the Union Army, and who lost members of his own family. They lived the experience so many of you have lived. When this governor took office and looked out over a sea of his fellow citizens who fought on the other side, he said these words: ``We have all done wrong. No one can say his heart is altogether clean and his hands altogether pure. Thus, as we wish to be forgiven, let us forgive those who have sinned against us and ours.'' That was the beginning of America's reconciliation, and it must be the beginning of Northern Ireland's reconciliation. (Applause.) It is so much easier to believe that our differences matter more than what we have in common. It is easier, but it is wrong. We all cherish family and faith, work and community. We all strive to live lives that are free and honest and responsible. We all want our children to grow up in a world where their talents are matched by their opportunities. "", 'And I ', 'believe those values are just as strong in County Londonderry as they are in Londonderry, New Hampshire; in Belfast, Northern Ireland as in Belfast, ', 'Maine. I ', ""am proud to be of Ulster Scots stock. I am proud to be, also, of Irish stock. I share these roots with millions and millions of Americans, now over 40 million Americans. And we rejoice at things being various, as Louis MacNeice once wrote. It is one of the things that makes America special. Because our greatness flows from the wealth of our diversity as well as the strength of the ideals we share in common, we feel bound to support others around the world who seek to bridge their own divides. This is an important part of our country's mission on the eve of the 21st century, because we know that the chain of peace that protects us grows stronger with every new link that is forged. For the first time in half a century now, we can put our children to bed at night knowing that the nuclear weapons of the former Soviet Union are no longer pointed at those children. In South Africa, the long night of apartheid has given way to a new freedom for all peoples. In the Middle East, Arabs and Israelis are stepping beyond war to peace in an area where many believed peace would never come. In Haiti, a brutal dictatorship has given way to a fragile new democracy. In Europe, the dream of a stable, undivided free continent seems finally within reach as the people of Bosnia have the first real hope for peace since the terrible fighting began there nearly four years ago. The United States looks forward to working with our allies here in Europe and others to help the people in Bosnia--the Muslims, the Croats, the Serbs--to move beyond their divisions and their destructions to make the peace agreement they have made a reality in the lives of their people. Those who work for peace have got to support one another. We know that when leaders stand up for peace, they place their forces on the line, and sometimes their very lives on the line, as we learned so recently in the tragic murder of the brave Prime Minister of Israel. For, just as peace has its pioneers, peace will always have its rivals. Even when children stand up and say what these children said today, there will always be people who, deep down inside, will never be able to give up the past. Over the last three years I have had the privilege of meeting with and closely listening to both Nationalists and Unionists from Northern Ireland, and I believe that the greatest struggle you face now is not between opposing ideas or opposing interests. The greatest struggle you face is between those who, deep down inside, are inclined to be peacemakers, and those who, deep down inside, cannot yet embrace the cause of peace. Between those who are in the ship of peace and those who are trying to sink it, old habits die hard. There will always be those who define the worth of their lives not by who they are, but by who they aren't; not [["", 'Page S ', ""18092]] by what they're for, but by what they are against. They will never escape the dead-end street of violence. But you, the vast majority, Protestant and Catholic alike, must not allow the ship of peace to sink on the rocks of old habits and hard grudges. (Applause.) You must stand firm against terror. You must say to those who still would use violence for political objectives--you are the past; your day is over. Violence has no place at the table of democracy, and no role in the future of this land. By the same token, you must also be willing to say to those who renounce violence and who do take their own risks for peace that they are entitled to be full participants in the democratic process. Those who show the courage--(applause)-- those who do show the courage to break with the past are entitled to their stake in the future. As leaders for peace become invested in the process, as leaders make compromises and risk the backlash, people begin more and more--I have seen this all over the world--they begin more and more to develop a common interest in each other's success; in standing together rather than standing apart. They realize that the sooner they get to true peace, with all the rewards it brings, the sooner it will be easy to discredit and destroy the forces of destruction. We will stand with those who take risks for peace, in Northern Ireland and around the world. I pledge that we will do all we can, through the International Fund for Ireland and in many other ways, to ease your load. If you walk down this path continually, you will not walk alone. We are entering an era of possibility unparalleled in all of human history. If you enter that era determined to build a new age of peace, the United States of America will proudly stand with you. (Applause.) But at the end of the day, as with all free people, your future is for you to decide. Your destiny is for you to determine. Only you can decide between division and unity, between hard lives and high hopes. Only you can create a lasting peace. It takes courage to let go of familiar divisions. It takes faith to walk down a new road. But when we see the bright gaze of these children, we know the risk is worth the reward. I have been so touched by the thousands of letters I have received from schoolchildren here, telling me what peace means to them. One young girl from Ballymena wrote--and I quote--``It is not easy to forgive and forget, especially for those who have lost a family member or a close friend. However, if people could look to the future with hope instead of the past with fear, we can only be moving in the right direction.'' I couldn't have said it nearly as well. I believe you can summon the strength to keep moving forward. After all, you have come so far already. You have braved so many dangers, you have endured so many sacrifices. Surely, there can be no turning back. But peace must be waged with a warrior's resolve--bravely, proudly, and relentlessly--secure in the knowledge of the single, greatest difference between war and peace: In peace, everybody can win. (Applause.) I was overcome today when I landed in my plane and I drove with Hillary up the highway to come here by the phenomenal beauty of the place and the spirit and the goodwill of the people. Northern Ireland has a chance not only to begin anew, but to be a real inspiration to the rest of the world, a model of progress through tolerance. Let us join our efforts together as never before to make that dream a reality. Let us join our prayers in this season of peace for a future of peace in this good land. Thank you very much. (Applause.) ""]"
64,"SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER CALLS FOR U.N. REFORM Mr. PELL. Mr. President, yesterday Secretary of State Warren Christopher delivered an important address to the U.N. General Assembly. Secretary Christopher's speech, which was made at the initiation of the 50th session of the General Assembly, was remarkable not only for the milestone it commemorated, but for the forward- thinking approach it took to the issue of U.N. reform. Recent congressional debates have demonstrated that continued U.S. support for the United Nations hinges on the issue of reform. At a time when some members of Congress are questioning the fundamental utility of U.S. participation in the United Nations, it is imperative that the U.N. perform its duties effectively and in a cost-efficient manner. As Secretary Christopher said last night, It is time to recognize that the UN must direct its limited resources to the world's highest priorities, focusing on the tasks that it performs best. The UN's bureaucracy should be smaller, with a clear organizational structure and sharp lines of responsibility. Each program must be held to a simple standard--that is, it must make a tangible contribution to the freedom, security, and well-being of real people in the real world. Mr. President, as one who was present at the creation of the United Nations, I have tried very hard to see the U.N. live up to its potential and have seen the good works of which it is capable. I underscore and applaud the Secretary of State's call for reform. His initiative has my full support, and I hope it will receive the support of the Congress as well. The very future of the United Nations, and the success of many of our own national security objectives, depend upon it. Mr. President, I commend the Secretary's address to my colleagues and ask unanimous consent that the full text of his remarks be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. Department of State, Office of the Spokesman, New York, NY, September 25, 1995. Remarks by Secretary of State Warren Christopher to the 50th Session of the United Nations General Assembly Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Excellencies, Distinguished Guests: It is a privilege to speak to you today on behalf of the United States. A half-century ago, the General Assembly first met in New York--across the river in a converted skating rink at Flushing Meadows. In those modest surroundings, our predecessors began to put into place an ambitious framework they hoped would keep the peace as successfully as they had prosecuted the war. In the years since, the United Nations has helped to bring peace, prosperity and hope to countless people around the world. Technological change has brought nations closer together than the UN's founders could possibly have foreseen. The United Nations itself has been challenged in unforeseen ways. It has had to manage complex humanitarian emergencies, from civil wars to the mass movement of refugees to health epidemics. This evolution has placed great strains on the organization, and revealed the necessity for far-reaching change in how it is run. The Clinton Administration has vigorously made the case to our Congress and our people for continued American leadership at the UN. The United States made a commitment to the UN Charter 50 years ago. We are determined to keep our commitment, including our financial obligations. We will always remember that for millions of people around the world, the UN is far from a faceless institution: It is, as Harry Truman once said, ``a case of food or a box of school books; it is a doctor who vaccinates their children; it is an expert who shows them how to raise more rice, or more wheat.'' To millions more, it is the difference between peace and war. Economic and social development, as well as protection of human rights, remain central to the UN's mission. But the UN must change to meet these needs more effectively. When money is wasted in New York, Geneva, or Vienna, and when time is lost to bureaucratic inertia, the people who pay the price are those most vulnerable to famine, disease and violence. It is time to recognize that the UN must direct its limited resources to the world's highest priorities, focusing on the tasks that it performs best. The UN's bureaucracy should be smaller, with a clear organizational structure and sharp lines of responsibility. Each program must be held to a simple standard--that is, it must make a tangible contribution to the freedom, security, and well-being of real people in the real world. In the last two years, under the leadership of Secretary- General Boutros-Ghali, the groundwork for substantial change has been laid. The UN has an office with the functions of an inspector general, and a mandate to crack down on waste and fraud. Under-Secretary-General Joe Connor has embarked on an aggressive campaign to improve the UN's management culture, and we fully support his work. The UN Secretariat has moved in the right direction by submitting a budget that begins to restrain spending. Now the momentum for reform must accelerate. Let me propose a concrete agenda: First, we must end UN programs that have achieved their purpose, and consolidate programs that overlap, especially in the economic and social agencies. The UN has more than a dozen organizations responsible for development, emergency response, and statistical reporting. We should consider establishing a single agency for each of these functions. We should downsize the UN's regional economic commissions. We should ensure that the functions of the UN Conference on Trade and Development do not duplicate the new WTO. And we should adopt a moratorium on big UN conferences once the present series is completed, concentrating instead on meeting the commitments of those we have held. Second, we need to streamline the UN Secretariat to make it more efficient, accountable and transparent. Each part of the UN system should be subject to the scrutiny of an inspector general. The UN must not tolerate ethical or financial abuses and its managers should be appointed and promoted on the basis of merit. Third, we should rigorously scrutinize proposals for new and extended peacekeeping missions, and we should improve the UN's ability to respond rapidly when new missions are approved. We must agree on an equitable scale of peacekeeping assessments that reflects today's economic realities. And we should have a unified budget for peacekeeping operations. Finally, we must maintain the effectiveness of the Security Council. Germany and Japan should become permanent members. We should ensure that all the world's regions are fairly represented, without making the Council unwieldy. We welcome the formation of the high-level group on reform, initiated under the leadership of outgoing General Assembly President Essy. Our goal must be that a practical blueprint for UN reform will be adopted before the General Assembly's 50th Session finishes work next fall. The way forward is clear: We have already seen countless [[Page S 14280]] studies and reports. The time has come to act on the best proposals. As you know, in my country there have been serious efforts to curtail our support for the United Nations. The Clinton Administration believes it would be reckless to turn away from an organization that helps mobilize the support of other nations for goals that are consistent with American and global interests. But to sustain support for the UN among the American people and the people of other nations, it is not enough that we defend the institution. The best argument against retreat is further reform. Tangible progress will help us win the battle for UN support that we are waging in the United States. The United Nations must emerge from the reform process better able to meet its fundamental goals, including the preservation of peace and security. From Korea, to the Persian Gulf, to Haiti, the UN has provided a mandate to its members as they carried out this responsibility. The UN's own blue helmets have helped nations create the basic conditions of peace in some of the most difficult situations imaginable, even though they have not always fully achieved their intended purpose. Recently, a young Haitian father was asked what peacekeeping forces had achieved in his country. ``We walk freely,'' he answered. ``We sleep quietly. There are no men who come for us in the night.'' In Haiti, as for example in Cambodia, Mozambique and El Salvador, the UN has shown that peacekeeping, for all of its limitations, has been an enormously useful instrument. Our region where UN forces and the international community have played a critical role is the Middle East. Another historic milestone will be marked this Thursday in Washington when Israel and the Palestinians sign their agreement to implement phase two of the Declaration of Principles. That agreement will bring to life a goal first set in the Camp David accords--that is, to protect Israel's security and to give Palestinians throughout the West Bank control over their daily lives. The international community and the UN must continue to support this process politically and economically. Without a doubt, the UN has never undertaken a mission more difficult than the one in the former Yugoslavia. The limitations of that mission are well known. But we must also recognize that it has provided relief for hundreds of thousands of people and saved thousands of lives. Today, with diplomacy backed by force, the United States and the international community are moving forward on a track that is producing genuinely hopeful results. The United Nations and NATO are working together effectively to bring peace to the region. On September 8 in Geneva, the parties to the conflict accepted the fundamental goal the Security Council has often expressed--namely, the continuation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a single state within its current internationally recognized borders. When I meet with the foreign ministers of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia later today, I will urge them to maintain momentum toward peace and to establish constitutional structures for Bosnia. The framers of the UN Charter created this institution to meet threats to peace and security posed by aggression and armed conflict. These threats are still very much with us. But the world also faces a set of new security challenges, including proliferation, terrorism, international crime and narcotics, as well as the far-reaching consequences of damage to the environment. These have assumed a new and dangerous scope in a more interdependent world. As President Clinton said in San Francisco in June, the ``new forces of integration carry within them the seeds of disintegration and destruction.'' While new technologies have brought us closer together, they have also made it easier for terrorists, drug dealers, and other international criminals to acquire weapons of mass destruction, to set up cocaine cartels, and to hide their ill-gotten gains. The collapse of communism has shattered dictatorships. But it has also left the political and legal institutions of newly liberated nations even more vulnerable to those who seek to subvert them. Although these threats are sometimes sponsored by states, they increasingly follow no flag. Each of us must vigorously fight these enemies on our own. But we will never be truly secure until we effectively fight them together. That is the new security challenge for the global community. It must be the new security mission of the UN. There is no area where the UN can make a more significant contribution than in nonproliferation. Fifty years ago, the United States was the only country capable of making a nuclear bomb. Today, many countries have the technology that would enable them to turn a fist-sized chunk of plutonium into a bomb as small as a suitcase. That is one reason why more than 170 countries agreed to extend for all time the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty last May, at the conference chaired here by Ambassador Dhanapala. We must build on that achievement. First, we should have a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ready for signature by the time we meet here next year. As President Clinton announced last moth, the United States is committed to a true zero-yield test ban. We urge other nations to join us in that commitment. Second, we should immediately start negotiations on a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty. Those who have been most vocal in calling for nuclear disarmament should recognize that it is essential to ban future production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. Third, we should push forward with the historic reductions of the nuclear arsenals of the United States and the countries of the former Soviet Union. I call on the U.S. Senate, as well as the Russian Duma, to approve the START II Treaty so that we can lock in deep cuts in our strategic nuclear arsenals. In addition, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin are working together to ensure the safety, transparency and irreversibility of nuclear arms reductions. As part of this process, President Yeltsin will host a Nuclear Safety and Security Summit in Moscow next spring. The Summit should have an ambitious agenda, including a declaration of principles on nuclear reactor safety. We look to the summit to address the worldwide problem of nuclear waste management, including ocean dumping. The Summit should also promote a plan of action to Safeguard nuclear materials. That plan should include new measures to prevent criminals and terrorists from acquiring nuclear material for use in weapons. Finally, we should push for the earliest possible entry- into-force of the Chemical Weapons Convention. President Clinton has urged the U.S. Senate to act promptly on its ratification, and to stop holding it and the START II treaty hostage to unrelated issues. The world has witnessed the effect of poison gas too many times in this century--on European battlefields during World War I, in Ethiopia and Manchuria during the 1930s, and against Iranian soldiers and innocent Kurdish civilians in the 1980s. The Chemical Weapons Convention will make every nation safer, and we need it now. The UN is also playing an invaluable role in focusing attention on pressing regional poliferation problems. In Iraq UNSCOM and its chairman Rolf Ekeus continue to uncover horrific details about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. Under Saddam Hussein, Iraq developed a deadly biological weapons capacity hidden from view. It was conducting research to turn some of the most toxic substances known to man into weapons of war. We know Saddam succeeded in putting anthrax and botulism in bombs and missile warheads. In December 1990, he deployed these with every intent to using them against the international coalition and innocent civilians. He was dissuaded only by the steadfast determination of the United States and the international community. In light of what Ambassador Ekeus has uncovered, we can only conclude that for the last four and a half years Saddam Hussein has lied about the full scope of Iraq's weapons programs. There should be no easing of the sanctions regime until the Iraqi government complies with all the demands of the Security Council and demonstrates that it has changed its ways. The UN should also promote responsibility and restraint in the transfer of conventional weapons. Last year at the General Assembly, President Clinton proposed, and the Assembly approved, the eventual elimination of antipersonnel landmines. On my recent trip to Cambodia, I saw the terrible damage these hidden killers can do. This year, we will again call on other countries to join us in ending the export of landmines. Two years ago, President Clinton called on the international community to devise a true international system that governs transfers of conventional weapons and sensitive dual-use technologies. I am pleased that the Russian Federation has joined with the United States and 26 other countries to agree on common principles to control the build- up of dangerous conventional arms. We hope to activate this global regime, called the New Forum, by the end of this year. The proliferation of weapons has added a disturbing dimension to another threat we all face: international terrorism. Indeed, this year's sarin gas attack in Tokyo is a grim warning of what can happen when terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction. More nations are joining the fight against those individuals and groups who attack civilians for political ends. The United Nations has supported this effort in important ways. The UN Security Council recognized the importance of countering state-sponsored terrorism by imposing sanctions against Libya for the bombing of Pan Am 103 and UTA 772. Terrorists should be treated as criminals and there must be no place where they can hide from the consequences of their acts. States that sponsor terrorists should feel the full weight of sanctions that can be imposed by the international community. Let us not deceive ourselves: Every dollar that goes into the government coffers of a state sponsor of terrorism such as Iran helps pay for a terrorist's bullets or bombs. Iran's role as the foremost state sponsor of terrorism makes its secret quest for weapons of mass destruction even more alarming. We must stand together to prevent Iran from acquiring such threatening capabilities. The United States has taken a leading role in meeting the international terrorist threat. We have intensified our sanctions against Iran. Last January, President Clinton also issued an Executive Order prohibiting financial transactions with terrorist groups and individuals who threaten the Middle East peace process. We are urging our Congress to tighten our immigration and criminal laws to keep terrorists on the run or put them behind bars. The United States strongly supports the counter-terrorism measures the G-7 and Russia announced at the Halifax Summit, and [[Page S 14281]] we expect the P-8 Ministerial Meeting on Terrorism in Ottawa to produce a concrete action plan to implement these measures. Other kinds of international crime also threaten the safety of our citizens and the fabric of our societies. And globalization brings new and frightening dimensions to crime. The threat of crime is a particular menace to young democracies. It weakens confidence in institutions, preys on the most vulnerable, and undermines free market reform. Of course, every country must take its own measures to combat these threats. The Clinton Administration is now completing a review of our approach to transnational crime that will lead to a stronger, more coordinated attack on this problem. To help other states deal with criminal threats, the United States and Hungary have created the International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest to train police officers and law enforcement officials from Central Europe and the states of the former Soviet Union. We are providing similar help bilaterally and through the UN Drug Control Program to countries whose laws are challenged by drug cartels. A particularly insidious form of crime and corruption is money laundering. All nations should implement recommendations by the OECD to attack money laundering. The nations of this hemisphere should also advance the anti-money laundering initiative introduced at last December's Summit of the Americas. Together, we must squeeze the dirty money out of our global financial system. Through the UN's conventions on drugs and crime, the international community has set strong standards that we must now enforce. We call on UN member states who have not already joined the 1988 UN Drug Convention to do so. Those countries who have approved the convention should move quickly to implement its key provisions. We are increasingly aware that damage to the environment and unsustainable population growth threaten the security of our nations and the well-being of our peoples. Their harmful effects are evident in famines, infant mortality rates, refugee crises, and ozone depletion. In places like Rwanda and Somalia, they contribute to civil wars and emergencies that can only be resolved by costly international intervention. We must carry out the commitments we made at last year's Cairo Conference, and the Rio Conference three years ago. Never have our problems been more complex. It has never been more evident that these problems affect all nations, developed and developing, alike. Only by working together can we effectively deal with the new threats we all face. That is why, on this 50th anniversary year, we must shape the UN's agenda as if we were creating the institution anew. Just as the UN's founders devised a new framework to deter aggression and armed conflict, the United Nations, in particular the Security Council, must now assign the same priority to combating the threat posed by proliferation, terrorism, international crime, narcotics, and environmental pollution. We should dedicate our efforts in the UN and elsewhere to turning our global consensus against these threats into concrete action. We must renew and reform the United Nations not for its sake, but for our own. Thank you very much. Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

Each program must be held to a simple standard--that is, it must make a tangible contribution to the freedom, security, and well-being of real people in the real world. In the last two years, under the leadership of Secretary- General Boutros-Ghali, the groundwork for substantial change has been laid. The UN has an office with the functions of an inspector general, and a mandate to crack down on waste and fraud. Under-Secretary-General Joe Connor has embarked on an aggressive campaign to improve the UN's management culture, and we fully support his work. The UN Secretariat has moved in the right direction by submitting a budget that begins to restrain spending. Now the momentum for reform must accelerate. Let me propose a concrete agenda: First, we must end UN programs that have achieved their purpose, and consolidate programs that overlap, especially in the economic and social agencies. The UN has more than a dozen organizations responsible for development, emergency response, and statistical reporting. We should consider establishing a single agency for each of these functions. We should downsize the UN's regional economic commissions. We should ensure that the functions of the UN Conference on Trade and Development do not duplicate the new WTO. And we should adopt a moratorium on big UN conferences once the present series is completed, concentrating instead on meeting the commitments of those we have held. Second, we need to streamline the UN Secretariat to make it more efficient, accountable and transparent. Each part of the UN system should be subject to the scrutiny of an inspector general. The UN must not tolerate ethical or financial abuses and its managers should be appointed and promoted on the basis of merit. Third, we should rigorously scrutinize proposals for new and extended peacekeeping missions, and we should improve the UN's ability to respond rapidly when new missions are approved. We must agree on an equitable scale of peacekeeping assessments that reflects today's economic realities. And we should have a unified budget for peacekeeping operations. Finally, we must maintain the effectiveness of the Security Council. Germany and Japan should become permanent members. We should ensure that all the world's regions are fairly represented, without making the Council unwieldy. We welcome the formation of the high-level group on reform, initiated under the leadership of outgoing General Assembly President Essy. Our goal must be that a practical blueprint for UN reform will be adopted before the General Assembly's 50th Session finishes work next fall. The way forward is clear: We have already seen countless [[Page S 14280]] studies and reports. The time has come to act on the best proposals. As you know, in my country there have been serious efforts to curtail our support for the United Nations. The Clinton Administration believes it would be reckless to turn away from an organization that helps mobilize the support of other nations for goals that are consistent with American and global interests. But to sustain support for the UN among the American people and the people of other nations, it is not enough that we defend the institution. The best argument against retreat is further reform. Tangible progress will help us win the battle for UN support that we are waging in the United States. The United Nations must emerge from the reform process better able to meet its fundamental goals, including the preservation of peace and security. From Korea, to the Persian Gulf, to Haiti, the UN has provided a mandate to its members as they carried out this responsibility. The UN's own blue helmets have helped nations create the basic conditions of peace in some of the most difficult situations imaginable, even though they have not always fully achieved their intended purpose. Recently, a young Haitian father was asked what peacekeeping forces had achieved in his country. ``We walk freely,'' he answered. ``We sleep quietly. There are no men who come for us in the night.'' In Haiti, as for example in Cambodia, Mozambique and El Salvador, the UN has shown that peacekeeping, for all of its limitations, has been an enormously useful instrument. Our region where UN forces and the international community have played a critical role is the Middle East. Another historic milestone will be marked this Thursday in Washington when Israel and the Palestinians sign their agreement to implement phase two of the Declaration of Principles. That agreement will bring to life a goal first set in the Camp David accords--that is, to protect Israel's security and to give Palestinians throughout the West Bank control over their daily lives. The international community and the UN must continue to support this process politically and economically. Without a doubt, the UN has never undertaken a mission more difficult than the one in the former Yugoslavia. The limitations of that mission are well known. But we must also recognize that it has provided relief for hundreds of thousands of people and saved thousands of lives. Today, with diplomacy backed by force, the United States and the international community are moving forward on a track that is producing genuinely hopeful results. The United Nations and NATO are working together effectively to bring peace to the region. On September 8 in Geneva, the parties to the conflict accepted the fundamental goal the Security Council has often expressed--namely, the continuation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a single state within its current internationally recognized borders. When I meet with the foreign ministers of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia later today, I will urge them to maintain momentum toward peace and to establish constitutional structures for Bosnia. The framers of the UN Charter created this institution to meet threats to peace and security posed by aggression and armed conflict. These threats are still very much with us. But the world also faces a set of new security challenges, including proliferation, terrorism, international crime and narcotics, as well as the far-reaching consequences of damage to the environment. These have assumed a new and dangerous scope in a more interdependent world. As President Clinton said in San Francisco in June, the ``new forces of integration carry within them the seeds of disintegration and destruction.'' While new technologies have brought us closer together, they have also made it easier for terrorists, drug dealers, and other international criminals to acquire weapons of mass destruction, to set up cocaine cartels, and to hide their ill-gotten gains. The collapse of communism has shattered dictatorships. But it has also left the political and legal institutions of newly liberated nations even more vulnerable to those who seek to subvert them. Although these threats are sometimes sponsored by states, they increasingly follow no flag. Each of us must vigorously fight these enemies on our own. But we will never be truly secure until we effectively fight them together. That is the new security challenge for the global community. It must be the new security mission of the UN. There is no area where the UN can make a more significant contribution than in nonproliferation. Fifty years ago, the United States was the only country capable of making a nuclear bomb. Today, many countries have the technology that would enable them to turn a fist-sized chunk of plutonium into a bomb as small as a suitcase. That is one reason why more than 170 countries agreed to extend for all time the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty last May, at the conference chaired here by Ambassador Dhanapala. We must build on that achievement. First, we should have a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ready for signature by the time we meet here next year. As President Clinton announced last moth, the United States is committed to a true zero-yield test ban. We urge other nations to join us in that commitment. Second, we should immediately start negotiations on a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty. Those who have been most vocal in calling for nuclear disarmament should recognize that it is essential to ban future production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. Third, we should push forward with the historic reductions of the nuclear arsenals of the United States and the countries of the former Soviet Union. I call on the U.S. Senate, as well as the Russian Duma, to approve the START II Treaty so that we can lock in deep cuts in our strategic nuclear arsenals. In addition, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin are working together to ensure the safety, transparency and irreversibility of nuclear arms reductions. As part of this process, President Yeltsin will host a Nuclear Safety and Security Summit in Moscow next spring. The Summit should have an ambitious agenda, including a declaration of principles on nuclear reactor safety. We look to the summit to address the worldwide problem of nuclear waste management, including ocean dumping. The Summit should also promote a plan of action to Safeguard nuclear materials. That plan should include new measures to prevent criminals and terrorists from acquiring nuclear material for use in weapons. Finally, we should push for the earliest possible entry- into-force of the Chemical Weapons Convention. President Clinton has urged the U.S. Senate to act promptly on its ratification, and to stop holding it and the START II treaty hostage to unrelated issues. The world has witnessed the effect of poison gas too many times in this century--on European battlefields during World War I, in Ethiopia and Manchuria during the 1930s, and against Iranian soldiers and innocent Kurdish civilians in the 1980s. The Chemical Weapons Convention will make every nation safer, and we need it now. The UN is also playing an invaluable role in focusing attention on pressing regional poliferation problems. In Iraq UNSCOM and its chairman Rolf Ekeus continue to uncover horrific details about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. Under Saddam Hussein, Iraq developed a deadly biological weapons capacity hidden from view. It was conducting research to turn some of the most toxic substances known to man into weapons of war. We know Saddam succeeded in putting anthrax and botulism in bombs and missile warheads. In December 1990, he deployed these with every intent to using them against the international coalition and innocent civilians. He was dissuaded only by the steadfast determination of the United States and the international community. In light of what Ambassador Ekeus has uncovered, we can only conclude that for the last four and a half years Saddam Hussein has lied about the full scope of Iraq's weapons programs. There should be no easing of the sanctions regime until the Iraqi government complies with all the demands of the Security Council and demonstrates that it has changed its ways. The UN should also promote responsibility and restraint in the transfer of conventional weapons. Last year at the General Assembly, President Clinton proposed, and the Assembly approved, the eventual elimination of antipersonnel landmines. On my recent trip to Cambodia, I saw the terrible damage these hidden killers can do. This year, we will again call on other countries to join us in ending the export of landmines. Two years ago, President Clinton called on the international community to devise a true international system that governs transfers of conventional weapons and sensitive dual-use technologies. I am pleased that the Russian Federation has joined with the United States and 26 other countries to agree on common principles to control the build- up of dangerous conventional arms. We hope to activate this global regime, called the New Forum, by the end of this year. The proliferation of weapons has added a disturbing dimension to another threat we all face: international terrorism. Indeed, this year's sarin gas attack in Tokyo is a grim warning of what can happen when terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction. More nations are joining the fight against those individuals and groups who attack civilians for political ends. The United Nations has supported this effort in important ways. The UN Security Council recognized the importance of countering state-sponsored terrorism by imposing sanctions against Libya for the bombing of Pan Am 103 and UTA 772. Terrorists should be treated as criminals and there must be no place where they can hide from the consequences of their acts. States that sponsor terrorists should feel the full weight of sanctions that can be imposed by the international community. Let us not deceive ourselves: Every dollar that goes into the government coffers of a state sponsor of terrorism such as Iran helps pay for a terrorist's bullets or bombs. Iran's role as the foremost state sponsor of terrorism makes its secret quest for weapons of mass destruction even more alarming. We must stand together to prevent Iran from acquiring such threatening capabilities. The United States has taken a leading role in meeting the international terrorist threat. We have intensified our sanctions against Iran. Last January, President Clinton also issued an Executive Order prohibiting financial transactions with terrorist groups and individuals who threaten the Middle East peace process. We are urging our Congress to tighten our immigration and criminal laws to keep terrorists on the run or put them behind bars. The United States strongly supports the counter-terrorism measures the G-7 and Russia announced at the Halifax Summit, and [[Page S 14281]] we expect the P-8 Ministerial Meeting on Terrorism in Ottawa to produce a concrete action plan to implement these measures. Other kinds of international crime also threaten the safety of our citizens and the fabric of our societies. And globalization brings new and frightening dimensions to crime. The threat of crime is a particular menace to young democracies. It weakens confidence in institutions, preys on the most vulnerable, and undermines free market reform. Of course, every country must take its own measures to combat these threats. The Clinton Administration is now completing a review of our approach to transnational crime that will lead to a stronger, more coordinated attack on this problem. To help other states deal with criminal threats, the United States and Hungary have created the International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest to train police officers and law enforcement officials from Central Europe and the states of the former Soviet Union. We are providing similar help bilaterally and through the UN Drug Control Program to countries whose laws are challenged by drug cartels. A particularly insidious form of crime and corruption is money laundering. All nations should implement recommendations by the OECD to attack money laundering. The nations of this hemisphere should also advance the anti-money laundering initiative introduced at last December's Summit of the Americas. Together, we must squeeze the dirty money out of our global financial system. Through the UN's conventions on drugs and crime, the international community has set strong standards that we must now enforce. We call on UN member states who have not already joined the 1988 UN Drug Convention to do so. Those countries who have approved the convention should move quickly to implement its key provisions. We are increasingly aware that damage to the environment and unsustainable population growth threaten the security of our nations and the well-being of our peoples. Their harmful effects are evident in famines, infant mortality rates, refugee crises, and ozone depletion. In places like Rwanda and Somalia, they contribute to civil wars and emergencies that can only be resolved by costly international intervention. We must carry out the commitments we made at last year's Cairo Conference, and the Rio Conference three years ago. Never have our problems been more complex. It has never been more evident that these problems affect all nations, developed and developing, alike. Only by working together can we effectively deal with the new threats we all face. That is why, on this 50th anniversary year, we must shape the UN's agenda as if we were creating the institution anew. Just as the UN's founders devised a new framework to deter aggression and armed conflict, the United Nations, in particular the Security Council, must now assign the same priority to combating the threat posed by proliferation, terrorism, international crime, narcotics, and environmental pollution. We should dedicate our efforts in the UN and elsewhere to turning our global consensus against these threats into concrete action. We must renew and reform the United Nations not for its sake, but for our own. Thank you very much. Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. ","['Mr. PELL.', "" Mr. President, yesterday Secretary of State Warren Christopher delivered an important address to the U.N. General Assembly. Secretary Christopher's speech, which was made at the initiation of the 50th session of the General Assembly, was remarkable not only for the milestone it commemorated, but for the forward- thinking approach it took to the issue of U.N. reform. Recent congressional debates have demonstrated that continued U.S. support for the United Nations hinges on the issue of reform. At a time when some members of Congress are questioning the fundamental utility of U.S. participation in the United Nations, it is imperative that the U.N. perform its duties effectively and in a cost-efficient manner. As Secretary Christopher said last night, It is time to recognize that the UN must direct its limited resources to the world's highest priorities, focusing on the tasks that it performs best. "", ""The UN'"", 's bureaucracy should be smaller, with a clear organizational structure and sharp lines of responsibility. Each program must be held to a simple standard--that is, it must make a tangible contribution to the freedom, security, and well-being of real people in the real world. Mr. President, as one who was present at the creation of the United ', 'Nations, I ', ""have tried very hard to see the U.N. live up to its potential and have seen the good works of which it is capable. I underscore and applaud the Secretary of State's call for reform. His initiative has my full support, and I hope it will receive the support of the Congress as well. The very future of the United Nations, and the success of many of our own national security objectives, depend upon it. Mr. "", 'President, I ', ""commend the Secretary's address to my colleagues and ask unanimous consent that the full text of his remarks be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. Department of State, Office of the Spokesman, New "", 'York, NY,', ' September 25, 1995. Remarks by Secretary of State Warren Christopher to the 50th Session of the United Nations General Assembly Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Excellencies, Distinguished Guests: It is a privilege to speak to you today on behalf of the United ', 'States. A ', ""half-century ago, the General Assembly first met in New York--across the river in a converted skating rink at Flushing Meadows. In those modest surroundings, our predecessors began to put into place an ambitious framework they hoped would keep the peace as successfully as they had prosecuted the war. In the years since, the United Nations has helped to bring peace, prosperity and hope to countless people around the world. Technological change has brought nations closer together than the UN's founders could possibly have foreseen. The United Nations itself has been challenged in unforeseen ways. It has had to manage complex humanitarian emergencies, from civil wars to the mass movement of refugees to health epidemics. This evolution has placed great strains on the organization, and revealed the necessity for far-reaching change in how it is run. The Clinton Administration has vigorously made the case to our Congress and our people for continued American leadership at the UN. The United States made a commitment to the UN Charter 50 years ago. We are determined to keep our commitment, including our financial obligations. We will always remember that for millions of people around the world, the UN is far from a faceless institution: It is, as Harry Truman once said, ``a case of food or a box of school books; it is a doctor who vaccinates their children; it is an expert who shows them how to raise more rice, or more wheat.'' To millions more, it is the difference between peace and war. Economic and social development, as well as protection of human rights, remain central to the UN's mission. But the UN must change to meet these needs more effectively. When money is wasted in New York, Geneva, or Vienna, and when time is lost to bureaucratic inertia, the people who pay the price are those most vulnerable to famine, disease and violence. It is time to recognize that the UN must direct its limited resources to the world's highest priorities, focusing on the tasks that it performs best.

65,"SENDING UNITED STATES TROOPS TO BOSNIA Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wanted to speak this morning in response to President Clinton's address to the Nation last night regarding the sending of American troops to Bosnia. I think the President made a strong case for support for his position, but I do not think that he made a strong enough case to justify sending American ground troops to Bosnia. I would like to address that point this morning because, obviously, in the Senate and in the House we are going to begin a debate which could last a couple of weeks here. After there are hearings, after there are briefings, presumably we will be voting on the issue, and I think it is important for us to begin to lay out the various issues, to get response from the American people, to discuss the matter among ourselves, and then be able to make an informed judgment. I would note that in checking this morning I found that since we began keeping track of it in my office, we have received 400 calls against sending American troops to Bosnia and 6 calls in favor. And I spent a fair amount of time during the Thanksgiving recess speaking with groups in Arizona and appearing on various radio programs. In each case, the response was similar to the one which I just indicated. That is not dispositive, but I think it is an important indicator of the fact that the American people do not sense there is a sufficient degree of interest here for the United States to participate. It seems to me there are two basic criteria which need to be satisfied in order to justify the sending of a large number of American ground troops into a situation where, as the President and the Secretary of Defense have both acknowledged, there is certainly a danger of some casualties. The first criterion which has traditionally been applied is that there is a national security interest of the United States at stake. Sometimes it has been expressed as a vital national security interest. The second is more operational. It generally divides into about three subcategories: that there is a very clear and important mission; that the rules of engagement are clear and [[Page S 17542]] agreed to; and that there is a clear exit strategy. Let us talk about both of those in the context of the President's remarks last night. I did not really hear a justification for the first point, that is to say, that there is a vital U.S. national security interest involved here. I heard some talk about the fact that it was important for the United States as a key participant in NATO to be involved in NATO operations, and I also heard that we wanted to prevent conflict from spreading throughout Europe. Both of those have a national security element to them, but neither goes directly to the question of vital U.S. national security interests. If, for example, someone could make the case that war in Europe was about to break out, while American lives may not be directly in jeopardy, I think few of us would deny that vital interests of the United States would be at stake sufficient for us to commit to not only ground troops but other kinds of military operations to try to prevent that. But that case is not made here. The possibility that there will be some additional civil strife in Bosnia does not suggest the conflict is going to engulf Europe. The situation is very different than it was before World War I. The Austro- Hungarian Empire no longer exists. The conditions are simply not the same. So it seems to me a real stretch to say there may be some additional conflict break out, that that would necessarily engulf Europe in war and therefore at this point the United States needs to send these troops in order to conclude that. That is just not a credible argument. As to the argument about NATO, it seems to me that either NATO is a strong alliance or it is not. I believe it is a strong alliance. If the President is suggesting that the difference between NATO continuing to exist as a strong alliance and its complete failure is whether or not 20,000 of the 60,000 ground troops in this operation are U.S. troops, if that is the difference between NATO existing and not existing, then NATO is in much worse shape than I thought it was, and I think, frankly, it just is not true. NATO is strong. And since we are providing a great deal of the support for the existing NATO operation, and will continue to do so under this peace process which has been negotiated, in terms of the seapower that we have projected, the airpower, the reconnaissance, the intelligence, obviously, monetary support that we will be providing and material support and a lot of other things, since we have been doing those things and will continue to do them as part of the NATO operation, it does not seem to me that we are subject to criticism that we are not supporting the NATO operation. It is just a question of whether some of the ground troops are going to be U.S. troops or not. My understanding is that the British and French and perhaps others in NATO insisted that part of the ground contingent be United States troops. That is not a justification for saying that therefore we must go. I would have to ask our allies, why? Why is it that you insist that not only do we pay for most of the operation and that we send our ships and our cargo planes and our jet fighters and reconnaissance planes, and all of the other equipment and personnel that we have in the region, in addition to all of that, a necessary component of this is that 20,000 of the 60,000 ground troops be U.S. troops? Why is that so essential? Is it because the Europeans do not have another 20,000 troops? No. That is not it. It is because they want us to be in the operation on the ground. And my question there is, why? Why is it that that is so essential? If this matter is so important to the Europeans, then it seems to me that they would pull out all of the stops to enforce this peace settlement including providing the necessary ground troops to make it work. And surely among all of the NATO countries there are 60,000 ground troops available. So one has to answer the question I think, why do our Europeans allies insist on this? I cannot think of a satisfactory answer. So back to the first criterion. Is there a vital U.S. national security interest? The answer is no, and the President has not made the case for it. Let me contrast this with the Persian Gulf war because a lot of people have tried to say that, like the Persian Gulf war, we need to follow the lead of the President and accede to his request for ground troops. The Persian Gulf war and this situation, it seems to me, are relatively close cases, both of them, but one falls on the side of supporting the operation and the other falls on the side of not supporting it. And here is why. Let us say on a scale of 1 to 10, vital national security interest being 10, Pearl Harbor created a vital national security interest for the United States to be involved in World War II. No question. That is a 10. The Persian Gulf war was a situation in which most of our oil, a majority of our oil, came from the Persian Gulf. Its supplies were threatened. A foreign country had invaded another country, was occupying it and was threatening to invade other countries. At that point, it was important for the world community to come together and say to this aggressor, ``No. Aggression will not pay. We will remove you from Kuwait, take you back to where you came from. You have got to stop threatening all the people whose oil supplies come from that region.'' That is not the same as Pearl Harbor, but clearly vital U.S. interests were involved. And, in fact, worldwide, countries came together, even other Arab countries came together, in an effort to stop that aggression. And I guess on a scale of 1 to 10, I would say that is a 6 or 7. As I said, that is a much closer call than a Pearl Harbor, but still justified our action. And a majority of our people and the Congress supported President Bush's decision to engage in military operations against Iraq. This case in Bosnia, I submit, falls on the other side of the line, if you want to say five is the middle ground. It seems to me there is only one reason why it rises to the level of maybe a three or four. That is the moral imperative. Now, a moral imperative is not the same thing as a vital national security interest of the United States, but in certain instances it may call upon the United States to do something. That is why the United States has been involved in various humanitarian missions. It is why we went into Somalia with a humanitarian mission to begin with. It is why we were not justified in changing that mission as it later was changed. The United States has done lots of things for a lot of people around the world in a humanitarian way for moral reasons. In addition to the humanitarian support that we provided, we also have supported some military operations in support of the humanitarian effort. But that is different from saying that in addition to air operations and sea operations and humanitarian operations and peacekeeping operations, in addition to all those things the United States must send 20,000 ground troops to keep the peace that has been negotiated at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. So, yes, there is a moral imperative. That is what makes this a relatively hard case. But it does not rise to the level of a vital national security interest. It says that we ought to be doing something. And we are doing something, and we will continue to do more. I submit that the one thing that we should have been doing a long time ago is still missing from this peace agreement, and that is ensuring that Bosnia can defend itself. For a long time many of us in this body have argued for arming the Bosnians, the Bosnian Moslems, so they can defend themselves. We always believed that a rough parity would eventually be created sufficient to cause the Serbs to come to the bargaining table. What happened when Croatia, after about 3 years, was able to build up its military forces sufficient to retake some of the territory that the Serbs had taken from them? At that point, the Serbs became defensive rather than offensive in their military operations. They also came to the bargaining table because they understood that it was a losing game for them, that the longer they persisted, the more territory likely would be taken from them. So a military balance of forces of some sort was, in fact, created. That is what we have sought when we said we needed to lift the arms embargo and support rearming the Bosnian Moslems so they could defend themselves. And [[Page S 17543]] yet that commitment is not part of this particular peace agreement. So it seems to me that the one thing that we could do in this situation we have not done in this particular peace agreement. Turning for a moment from the vital national security interest, let us go to the other part of the equation, the second part. The mission has not been clearly defined. The rules of engagement have not yet been established. And, third, there is no exit strategy. Tony Lake, the National Security Adviser, was quoted in the newspapers yesterday--I think he made the statement Sunday--that our first mission is self- defense. Mr. President, the way you fulfill that mission is by not sending the people in the first place. That is not a mission. That is very muddled thinking to suggest that our first mission there is self-defense. The mission has to be stated much more clearly, and it has not been, nor have the various contingencies been defined. What happens if various kinds of military conflicts break out? We have not decided how we are going to handle those things. And that has to do also with the rules of engagement. They have been only very generally stated up to this point. As my colleague, Senator McCain, has pointed out, what is really glaringly missing is any kind of an exit strategy. A 1-year timetable is not an exit strategy. What is to prevent mission creep, and what is to define success of the mission? Most observers have said for this peacekeeping mission to really succeed, it is going to have to be a commitment of years, perhaps decades. And that gets to the next point, Mr. President. Perhaps the primary justification that the President has given for sending American ground troops to Bosnia is that if we do not do so, the war will reignite and there will be additional suffering. In other words, if you believe in war, you vote no; if you believe in peace, you vote yes. That is a false choice, Mr. President. That is a false choice. If this peace that has been negotiated is so fragile, if it is so fragile that the only thing between peace and war is that of the 60,000 ground troops, and 20,000 have to be Americans, then this is a peace which is bound to fail. It is not a peace of the heart. It is not a peace that has been committed to by the belligerents, but rather a convenience that has probably been forced upon the parties and is probably doomed to, if not failure, at least a very rocky road, which means a lot of casualties on the part of the peacekeepers. And that is a situation we need to take into account before we support the President's decision to send the troops. What is it that makes the 20,000 American ground force contingent sine qua non, to use that Latin phrase, that without which this peace agreement cannot succeed? We are already providing sea power and air power and reconnaissance and intelligence and humanitarian assistance, diplomatic assistance, monetary assistance. The President has committed to some additional monetary assistance. We are already providing a lot of things to promote peace in the region. Our European allies have said we need a ground contingent of 60,000. They are willing to support that with 40,000. What is it that makes the additional 20,000 required to be American troops? Why cannot they be European? Is the President saying that if all 60,000 are European, the agreement will fail? That is what he said in effect. What is the magic of 20,000 of those being American? ``Well, America has prestige, and American prestige is necessary to enforce this agreement.'' American prestige will be demonstrated every time a U.S. fighter jet passes overhead. It will be demonstrated every time you look out to sea and see one of our carriers or destroyers cruising in the Adriatic. It will be present with the diplomatic presence of the United States, the power of the U.S. Presidency and our support for NATO, and demonstrated in 100 ways. What is it that is so magical about one-third of the ground troops being American? Sure, that will demonstrate an additional presence, but is it absolutely essential? It is the difference between war and peace, the President says. If it is--and I doubt that it is--but if it is, then this peace is too fragile, in the first place. We already have signs that that is true with some of the Serb leaders saying in effect, no, never, that blood will be spilled, that they are not going to go along with this. So, if the basic criterion, as the President laid out, was that there would be peace, and we would simply be implementing the peace, one questions whether that condition will even exist when our troops hit the ground over there, if they do. There has been another justification, and I think that this is perhaps one of the most difficult for us to deal with because all of us support, not only the President, but the office of the Presidency. We generally try to defer to the President and the executive branch in foreign policy matters to a large extent, anyway. But the Senate has certain constitutional prerogatives. We have the advice-and-consent prerogative. We have the ability to ratify treaties, and so on. The President, in effect, has invited the Congress to decide whether or not to support his action or not. So I do not think there is any question that we need to make an independent judgment here of whether or not the sending of these troops is a good idea. But the argument of the President in this regard goes something as follows. Up until the time that the agreement in Dayton was initialed, we were not supposed to debate the issue because, after all, there was not anything to debate. We had not decided what to do. Well, the reality was the President had already committed to send the 20,000 troops, but we were not supposed to debate that because the agreement was not clear yet. So we did not. We basically deferred. There were many of us here, myself included, who wanted to speak much more specifically about it, to ask a lot of questions, and perhaps to lay down some conditions for the peace agreement, but we did not do that out of deference to the President. But now the argument goes, once the agreement was initialed, ``You would be pulling the rug out from under the Presidency, indeed from under U.S. foreign policy, if you did not approve my commitment to send 20,000 American troops.'' That is a catch-22, Mr. President. You cannot argue about it before the treaty is initialed and as soon as it is initialed, it is too late to argue about it. So when are we going to have the debate as to whether or not this is good policy? It is true, if the Congress turned its back on the President at this point, there would be some embarrassment to the United States. The question we have to ask ourselves is: Is the risk of casualties and is the precedent which is being set to send these troops outweighed by some temporary embarrassment to the United States? I submit at this point, at least I have concluded that the answer to that is no, that the Congress has to make it clear to the President that he cannot simply go around making premature commitments without the advice and consent of the Congress, commitments which some of us believe not to be wise, and then justifying the support for that on the basis that the commitment was made and, therefore, cannot be questioned anymore. Either you consult with the Congress in advance and have some sense that you have the support of the Congress and the American people and then argue, once the commitment is made, that it is too late to argue about it, or at least I think you have been estopped, to use a legal phrase, to argue there should not be a robust debate about it after the decision has been made. My point is, there is no argument to say, ``I made the commitment to send the troops and now it would be embarrassing to the United States, it would diminish the leadership role of our country if I were not backed up in that commitment,'' to use the President's argument. My point is very simple. The President should have thought of that before he made the commitment. He made a commitment, and I think at this point we have to debate it. The bottom line is this: The President has not demonstrated a vital national security interest of the United States involved, nor has there been a [[Page S 17544]] clear delineation of the operational aspects, its mission, the rules of engagement, and the exit strategy. Until those cases are made, I think the President is asking too much of us to commit U.S. ground troops to this operation. Therefore, Mr. President, it would be my hope that after we have had a full debate, after there have been hearings, after there have been briefings by the administration, and after we have had an opportunity to consider within this body and the House has had an opportunity to consider it, that we would have a vote on the matter; that we be able to express ourselves either to support the President's request or to reject it. At this point, my own view is that we reject it. I invite any debate and any rationale that can be expressed in support of the President's position. As I said, at this point, I think it is far too serious a matter for the United States Congress to support the President's request that 20,000 ground troops be sent to Bosnia, in addition to all the other things which we have already done and which we continue to do. I close with this point. Nobody wants this tragedy to continue. Everybody wants peace to succeed. We all commend the President and those who negotiated on his behalf for this peace agreement, and I would want to do everything we could to support that agreement, short of the commitment of these ground troops. They are not the necessary ingredient to make it work. If they were, it would be destined to fail. Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Vermont.

Mr. President, I wanted to speak this morning in response to President Clinton's address to the Nation last night regarding the sending of American troops to Bosnia. I think the President made a strong case for support for his position, but I do not think that he made a strong enough case to justify sending American ground troops to Bosnia. I would like to address that point this morning because, obviously, in the Senate and in the House we are going to begin a debate which could last a couple of weeks here. After there are hearings, after there are briefings, presumably we will be voting on the issue, and I think it is important for us to begin to lay out the various issues, to get response from the American people, to discuss the matter among ourselves, and then be able to make an informed judgment.

The Persian Gulf war and this situation, it seems to me, are relatively close cases, both of them, but one falls on the side of supporting the operation and the other falls on the side of not supporting it. And here is why. Let us say on a scale of 1 to 10, vital national security interest being 10, Pearl Harbor created a vital national security interest for the United States to be involved in World War II. No question. That is a 10. The Persian Gulf war was a situation in which most of our oil, a majority of our oil, came from the Persian Gulf. Its supplies were threatened. A foreign country had invaded another country, was occupying it and was threatening to invade other countries. At that point, it was important for the world community to come together and say to this aggressor, ``No. Aggression will not pay. We will remove you from Kuwait, take you back to where you came from. You have got to stop threatening all the people whose oil supplies come from that region.'' That is not the same as Pearl Harbor, but clearly vital U.S. interests were involved. And, in fact, worldwide, countries came together, even other Arab countries came together, in an effort to stop that aggression. And I guess on a scale of 1 to 10, I would say that is a 6 or 7. As I said, that is a much closer call than a Pearl Harbor, but still justified our action. And a majority of our people and the Congress supported President Bush's decision to engage in military operations against Iraq. This case in Bosnia, I submit, falls on the other side of the line, if you want to say five is the middle ground. It seems to me there is only one reason why it rises to the level of maybe a three or four. That is the moral imperative. Now, a moral imperative is not the same thing as a vital national security interest of the United States, but in certain instances it may call upon the United States to do something. That is why the United States has been involved in various humanitarian missions. It is why we went into Somalia with a humanitarian mission to begin with. It is why we were not justified in changing that mission as it later was changed. The United States has done lots of things for a lot of people around the world in a humanitarian way for moral reasons. In addition to the humanitarian support that we provided, we also have supported some military operations in support of the humanitarian effort. But that is different from saying that in addition to air operations and sea operations and humanitarian operations and peacekeeping operations, in addition to all those things the United States must send 20,000 ground troops to keep the peace that has been negotiated at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. So, yes, there is a moral imperative. That is what makes this a relatively hard case. But it does not rise to the level of a vital national security interest. It says that we ought to be doing something. And we are doing something, and we will continue to do more. I submit that the one thing that we should have been doing a long time ago is still missing from this peace agreement, and that is ensuring that Bosnia can defend itself.

So I do not think there is any question that we need to make an independent judgment here of whether or not the sending of these troops is a good idea. But the argument of the President in this regard goes something as follows. Up until the time that the agreement in Dayton was initialed, we were not supposed to debate the issue because, after all, there was not anything to debate. We had not decided what to do. Well, the reality was the President had already committed to send the 20,000 troops, but we were not supposed to debate that because the agreement was not clear yet. So we did not. We basically deferred. There were many of us here, myself included, who wanted to speak much more specifically about it, to ask a lot of questions, and perhaps to lay down some conditions for the peace agreement, but we did not do that out of deference to the President. But now the argument goes, once the agreement was initialed, ``You would be pulling the rug out from under the Presidency, indeed from under U.S. foreign policy, if you did not approve my commitment to send 20,000 American troops.'' That is a catch-22, Mr. President. You cannot argue about it before the treaty is initialed and as soon as it is initialed, it is too late to argue about it. So when are we going to have the debate as to whether or not this is good policy? It is true, if the Congress turned its back on the President at this point, there would be some embarrassment to the United States. The question we have to ask ourselves is: Is the risk of casualties and is the precedent which is being set to send these troops outweighed by some temporary embarrassment to the United States? I submit at this point, at least I have concluded that the answer to that is no, that the Congress has to make it clear to the President that he cannot simply go around making premature commitments without the advice and consent of the Congress, commitments which some of us believe not to be wise, and then justifying the support for that on the basis that the commitment was made and, therefore, cannot be questioned anymore. Either you consult with the Congress in advance and have some sense that you have the support of the Congress and the American people and then argue, once the commitment is made, that it is too late to argue about it, or at least I think you have been estopped, to use a legal phrase, to argue there should not be a robust debate about it after the decision has been made. My point is, there is no argument to say, ``I made the commitment to send the troops and now it would be embarrassing to the United States, it would diminish the leadership role of our country if I were not backed up in that commitment,'' to use the President's argument. My point is very simple. The President should have thought of that before he made the commitment. He made a commitment, and I think at this point we have to debate it. The bottom line is this: The President has not demonstrated a vital national security interest of the United States involved, nor has there been a [[Page S 17544]] clear delineation of the operational aspects, its mission, the rules of engagement, and the exit strategy. Until those cases are made, I think the President is asking too much of us to commit U.S. ground troops to this operation. Therefore, Mr. President, it would be my hope that after we have had a full debate, after there have been hearings, after there have been briefings by the administration, and after we have had an opportunity to consider within this body and the House has had an opportunity to consider it, that we would have a vote on the matter; that we be able to express ourselves either to support the President's request or to reject it. At this point, my own view is that we reject it. I invite any debate and any rationale that can be expressed in support of the President's position. As I said, at this point, I think it is far too serious a matter for the United States Congress to support the President's request that 20,000 ground troops be sent to Bosnia, in addition to all the other things which we have already done and which we continue to do. I close with this point. Nobody wants this tragedy to continue. Everybody wants peace to succeed. We all commend the President and those who negotiated on his behalf for this peace agreement, and I would want to do everything we could to support that agreement, short of the commitment of these ground troops. They are not the necessary ingredient to make it work. If they were, it would be destined to fail. Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Vermont. ","['Mr. KYL.', ' Mr. ', 'President, I ', ""wanted to speak this morning in response to President Clinton's address to the Nation last night regarding the sending of American troops to "", 'Bosnia. I ', 'think the President made a strong case for support for his position, but I do not think that he made a strong enough case to justify sending American ground troops to ', 'Bosnia. I ', 'would like to address that point this morning because, obviously, in the Senate and in the House we are going to begin a debate which could last a couple of weeks here. After there are hearings, after there are briefings, presumably we will be voting on the issue, and I think it is important for us to begin to lay out the various issues, to get response from the American people, to discuss the matter among ourselves, and then be able to make an informed judgment. I would note that in checking this morning I found that since we began keeping track of it in my office, we have received 400 calls against sending American troops to Bosnia and 6 calls in favor. ', 'And I ', 'spent a fair amount of time during the Thanksgiving recess speaking with groups in Arizona and appearing on various radio programs. In each case, the response was similar to the one which I just indicated. That is not dispositive, but I think it is an important indicator of the fact that the American people do not sense there is a sufficient degree of interest here for the United States to participate. It seems to me there are two basic criteria which need to be satisfied in order to justify the sending of a large number of American ground troops into a situation where, as the President and the Secretary of Defense have both acknowledged, there is certainly a danger of some casualties. The first criterion which has traditionally been applied is that there is a national security interest of the United States at stake. Sometimes it has been expressed as a vital national security interest. The second is more operational. It generally divides into about three subcategories: that there is a very clear and important mission; that the rules of engagement are clear and [[', 'Page S ', ""17542]] agreed to; and that there is a clear exit strategy. Let us talk about both of those in the context of the President's remarks last night. I did not really hear a justification for the first point, that is to say, that there is a vital U.S. national security interest involved here. I heard some talk about the fact that it was important for the United States as a key participant in "", 'NATO ', 'to be involved in ', 'NATO ', 'operations, and I also heard that we wanted to prevent conflict from spreading throughout Europe. Both of those have a national security element to them, but neither goes directly to the question of vital U.S. national security interests. If, for example, someone could make the case that war in Europe was about to break out, while American lives may not be directly in jeopardy, I think few of us would deny that vital interests of the United States would be at stake sufficient for us to commit to not only ground troops but other kinds of military operations to try to prevent that. But that case is not made here. The possibility that there will be some additional civil strife in Bosnia does not suggest the conflict is going to engulf Europe. The situation is very different than it was before World ', 'War I.', ' The Austro- Hungarian Empire no longer exists. The conditions are simply not the same. So it seems to me a real stretch to say there may be some additional conflict break out, that that would necessarily engulf Europe in war and therefore at this point the United States needs to send these troops in order to conclude that. That is just not a credible argument. As to the argument about ', 'NATO,', ' it seems to me that either ', 'NATO ', 'is a strong alliance or it is not. I believe it is a strong alliance. If the President is suggesting that the difference between ', 'NATO ', 'continuing to exist as a strong alliance and its complete failure is whether or not 20,000 of the 60,000 ground troops in this operation are U.S. troops, if that is the difference between ', 'NATO ', 'existing and not existing, then ', 'NATO ', 'is in much worse shape than I thought it was, and I think, frankly, it just is not true. ', 'NATO ', 'is strong. And since we are providing a great deal of the support for the existing ', 'NATO ', 'operation, and will continue to do so under this peace process which has been negotiated, in terms of the seapower that we have projected, the airpower, the reconnaissance, the intelligence, obviously, monetary support that we will be providing and material support and a lot of other things, since we have been doing those things and will continue to do them as part of the ', 'NATO ', 'operation, it does not seem to me that we are subject to criticism that we are not supporting the ', 'NATO ', 'operation. It is just a question of whether some of the ground troops are going to be U.S. troops or not. My understanding is that the British and French and perhaps others in ', 'NATO ', 'insisted that part of the ground contingent be United States troops. That is not a justification for saying that therefore we must go. I would have to ask our allies, why? Why is it that you insist that not only do we pay for most of the operation and that we send our ships and our cargo planes and our jet fighters and reconnaissance planes, and all of the other equipment and personnel that we have in the region, in addition to all of that, a necessary component of this is that 20,000 of the 60,000 ground troops be U.S. troops? Why is that so essential? Is it because the Europeans do not have another 20,000 troops? No. That is not it. It is because they want us to be in the operation on the ground. And my question there is, why? Why is it that that is so essential? If this matter is so important to the Europeans, then it seems to me that they would pull out all of the stops to enforce this peace settlement including providing the necessary ground troops to make it work. And surely among all of the ', 'NATO ', 'countries there are 60,000 ground troops available. So one has to answer the question I think, why do our Europeans allies insist on this? I cannot think of a satisfactory answer. So back to the first criterion. Is there a vital U.S. national security interest? The answer is no, and the President has not made the case for it. Let me contrast this with the Persian Gulf war because a lot of people have tried to say that, like the Persian Gulf war, we need to follow the lead of the President and accede to his request for ground troops. The Persian Gulf war and this situation, it seems to me, are relatively close cases, both of them, but one falls on the side of supporting the operation and the other falls on the side of not supporting it. And here is why. Let us say on a scale of 1 to 10, vital national security interest being 10, Pearl Harbor created a vital national security interest for the United States to be involved in World ', 'War II.', "" No question. That is a 10. The Persian Gulf war was a situation in which most of our oil, a majority of our oil, came from the Persian Gulf. Its supplies were threatened. A foreign country had invaded another country, was occupying it and was threatening to invade other countries. At that point, it was important for the world community to come together and say to this aggressor, ``No. Aggression will not pay. We will remove you from Kuwait, take you back to where you came from. You have got to stop threatening all the people whose oil supplies come from that region.'' That is not the same as Pearl Harbor, but clearly vital U.S. interests were involved. And, in fact, worldwide, countries came together, even other Arab countries came together, in an effort to stop that aggression. "", 'And I ', 'guess on a scale of 1 to 10, I would say that is a 6 or 7. ', 'As I ', ""said, that is a much closer call than a Pearl Harbor, but still justified our action. And a majority of our people and the Congress supported President Bush's decision to engage in military operations against Iraq. This case in "", 'Bosnia, I ', 'submit, falls on the other side of the line, if you want to say five is the middle ground. It seems to me there is only one reason why it rises to the level of maybe a three or four. That is the moral imperative. Now, a moral imperative is not the same thing as a vital national security interest of the United States, but in certain instances it may call upon the United States to do something. That is why the United States has been involved in various humanitarian missions. It is why we went into Somalia with a humanitarian mission to begin with. It is why we were not justified in changing that mission as it later was changed. The United States has done lots of things for a lot of people around the world in a humanitarian way for moral reasons. In addition to the humanitarian support that we provided, we also have supported some military operations in support of the humanitarian effort. But that is different from saying that in addition to air operations and sea operations and humanitarian operations and peacekeeping operations, in addition to all those things the United States must send 20,000 ground troops to keep the peace that has been negotiated at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. So, yes, there is a moral imperative. That is what makes this a relatively hard case. But it does not rise to the level of a vital national security interest. It says that we ought to be doing something. And we are doing something, and we will continue to do more. I submit that the one thing that we should have been doing a long time ago is still missing from this peace agreement, and that is ensuring that Bosnia can defend itself. For a long time many of us in this body have argued for arming the Bosnians, the Bosnian Moslems, so they can defend themselves. We always believed that a rough parity would eventually be created sufficient to cause the Serbs to come to the bargaining table. What happened when Croatia, after about 3 years, was able to build up its military forces sufficient to retake some of the territory that the Serbs had taken from them? At that point, the Serbs became defensive rather than offensive in their military operations. They also came to the bargaining table because they understood that it was a losing game for them, that the longer they persisted, the more territory likely would be taken from them. So a military balance of forces of some sort was, in fact, created. That is what we have sought when we said we needed to lift the arms embargo and support rearming the Bosnian Moslems so they could defend themselves. And [[', 'Page S ', ""17543]] yet that commitment is not part of this particular peace agreement. So it seems to me that the one thing that we could do in this situation we have not done in this particular peace agreement. Turning for a moment from the vital national security interest, let us go to the other part of the equation, the second part. The mission has not been clearly defined. The rules of engagement have not yet been established. And, third, there is no exit strategy. Tony Lake, the National Security Adviser, was quoted in the newspapers yesterday--I think he made the statement Sunday--that our first mission is self- defense. Mr. President, the way you fulfill that mission is by not sending the people in the first place. That is not a mission. That is very muddled thinking to suggest that our first mission there is self-defense. The mission has to be stated much more clearly, and it has not been, nor have the various contingencies been defined. What happens if various kinds of military conflicts break out? We have not decided how we are going to handle those things. And that has to do also with the rules of engagement. They have been only very generally stated up to this point. As my colleague, Senator McCain, has pointed out, what is really glaringly missing is any kind of an exit strategy. A 1-year timetable is not an exit strategy. What is to prevent mission creep, and what is to define success of the mission? Most observers have said for this peacekeeping mission to really succeed, it is going to have to be a commitment of years, perhaps decades. And that gets to the next point, Mr. President. Perhaps the primary justification that the President has given for sending American ground troops to Bosnia is that if we do not do so, the war will reignite and there will be additional suffering. In other words, if you believe in war, you vote no; if you believe in peace, you vote yes. That is a false choice, Mr. President. That is a false choice. If this peace that has been negotiated is so fragile, if it is so fragile that the only thing between peace and war is that of the 60,000 ground troops, and 20,000 have to be Americans, then this is a peace which is bound to fail. It is not a peace of the heart. It is not a peace that has been committed to by the belligerents, but rather a convenience that has probably been forced upon the parties and is probably doomed to, if not failure, at least a very rocky road, which means a lot of casualties on the part of the peacekeepers. And that is a situation we need to take into account before we support the President's decision to send the troops. What is it that makes the 20,000 American ground force contingent sine qua non, to use that Latin phrase, that without which this peace agreement cannot succeed? We are already providing sea power and air power and reconnaissance and intelligence and humanitarian assistance, diplomatic assistance, monetary assistance. The President has committed to some additional monetary assistance. We are already providing a lot of things to promote peace in the region. Our European allies have said we need a ground contingent of 60,000. They are willing to support that with 40,000. What is it that makes the additional 20,000 required to be American troops? Why cannot they be European? Is the President saying that if all 60,000 are European, the agreement will fail? That is what he said in effect. What is the magic of 20,000 of those being American? ``Well, America has prestige, and American prestige is necessary to enforce this agreement.'' American prestige will be demonstrated every time a U.S. fighter jet passes overhead. It will be demonstrated every time you look out to sea and see one of our carriers or destroyers cruising in the Adriatic. It will be present with the diplomatic presence of the United States, the power of the U.S. Presidency and our support for "", 'NATO,', ' and demonstrated in 100 ways. What is it that is so magical about one-third of the ground troops being American? Sure, that will demonstrate an additional presence, but is it absolutely essential? It is the difference between war and peace, the President says. If it is--and I doubt that it is--but if it is, then this peace is too fragile, in the first place. We already have signs that that is true with some of the Serb leaders saying in effect, no, never, that blood will be spilled, that they are not going to go along with this. So, if the basic criterion, as the President laid out, was that there would be peace, and we would simply be implementing the peace, one questions whether that condition will even exist when our troops hit the ground over there, if they do. There has been another justification, and I think that this is perhaps one of the most difficult for us to deal with because all of us support, not only the President, but the office of the Presidency. We generally try to defer to the President and the executive branch in foreign policy matters to a large extent, anyway. But the Senate has certain constitutional prerogatives. We have the advice-and-consent prerogative. We have the ability to ratify treaties, and so on. The President, in effect, has invited the Congress to decide whether or not to support his action or not. ', 'So I ', ""do not think there is any question that we need to make an independent judgment here of whether or not the sending of these troops is a good idea.

66,"DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996 The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill. Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the pending amendment aside. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 2840 (Purpose: To provide funding for the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration for implementing certain recommendations and for carrying out a transition) Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan], for himself, Mr. Burns, Mr. Hollings, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Graham, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Reid, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Thurmond, proposes an amendment numbered 2840. Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: At the appropriate place, insert the following: United States Travel and Tourism Administration salaries and expenses For necessary expenses of the United States Travel and Tourism Administration, for implementing the recommendations from the White House Conference on Travel and Tourism and for carrying out the transition of that Administration into a public-private partnership, $12,000,000, to be transferred from the amount for deposit in the Commerce Reorganization Transition Fund (established under section 206(c)(1) of this title) that is made available in the item under the heading ``commerce reorganization transition fund'' under the heading ``General Administration'' under this title, notwithstanding any other provision of law. Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to report the floor manager has indicated that this amendment will be accepted. I want to acknowledge the support of the distinguished Senator from Montana, who has been most helpful in working through this amendment. I yield the floor, if I may, to him. I made remarks earlier this morning. This deals with the USTTA. The distinguished floor managers have accommodated that. I yield to the Senator from Montana. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana. Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nevada. I do not think there is anybody on the Commerce Committee who is any more dedicated to the health of the industry we call tourism. If the American people would look around, this happens to be one part of the Commerce Department that produces an export that is $20 billion to this country in the black--not in the red. In fact, if it was not for agriculture and tourism, our balance of payments would look really bad. But when any industry produces around $77 billion in foreign exchange earnings every year, we have to take note, especially since this country probably makes less investment in this part of our national economy than any other part. Mr. President, 7.7 million people visited our State of Montana. Sometimes [[Page S 14631]] we think we are pretty authentic, but I also understand where the Senator from Nevada is coming from, too, because they have a very active tourism part of their State government and he has been supportive of that. If this amendment is accepted, it is only an increase of around $5 million, because there is already $7 million of transition funds in there. Also, the plans and preparations are being made to privatize this department because the tourism industry wants to put together the funds. They think they can do a better job in establishing this commission than the Government can, and we agree with them. But let us give them the time, some funds, and a transition period and let them do it. Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as a former Governor of Florida, where the tourism industry is the State's largest employer, I am amazed at the fact that an industry with such tremendous economic impact can continually be so under-appreciated and misunderstood. Travel and tourism is the second largest industry in the United States behind health care, employing more than 13 million Americans both directly and indirectly. Last year, foreign spending on U.S. travel accounted for 39 percent of all service exports and 9 percent of total U.S. exports resulting in a $22 billion trade surplus. The work of the administration gives our country international presence. USTTA plays an important role in helping States and the private sector to develop its international travel market, a part of a coordinated national marketing and economic strategy. State governments and private industry depend on USTTA research to assist them in marketing activities and spending decisions. In Florida, tourism represents a $33 billion a year industry, employing 750,000 residents. International visitors, who make up 20 percent of Florida tourists, also have a regional impact. Often, tourists first visiting the United States will travel to Florida or California. On subsequent visits, however, statistics show they are likely to travel throughout the region or the country. Yet while we are debating this issue today it is imporant to note that the National Governors Association at their 1995 summer meeting, adopted a resolution supporting the USTTA and their proposal to transition the agency into a public private partnership at the end of fiscal year 1996. The resolution states: The Governors believe that a strong public private partnership is essential to promote tourism abroad and increase visitation to the United States. The Governors also believe that in a number of areas, the federal government bears responsibility for functions that can ensure benefits for state and national economies and international visitors. This resolution like the Bryan-Burns amendment has bipartisan support because in the final analysis international tourism promotion is an investment in economic development and job creation. The United States cannot afford to be the only one of 157 developed nations without an official National Tourism Office. Additionally, the first ever White House Conference on Travel and Tourism will bring together the recommendations of over 15,000 travel and tourism representatives from the 55 States and territories. One of the key recommendations to be announced is the strong support for a national tourism office that will serve as a catalyst for implementing a national tourism strategy for the 21st century. Please join me in supporting the Bryan-Burns amendment which provides one additional year of funding at the $12 million level to allow the agency to transition itself in a businesslike and professional manner while implementing the recommendations of the first ever White House Conference of Travel and Tourism. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think we have worked out a good agreement here. We have decided in the committee to terminate this agency. Our dear colleagues asked for a provision that would allow them to phase it out over a year's period with a definite commitment that at the end of the year it is gone, with a transition into a private partnership program. I think it is an excellent amendment. I am happy to accept it. I know Senator Hollings feels the same way, so we are happy to accept this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? The Senator from Nevada. Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I acknowledge publicly my appreciation for the response of the Senator from Texas. I ask unanimous consent the junior Senator from California, Senator Boxer, be listed as a cosponsor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the amendment. The amendment (No. 2840) was agreed to. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote. Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Amendment No. 2841 (Purpose: To protect the reproductive rights of Federal women prisoners) Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the pending amendment is set aside. The clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Snowe, and Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 2841. The amendment is as follows: On page 34, strike lines 1 through 7. Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair. Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield to my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire on the condition I do not lose my right to the floor. Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I seek to propound a unanimous consent request at this time that I will present a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to this amendment that is pending, there will be 20 minutes of debate equally divided, that there will be a vote at 6 o'clock on the sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I ask unanimous consent that be agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, I am prepared to accede to the vote at 6 o'clock providing there is a consent to my amendment which I discussed with the manager. Mr. GRAMM. Which is this? Mr. SPECTER. This is the amendment to strike the language which prohibits the expenditure of funds to pay for abortion for a woman in prison. Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader. Mr. DASCHLE. I will not object with the understanding it has been cleared on our side. Is that the understanding of the Senator from Pennsylvania? Mr. SPECTER. No; it has not been cleared on that side. Mr. DASCHLE. Then we have to object until I have had the opportunity to consult with our manager. Mr. SPECTER. I object to the interruption of the pendency of the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the amendment which I have sent to the desk--I had not sought clearance from Senator Hollings because Senator Gramm objected to it so there was no point in seeking clearance. But the amendment provides we strike lines 1 through 7 on page 34. The amendment would strike the following language: None of the funds appropriated by this title shall be available to pay for abortion except where the life of the mother would be in danger if the fetus were carried to term, or in the case of rape, provided that should this prohibition be declared unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this section shall be null and void. Mr. President, the law at the present time is that a woman in prison may obtain an abortion under circumstances where the prison authorities think it is appropriate to do so. The use of this procedure has been very, very limited. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order. Mr. SPECTER. The procedures have been used on a very limited basis. [[Page S 14632]] From April of 1995 through July 18, only nine abortions were performed on Federal women prisoners. The restrictions on the ban were lifted in late 1993, but when language was not included in the appropriation bill, the Bureau took more than 1 year to reestablish procedures for funding abortion services. In 1994, I am advised that there were 73 live births to Federal prisoners. In 1995 there have been 21 births. The Bureau of Prisons advises that there are nearly 7,000 women incarcerated for Federal crimes, and about 70 percent of those are there on drug offenses. The situation would exist, if this language were to become law, the language which I seek to strike, that women in prison who have a serious medical need would be denied an abortion. They obviously are not in the position to pay for their own abortions when they are in jail and unable to earn any money. By way of background, in 1995, an amendment was offered to prohibit funding to the Federal prison system for abortions on pregnant inmates except when the life of the mother was in danger. A tabling motion failed on a 46 to 46 vote. Then the amendment was defeated on a constitutional point of order--may we have order, Mr. President? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. The amendment was then defeated on a constitutional point of order 47 to 48, that prisoners are legally entitled to adequate medical care when there exists a serious medical need. The thrust of this amendment would place women in prison in a very disadvantaged position, and it is my view this language ought to be stricken. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the amendment offered by the distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania. The amendment would strike from the bill before us the provision which prohibits Federal funds from being used for abortion services for women in Federal prison. But, let me be clear. The amendment would leave intact language in the bill which provides a conscience clause for those opposed to abortion. That language, which this amendment does not touch, ensures that no person would be required to perform, or facilitate in any way the performance of, any abortion. Let me tell you why I believe this amendment must be adopted. The provision contained in the committee-passed bill is part of a wideranging assault on women's reproductive rights. Mr. President, it is going to be a long autumn for America's women. Let us look at what has happened already. The Senate has voted to deny women who are Federal employees coverage under their health plans for abortion services. A Senate/House conference committee has voted to ban abortions for women in the military stationed overseas. The House has voted to let States deny Medicaid abortions for victims of rape and incest. The House version of the D.C. appropriations bill would tell the District of Columbia that it can not use its own, locally raised, revenues for abortions for poor women. Legislation to ban certain late term abortions, even when severe fetal abnormalities are present or the woman's life or health is at serious risk, is under consideration in both the House and Senate. And now, under the bill before us, no abortions for women in Federal prisons. Action after action, vote after vote, we have seen yet another attack on women's reproductive rights. We are facing a full scale assault on women's constitutionally protected right to choose. Those who oppose reproductive rights know better than to launch a direct attack. The public strongly supports the right to choose, and the antichoice forces know it. So, instead they chip away at the right, hoping perhaps that no one will notice that yet another group of women have lost their rights. The bill before us today picks upon a particularly vulnerable population. Women in prison. Women who are totally dependent on health care services provided by the Bureau of Prisons. Let us be honest. There is no significant Federal expense involved in providing abortions for women in Federal prisons. Only nine women have obtained abortions since earlier prohibitions were repealed in 1993. So this is of no real consequence to the Federal budget. Yet, it is a huge issue for the few women who do find themselves in this desperate circumstance. These are not women who have the resources to ever afford private medical services. So by including this provision in this bill we are voting to deny these women access to a legal medical procedure. And who are these women? Over two thirds of the women in Federal prisons are drug offenders. Many of them are in poor health, perhaps HIV-infected, or suffering from AIDS--with all the risks this entails for a developing fetus. Many are themselves victims of abuse. To add to all this, if these women are forced to carry a child to term, they face the certainty that the child will be taken from them. How can we force women facing these circumstances to bear children against their will? To deny these women the right to make their own decision on abortion--a decision carefully arrived at after consultation with a physician and appropriate counseling--is unconscionable. The provision included in this bill is bad policy. It is one more attack on women's reproductive rights. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the amendment offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania. in opposition to back-door approach to undermining the constitutional right to an abortion Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to sections 103 to 105 of the Commerce Justice State appropriations bill. These sections would further undermine the constitutional right to an abortion. The right to an abortion was first articulated by the Supreme Court in the 1973 Roe versus Wade decision. This decision balanced the interests of protecting the fetus with the important interests of the mother, establishing a trimester system under which the right to choice in this country was delineated. Subsequent decisions have held that the Government may not place an undue burden on the woman's right, prior to fetal viability, to make a decision whether or not to have an abortion. There is no right to choose without access to choice. Restricting women's choice on these appropriations bills, and on other unrelated legislation, is a circumspect, back-door approach to prohibiting abortions. For women who cannot afford an abortion on their own, for poor women, this back-door approach to limiting abortions is just one more step to a back alley abortion. The many efforts to undercut the constitutional right to an abortion in this Congress, and earlier Congresses, have been documented by the National Abortion Rights Action League in their publication, ``The Road to the Back Alley.'' I recommend that interested individuals consult this publication. Efforts to undercut a woman's right to choose have included: Blanket restrictions on Federal funding for abortions. As an alternative to unsuccessful congressional efforts to prohibit abortion outright, abortion opponents have worked to ban the use of Federal funds to pay for abortions. These restrictions, popularly referred to as ``Hyde amendments,'' have been attached to appropriations bills ever since Roe Versus Wade. The most recent of such measures was Representative Istook's amendment to give States the option of not providing funds to Medicaid recipients in cases of rape and incest. Banning U.S. aid to international family planning groups performing abortions or abortion counseling. In June, the House approved an amendment to a foreign affairs bill that would ban U.S. aid to any international organizations that perform abortions, counsel women on abortions, or lobby on abortion issues. Prohibiting health insurance companies from paying for abortions for Federal employees. On July 19, the House approved reinstatement of legislation [[Page S 14633]] prohibiting the Federal Employees Health Insurance Program from paying for abortions, except when a woman's life is in danger. The Senate approved similar language on August 4, with exceptions for rape and incest. Barring abortions at military hospitals, even when paid for privately. On June 16, the House voted to restore a ban President Clinton had lifted against privately funded abortions in overseas military hospitals. Prohibiting certain types of late-term abortions. On July 18, the House Judiciary Committee reported legislation that would make it a crime for doctors to perform a late-term abortion procedure called intact D&E. This procedure is extremely rare, and almost exclusively limited to cases in which tragic fetal deformities have been detected. This is only a partial list of the back-door assaults on a woman's right to choose. The proposed language is just one more step in the long line of rollbacks on women's reproductive freedoms. I urge my colleagues to strike this language from the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this is House language in the bill. The House language is very clear. We are talking about taxpayers' money. Both the House and the Senate have taken the position that when the taxpayers' money is being spent to fund abortions, that abortion should be restricted, that it ought to be restricted to rape, to incest, and to the life of the mother. What the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania will do by striking the Hyde language from this bill is to basically give taxpayer funding for abortion on demand. I do not believe that the House or the Senate supports that action, and I am opposed to it. Let me see if any of my colleagues want to speak on the issue. If not, we will have a motion to table. Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to make another attempt at propounding this unanimous consent. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the debate and disposal---- Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, may we have order? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Will Senators and staff please take their conversations to the cloakrooms? The Senator from New Hampshire may proceed. Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of debate on the present Specter amendment, that my sense-of-the-Senate proposal--which would be to the underlying bill which will be offered and not be subject to a second degree--would be debated for 20 minutes, with 10 minutes on both sides, and that there would then be a sequence of votes should there be a vote ordered on the Specter amendment. If there is not a vote ordered on the Specter amendment, then there would be just a vote that would occur on my sense-of-the-Senate amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will agree to that time agreement, and I think 10 minutes on each side is adequate. I will only modify it with the one additional request, that the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, be recognized to offer the next amendment following the disposition of the Specter amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, I want to be sure I understand this. At the conclusion of the debate on this amendment, then the Gregg amendment would follow, and there would be back-to-back votes on my amendment and the amendment by the Senator from New Hampshire. Mr. GREGG. There would be 20 minutes of debate on my sense of the Senate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, is there an understanding as to how long we will be debating the Specter amendment? Could we get a time agreement on that? Mr. GRAMM. It is our intention to move to table the amendment now. Mr. SMITH. Will the Senator yield? I say to the minority leader, I have no intention to debate. I am prepared to move to table. But I do not want to cut the debate off if there are others who wish to speak. At this time, if it is appropriate, I move to table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent offered by the Senator from New Hampshire, as modified by the Democratic leader? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I move to table the Specter amendment. Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from New Hampshire hold off on that for a brief reply to what the Senator from Texas had to say? Mr. SMITH. Yes. I withhold. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, by way of a very brief reply, the language in this bill is even more restrictive than the Hyde amendment. As the Senator from Texas has propounded, the language of the Hyde amendment limits abortion except for rape, incest, or the life of the mother, and that amendment does not even permit an abortion in the event of incest. Rather, the current language of the bill does not permit abortion even in the event of incest. The language is that none of the funds appropriated by this title--in prison, my colleague from Texas says. But a prisoner can be impregnated as a result of incest before coming to prison. This language is even more restrictive than the Hyde language. This language says that none of the funds appropriated by this title shall be available for an abortion except for the life of the mother---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold, the Senate will please come to order. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. SPECTER. Except when the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term, or in the case of rape. It is entirely possible that a woman might be the victim of incest prior to the time she is incarcerated. It still takes 9 months from the time of impregnation to give birth to a child. Incest is a distinct possibility within that time limit. Contrary to what the Senator from Texas has said, this is not a matter of abortion on demand. This is a matter of abortion when the prison authorities permit the abortion to be carried out. It is not a matter that a woman can simply demand it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senate please come to order? Mr. SPECTER. And if there is a case of serious medical need, a woman ought to be entitled to have an abortion. These women are in prison. They are obviously not able in most cases--in many cases--to earn enough money to have an abortion. When the matter is left within the discretion of the prison officials considering all the circumstances, it has been used on a very, very limited basis, with the statistics showing that only seven abortions were conducted in a period of several months since they were begun in April 1995 through mid-July. I think this is a very reasonable position leaving the decision in the hands of the prison authorities, and I urge adoption of the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, if no one seeks recognition for further debate, I move to table the Specter amendment. Mr. FORD. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New Hampshire is recognized for 10 minutes. Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair. Amendment No. 2842 Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg) proposes an amendment numbered 2842. Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. [[Page S 14634]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: At the appropriate place insert the following: It is the sense of the Senate that none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available pursuant to this act should be used for the deployment of combat-equipped forces of the Armed Forces of the United States for any ground operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina unless-- (1) Congress approves in advance the deployment of such forces of the Armed Forces; or (2) the temporary deployment of such forces of the Armed Forces of the United States into Bosnia and Herzegovina is necessary to evacuate United Nations peacekeeping forces from a situation of imminent danger, to undertake emergency air rescue operations, or to provide for the airborne delivery of humanitarian supplies, and the President reports as soon as practicable to Congress after the initiation of the temporary deployment, but in no case later than 48 hours after the initiation of the deployment. Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the amendment which I proposed originally I had planned to offer as to the continuing resolution, as an act versus a sense-of-the-Senate, but in an attempt to accommodate my colleagues-- -- Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, may we have order? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is correct. Staff and Members will please take their conversations to the Cloakroom. Mr. GREGG. To accommodate my colleagues---- Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. I cannot hear the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is correct. The Senators to the left of the Chair, please take their conversations to the Cloakroom. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his courtesy. Mr. President, in an attempt to accommodate my colleagues, who I understand wish to move on to other business but who I also think desire to speak on this issue in some manner before we break for a week, I have made this---- Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I may say, there are conversations on the floor of the U.S. Senate when the Senator is trying to speak about a very crucial issue that is a matter of life and death, and I urge, if the Chair could, the Chair to be even stronger than he has been to get some order because it is hard for me to hear sitting right across from the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is attempting to be strong. I hope the Senators will be strong in holding forth their conversations elsewhere. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair for his strength. The purpose of this amendment is to raise the issue of how this legislative body should address the pending potential introduction of troops into Bosnia, American troops. The administration has stated on a number of occasions that it is a distinct possibility that up to 25,000 American soldiers will be asked to serve on the ground in Bosnia. That, of course, creates a significant issue first for those soldiers who would be putting their lives at risk but also for us as a country as to whether or not it is appropriate for us to be asking our men and women to put at risk their lives in this conflict. It seems, when there has been such a clear statement of purpose and potential risk for American troops, it is appropriate that we as a Congress act to either approve that action or disapprove that action. Clearly, the power to undertake actions which put American soldiers' lives in harm's way lies primarily and first with the President, but obviously we as a Congress also play a major role, not only on the appropriating side but, more importantly, on the side of being concerned for our soldiers, many of whom will obviously be our constituents. Therefore, I feel strongly that prior to the President taking this action, he should come to the Congress and ask for our approval. I believe he should meet three tests before we give him that approval. First, he should be able to define what it is that the soldiers will be asked to undertake, what the conflict is that we will be entering and what our role is in that conflict. Second, he should be able to explain to us the length of time and the manner in which they are going to serve when they are on the ground and what sort of risks they will be put at. And, third he needs to be able to express to us how we will be getting our soldiers out. I think it is very important that he define in this process what our national interest is in putting American lives at risk. That is the bottom line, I believe, that he must satisfy as President. In addressing that issue, the appropriate body to address it to, obviously, is the American people but also the Congress of the United States as the representative of the American people. Therefore, I do feel it is absolutely critical that before troops are deployed in this region, especially in the numbers which are being considered by the administration--25,000--we have a full and open debate of the matter here in the Congress and that we get from the President a clear and precise and understandable definition of purpose in undertaking this very serious act. So this sense-of-the-Senate resolution essentially addresses that issue. It says that the President shall come to the Congress before he sends troops into harm's way in Bosnia except in certain limited circumstances. The language which I have agreed to is actually language which I originally drafted and then presented to the other side, which was reviewed, and to which they made some adjustments, and I understand it is now acceptable to the Democratic leader. As such, I hope we could have strong support of this because it is clearly the role of the Congress to undertake this sort of debate and pursue this sort of action before our troops are deployed in this type of situation. I reserve the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who controls time in opposition to the amendment? Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I believe I am in control. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia. Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, could I be notified after 4 minutes? Mr. President, I agree with this amendment expressing the sense of the Senate that none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available pursuant to this act shall be used for deployment of combat equipped forces of the Armed Forces of the United States for any ground operations in Bosnia unless, and then the two conditions as set forth: Congress approves in advance deployment of such forces of the Armed Forces and the temporary deployment authority. Mr. President, this amendment does not have the effect of law and does not tie the President's hands. It does state the sentiment and view of the Senate of the United States. If it did tie the President's hands at this critical juncture while the peace negotiations are underway, I would oppose it and vote against it. We should not tie the hands of the President at this critical juncture. If the word went out that there was going to be no U.S. participation after a peace agreement is entered into, then there likely would be no peace agreement entered into by the parties. Mr. President, America must lead. We have seen what happens when we do not lead. We have recently seen what happens when we do lead. Our leadership must be in NATO and through NATO. Our objections to deployment, if there are objections to deployment, of troops by the United States should also be applicable to NATO troops because we are part of that alliance. It is not just the United States we are concerned about. It is also our allies and the alliance itself. Our conditions for deployment should be made known through NATO and that forum. Before any decision is made to deploy U.S. forces or in my view NATO forces pursuant to a peace agreement, we should ask a number of questions, a very difficult set of questions, a very important set of questions regarding that deployment. The first question that I would have--and there would probably be others that would occur to me as time goes on--are the borders between the various factions under the peace agreement both definable and defendable? Is [[Page S 14635]] this a sound peace agreement? If we are deploying pursuant to a peace agreement, the key question is, what kind of peace agreement? Is it a sound peace agreement? Does it have a reasonable chance of success? And can U.S. forces and NATO forces enhance the prospects of success? The second question I would have: Has the President clearly made the case to the American people that the deployment of U.S. ground forces is important to America's national security? That case must be made. The American people must understand this. They must support it. That is a condition that has to be fulfilled if we are going to have a sustainable position if things get rough in Bosnia. And they could get rough--no one should be mistaken about that--although the risk has gone down substantially compared to a month ago when the lines were not as clear as they have been since the recent ground action. Mr. President, the concern I have would not be simply the rights of the Bosnian Moslems versus the Bosnian Serbs but also the rights of the Bosnian Moslems vis-a-vis the Croatian-Bosnians, if that kind of federation breaks up. And it is very important that federation not break up. Another question, Mr. President, that I think has to be discussed by our executive branch and by Congress, do we have an exit strategy? By that I mean, do we know when the mission will be successful, when it will end and how we define success? That involves at least deciding in advance with our allies whether we are going to arm the Bosnian Moslems before we exit--before we exit--or whether we are going to find another way to level the playing field so that the parties can defend their own territory including the possibility of a build down. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 4 minutes. Mr. NUNN. I yield myself 1 more minute, Mr. President. Mr. President, the other question that occurs to me at this moment is whether NATO is clearly going to be in charge. NATO must be in charge. There must be no dual key. We cannot have a repeat of what we have had in the last 2 years with the United Nations having the dual key. I believe it is also imperative, if we are going to deploy NATO forces and U.S. forces, that we deploy a robust force, a force that is big enough and tough enough and well enough equipped not to be pushed around and to defend itself in the event of any kind of conflict. There must be clear rules of engagement. And those rules of engagement must permit a very vigorous response to any attack on U.S. forces or NATO forces. Mr. President, these are just a few of the questions that I believe are important. I reserve the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Lieberman and Senator Domenici as cosponsors. I yield 2 minutes to Senator Specter. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SPECTER. I support this sense-of-the-Senate resolution because I think it is indispensable that advance approval be given by Congress before U.S. troops are deployed, absent the emergency situation described in subparagraph 2. When the distinguished Senator from Georgia talks about impeding the ultimate peace agreement, it seems to me that we ought to put everyone on notice that congressional approval is required before there will be a commitment of 25,000 U.S. personnel. What we are really involved in in modern times is that the constitutional authority of the Congress to declare war has been undermined by the conflict in Korea, which was really a war without a congressional declaration, and by the Vietnam war, which was really a conflict there without a congressional declaration, the Gulf of Tonkin resolution not really being a substitute. There was very serious debate on the floor of this body in January of 1991 when the use of force was authorized. I took the position, as did many Senators, that the President, a Republican President, George Bush, did not have the authority to go into the gulf war without congressional authorization. The questions which have been posed by the Senator from Georgia are very important questions for congressional debate. We should not have a decision made to obligate U.S. personnel without congressional authority. And everyone who is a party to the negotiations there ought to understand that that is the position of the Congress. Without support from the American people, the military action cannot be sustained. That support is determined by the action of the Congress of the United States. So this is a very important resolution to put everyone on notice, including the President of the United States. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields time? Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator from Georgia yield me 1 minute? Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia. Mr. NUNN. I yield the Senator from Michigan 1 minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 1 minute. Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator and I thank the Chair. I wonder if the Senator would be willing to answer a question relative to his understanding of this resolution. I, first of all, think he laid out a series of very important questions, and I concur that those are critical questions that need to be answered prior to the use of ground forces in Bosnia. But my question of the Senator is this: He pointed out this is not legally binding because it is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. If this same language at a later time were offered without the words that it is a ``sense of the Senate'' so that it did then become a legally binding document or language, would it be consistent for those of us who might vote yes today to vote no at a later time because of the timing of the offer of that language or for any other of a number of possible reasons? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator yield me 30 additional seconds? Mr. NUNN. I yield myself 30 seconds. I will respond to the Senator from Michigan that his question should be answered, yes, it would be consistent. There is a great deal of difference in expressing to the President what the view of the Senate is and then passing a law that binds the President, particularly when this kind of negotiation is going on. So it would be consistent. Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. GREGG. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized for 2 minutes. Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I went to the White House today and met with the President and Members of the Senate on this particular subject. I took the occasion at that time to make three points: First, the American public needs to fully and completely understand what U.S. national security interests are at stake before the United States commits or sends United States service men and women to Bosnia. Next, the President of the United States should not commit or send U.S. troops without congressional approval. Now, if that congressional approval is given--this is the third point--any U.S. forces will have to be under the NATO operational control with robust rules of engagement. And I feel that this is such a serious situation, that these three points should be observed in considering this important matter. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire also for working out language with us. This is precisely the same thing we have already voted on in the Senate by 99 to 1. We basically already approved this language. It is a variation in the language here today. But it is the same principle. And the principle is very simple; that if we are going to engage in a large-scale peacekeeping effort, the country is better off and the President [[Page S 14636]] is better off with approval from Congress. I think it is very important to note that the meeting that the Senator from South Carolina just talked about today was attended broadly by House and Senate Members, bipartisan leadership. The President made it very clear, saying that he thought President Bush did the right thing in coming to Congress to ask for approval. He thought the Congress did the right thing in giving it. But we should remember that President Bush sent 500,000 troops to the gulf prior to any approval from Congress. All he had was a sense-of-the-Senate resolution saying this was OK after the fact. The President appropriately has reserved the right with respect to constitutional power not to make a commitment. And we should not hold him to that. So I think it is entirely appropriate here today to say that a sense of the Senate should have unanimous approval. But if this were a law tying the hands of the President, I think many Members on the other side would also join us in disapproving it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. NUNN. I reserve the remainder of my time. How much time do I have remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 55 seconds. Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, of that time, I yield to the Senator from Illinois 1 minute and I yield to the Senator from Connecticut 55 seconds. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 1 minute. Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I agree with everything the Senator from Georgia had to say. I reach a different conclusion. And I may be the only one voting against this. Tom Friedman of the New York Times had a column recently in which he said, ``France acts like a great power but does not have the resources. The United States has the resources but does not act like a great power.'' We cannot have effective foreign policy if Congress micromanages it. The Senator from Georgia asks a series of questions. I think there is one other question. Does it help peace in Bosnia to adopt this resolution? I think it unnecessarily raises questions, and I am going to vote against the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for the remaining time. Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment. I am privileged to be a cosponsor of it because I think it ought to be the beginning of bipartisan cooperation on this question of authorizing American troops to be part of a peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. The fact is that this amendment is consistent with what President Clinton has said. He has clearly said he expects and would welcome congressional action prior to any dispatch of American troops to Bosnia to enforce a genuine and just peace agreement. Mr. President, I want to make very clear that I view the exercise of American leadership to bring about the NATO strikes which have brought Bosnia now to the verge of peace as an exercise of leadership which has revived NATO's credibility. There is no way, if there is a peace agreement, that we can maintain our credibility and NATO's if we do not contribute American troops to that peacekeeping force. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. Mr. GREGG. How much time do I have remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 2 minutes 40 seconds. Mr. GREGG. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Maine. Mr. COHEN. Let me take a moment to challenge the notion that somehow the U.S. Senate is engaged in micromanagement. We are talking about the President of the United States, who is considering deploying 25,000 troops to one of the most hostile regions in the world, that has been filled for centuries with ethnic hatred, poison and death. And we are talking about deploying those troops to that region without having any sort of defined plan presented to us, without knowing what the ground rules are going to be, so to speak, without knowing who is in charge, without knowing what the Russian role is going to be. If ever there was a case in which we ought to be consulted and give approval, it is this one. Let me also take issue with those who said, ``Well, President Bush finally came to Congress.'' It was only after we insisted day in and day out and by going down to the White House, that the President finally agreed to come to Congress to get authority. Before that President Bush was determined to say, ``I only have to get authority from the United Nations, that's where I get my authority.'' We resisted that, and we actually forced the administration to come to us. Not only was it politically wise for him to do so, but we believe he was constitutionally mandated to do so. So the notion that somehow we are micromanaging is misconceived. We are the ones who raise and support the Army, and we have a coequal responsibility, not just the President, if we start deploying 25,000 troops to a region that has been afflicted over the centuries with hatred and conflict. Mr. President, I support the Senator's resolution. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 40 seconds remaining. Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this resolution lays down the ground rules for any major American involvement in Bosnia, and essentially they are: The President must explain to this Congress and the American people what the national interest is which justifies putting American lives at risk, and must receive the approval of this Congress before those lives are put at risk. That is a reasonable request in a democracy, and I appreciate the support of the Members of the Senate in this matter. Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The majority leader. Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I will use 2 minutes of my leader's time to comment on the pending matter. We had a good meeting with the President this afternoon. Many of us were there, Republicans and Democrats. I think he understands the administration needs to present their case to Congress. I asked three questions, very short questions: How many? How long? And how much? How many American troops, men and women are going to go to Bosnia? How long are they going to be there? And how much will it cost? That is the first thing the American people want to know. I believe we are making progress in that part of the world because of the bipartisan efforts of Members of Congress who have stood firm in support of a small nation, an independent nation, a member of the United Nations, Bosnia and Herzegovina. That plus the Croatian military action a couple of months ago, in my view, moved us along, plus the negotiating efforts by the administration. So I think everybody can take some credit. But the case has not been made to this point. It may be made, perhaps it will be made. The view I had from the President, without quoting anything he said, is that he certainly understood that they would have to come up and make their case. They are going to ask for money, and I think they will go before the Foreign Relations Committee, maybe the Armed Services Committee and maybe make an excellent case. I know how bitter some of the debate was during the gulf crisis, and I know many in this body said we ought to have sanctions, that sanctions would work. We still have sanctions, and Saddam Hussein is still there. It has been years and years, so that was not the right way to go. In any event, I hope that we will do what we should do. We are talking about American lives, American young men and women, and we do need to make a very careful judgment, and I think this sends a strong signal that we will make that careful judgment. I thank my colleague. Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. [[Page S 14637]] Mr. EXON addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska. Mr. EXON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be granted 1 minute for debate before the vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. EXON. Madam President, I wish to congratulate the majority leader for the remarks he just made. I thought it was an excellent meeting at the White House today. I will simply say that I think the President unquestionably has agreed to consult with the Congress. I believe that commitment was made again today. This is a very critical time. I hope and believe that adoption of this measure is meaningless, but I hope and think at this particular time we could do no good by adopting this once again, but, obviously, it will be adopted. I will oppose it because I think it is ill-timed for us to be stepping into this matter once again at this particular juncture. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter the President sent to me on October 20, 1993. Let me read one paragraph: I also have made clear that it would be helpful to have a strong expression of support of the United States Congress prior to the participation of U.S. forces in implementation of a Bosnian peace accord. For that reason, I would welcome and encourage congressional authorization of any military involvement in Bosnia. There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: The White House, Washington, DC, October 20, 1993. Hon. Robert Dole, United States Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Leader: The violent conflict in the former Yugoslavia continues to be a source of deep concern. As you know, my Administration is committed to help stop the bloodshed and implement a fair and enforceable peace agreement, if the parties to the conflict can reach one. I have stated that such enforcement potentially could include American military personnel as part of a NATO operation. I have also specified a number of conditions that would need to be met before our troops would participate in such an operation. I also have made clear that it would be helpful to have a strong expression of support from the United States Congress prior to the participation of U.S. forces in implementation of a Bosnian peace accord. For that reason, I would welcome and encourage congressional authorization of any military involvement in Bosnia. The conflict in Bosnia ultimately is a matter for the parties to resolve, but the nations of Europe and the United States have significant interests at stake. For that reason, I am committed to keep our nation engaged in the search for a fair and workable resolution to this tragic conflict. In closing, I want to express my sincere appreciation and respect for the manner in which we have been able to work together on important issues affecting national security. Over the years, the greatest successes in American foreign policy have had bipartisan support. I am gratified that we have been able to sustain that tradition and thank you for your leadership in that regard. Sincerely, Bill Clinton ",https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/9/29/senate-section/article/s14630-1?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22croatian%22%2C%22croatian%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1428,"DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT,","1996 The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill. Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the pending amendment aside. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 2840 (Purpose: To provide funding for the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration for implementing certain recommendations and for carrying out a transition) Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan], for himself, Mr. Burns, Mr. Hollings, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Graham, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Reid, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Thurmond, proposes an amendment numbered 2840. Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: At the appropriate place, insert the following: United States Travel and Tourism Administration salaries and expenses For necessary expenses of the United States Travel and Tourism Administration, for implementing the recommendations from the White House Conference on Travel and Tourism and for carrying out the transition of that Administration into a public-private partnership, $12,000,000, to be transferred from the amount for deposit in the Commerce Reorganization Transition Fund (established under section 206(c)(1) of this title) that is made available in the item under the heading ``commerce reorganization transition fund'' under the heading ``General Administration'' under this title, notwithstanding any other provision of law. Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to report the floor manager has indicated that this amendment will be accepted. I want to acknowledge the support of the distinguished Senator from Montana, who has been most helpful in working through this amendment. I yield the floor, if I may, to him. I made remarks earlier this morning. This deals with the USTTA. The distinguished floor managers have accommodated that. I yield to the Senator from Montana. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana. Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nevada. I do not think there is anybody on the Commerce Committee who is any more dedicated to the health of the industry we call tourism. If the American people would look around, this happens to be one part of the Commerce Department that produces an export that is $20 billion to this country in the black--not in the red. In fact, if it was not for agriculture and tourism, our balance of payments would look really bad. But when any industry produces around $77 billion in foreign exchange earnings every year, we have to take note, especially since this country probably makes less investment in this part of our national economy than any other part. Mr. President, 7.7 million people visited our State of Montana. Sometimes [[Page S 14631]] we think we are pretty authentic, but I also understand where the Senator from Nevada is coming from, too, because they have a very active tourism part of their State government and he has been supportive of that. If this amendment is accepted, it is only an increase of around $5 million, because there is already $7 million of transition funds in there. Also, the plans and preparations are being made to privatize this department because the tourism industry wants to put together the funds. They think they can do a better job in establishing this commission than the Government can, and we agree with them. But let us give them the time, some funds, and a transition period and let them do it. Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as a former Governor of Florida, where the tourism industry is the State's largest employer, I am amazed at the fact that an industry with such tremendous economic impact can continually be so under-appreciated and misunderstood. Travel and tourism is the second largest industry in the United States behind health care, employing more than 13 million Americans both directly and indirectly. Last year, foreign spending on U.S. travel accounted for 39 percent of all service exports and 9 percent of total U.S. exports resulting in a $22 billion trade surplus. The work of the administration gives our country international presence. USTTA plays an important role in helping States and the private sector to develop its international travel market, a part of a coordinated national marketing and economic strategy. State governments and private industry depend on USTTA research to assist them in marketing activities and spending decisions. In Florida, tourism represents a $33 billion a year industry, employing 750,000 residents. International visitors, who make up 20 percent of Florida tourists, also have a regional impact. Often, tourists first visiting the United States will travel to Florida or California. On subsequent visits, however, statistics show they are likely to travel throughout the region or the country. Yet while we are debating this issue today it is imporant to note that the National Governors Association at their 1995 summer meeting, adopted a resolution supporting the USTTA and their proposal to transition the agency into a public private partnership at the end of fiscal year 1996. The resolution states: The Governors believe that a strong public private partnership is essential to promote tourism abroad and increase visitation to the United States. The Governors also believe that in a number of areas, the federal government bears responsibility for functions that can ensure benefits for state and national economies and international visitors. This resolution like the Bryan-Burns amendment has bipartisan support because in the final analysis international tourism promotion is an investment in economic development and job creation. The United States cannot afford to be the only one of 157 developed nations without an official National Tourism Office. Additionally, the first ever White House Conference on Travel and Tourism will bring together the recommendations of over 15,000 travel and tourism representatives from the 55 States and territories. One of the key recommendations to be announced is the strong support for a national tourism office that will serve as a catalyst for implementing a national tourism strategy for the 21st century. Please join me in supporting the Bryan-Burns amendment which provides one additional year of funding at the $12 million level to allow the agency to transition itself in a businesslike and professional manner while implementing the recommendations of the first ever White House Conference of Travel and Tourism. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think we have worked out a good agreement here. We have decided in the committee to terminate this agency. Our dear colleagues asked for a provision that would allow them to phase it out over a year's period with a definite commitment that at the end of the year it is gone, with a transition into a private partnership program. I think it is an excellent amendment. I am happy to accept it. I know Senator Hollings feels the same way, so we are happy to accept this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? The Senator from Nevada. Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I acknowledge publicly my appreciation for the response of the Senator from Texas. I ask unanimous consent the junior Senator from California, Senator Boxer, be listed as a cosponsor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the amendment. The amendment (No. 2840) was agreed to. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote. Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Amendment No. 2841 (Purpose: To protect the reproductive rights of Federal women prisoners) Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the pending amendment is set aside. The clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Snowe, and Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 2841. The amendment is as follows: On page 34, strike lines 1 through 7. Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair. Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield to my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire on the condition I do not lose my right to the floor. Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I seek to propound a unanimous consent request at this time that I will present a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to this amendment that is pending, there will be 20 minutes of debate equally divided, that there will be a vote at 6 o'clock on the sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I ask unanimous consent that be agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, I am prepared to accede to the vote at 6 o'clock providing there is a consent to my amendment which I discussed with the manager. Mr. GRAMM. Which is this? Mr. SPECTER. This is the amendment to strike the language which prohibits the expenditure of funds to pay for abortion for a woman in prison. Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader. Mr. DASCHLE. I will not object with the understanding it has been cleared on our side. Is that the understanding of the Senator from Pennsylvania? Mr. SPECTER. No; it has not been cleared on that side. Mr. DASCHLE. Then we have to object until I have had the opportunity to consult with our manager. Mr. SPECTER. I object to the interruption of the pendency of the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the amendment which I have sent to the desk--I had not sought clearance from Senator Hollings because Senator Gramm objected to it so there was no point in seeking clearance. But the amendment provides we strike lines 1 through 7 on page 34. The amendment would strike the following language: None of the funds appropriated by this title shall be available to pay for abortion except where the life of the mother would be in danger if the fetus were carried to term, or in the case of rape, provided that should this prohibition be declared unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this section shall be null and void. Mr. President, the law at the present time is that a woman in prison may obtain an abortion under circumstances where the prison authorities think it is appropriate to do so. The use of this procedure has been very, very limited. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order. Mr. SPECTER. The procedures have been used on a very limited basis. [[Page S 14632]] From April of 1995 through July 18, only nine abortions were performed on Federal women prisoners. The restrictions on the ban were lifted in late 1993, but when language was not included in the appropriation bill, the Bureau took more than 1 year to reestablish procedures for funding abortion services. In 1994, I am advised that there were 73 live births to Federal prisoners. In 1995 there have been 21 births. The Bureau of Prisons advises that there are nearly 7,000 women incarcerated for Federal crimes, and about 70 percent of those are there on drug offenses. The situation would exist, if this language were to become law, the language which I seek to strike, that women in prison who have a serious medical need would be denied an abortion. They obviously are not in the position to pay for their own abortions when they are in jail and unable to earn any money. By way of background, in 1995, an amendment was offered to prohibit funding to the Federal prison system for abortions on pregnant inmates except when the life of the mother was in danger. A tabling motion failed on a 46 to 46 vote. Then the amendment was defeated on a constitutional point of order--may we have order, Mr. President? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. The amendment was then defeated on a constitutional point of order 47 to 48, that prisoners are legally entitled to adequate medical care when there exists a serious medical need. The thrust of this amendment would place women in prison in a very disadvantaged position, and it is my view this language ought to be stricken. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the amendment offered by the distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania. The amendment would strike from the bill before us the provision which prohibits Federal funds from being used for abortion services for women in Federal prison. But, let me be clear. The amendment would leave intact language in the bill which provides a conscience clause for those opposed to abortion. That language, which this amendment does not touch, ensures that no person would be required to perform, or facilitate in any way the performance of, any abortion. Let me tell you why I believe this amendment must be adopted. The provision contained in the committee-passed bill is part of a wideranging assault on women's reproductive rights. Mr. President, it is going to be a long autumn for America's women. Let us look at what has happened already. The Senate has voted to deny women who are Federal employees coverage under their health plans for abortion services. A Senate/House conference committee has voted to ban abortions for women in the military stationed overseas. The House has voted to let States deny Medicaid abortions for victims of rape and incest. The House version of the D.C. appropriations bill would tell the District of Columbia that it can not use its own, locally raised, revenues for abortions for poor women. Legislation to ban certain late term abortions, even when severe fetal abnormalities are present or the woman's life or health is at serious risk, is under consideration in both the House and Senate. And now, under the bill before us, no abortions for women in Federal prisons. Action after action, vote after vote, we have seen yet another attack on women's reproductive rights. We are facing a full scale assault on women's constitutionally protected right to choose. Those who oppose reproductive rights know better than to launch a direct attack. The public strongly supports the right to choose, and the antichoice forces know it. So, instead they chip away at the right, hoping perhaps that no one will notice that yet another group of women have lost their rights. The bill before us today picks upon a particularly vulnerable population. Women in prison. Women who are totally dependent on health care services provided by the Bureau of Prisons. Let us be honest. There is no significant Federal expense involved in providing abortions for women in Federal prisons. Only nine women have obtained abortions since earlier prohibitions were repealed in 1993. So this is of no real consequence to the Federal budget. Yet, it is a huge issue for the few women who do find themselves in this desperate circumstance. These are not women who have the resources to ever afford private medical services. So by including this provision in this bill we are voting to deny these women access to a legal medical procedure. And who are these women? Over two thirds of the women in Federal prisons are drug offenders. Many of them are in poor health, perhaps HIV-infected, or suffering from AIDS--with all the risks this entails for a developing fetus. Many are themselves victims of abuse. To add to all this, if these women are forced to carry a child to term, they face the certainty that the child will be taken from them. How can we force women facing these circumstances to bear children against their will? To deny these women the right to make their own decision on abortion--a decision carefully arrived at after consultation with a physician and appropriate counseling--is unconscionable. The provision included in this bill is bad policy. It is one more attack on women's reproductive rights. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the amendment offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania. in opposition to back-door approach to undermining the constitutional right to an abortion Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to sections 103 to 105 of the Commerce Justice State appropriations bill. These sections would further undermine the constitutional right to an abortion. The right to an abortion was first articulated by the Supreme Court in the 1973 Roe versus Wade decision. This decision balanced the interests of protecting the fetus with the important interests of the mother, establishing a trimester system under which the right to choice in this country was delineated. Subsequent decisions have held that the Government may not place an undue burden on the woman's right, prior to fetal viability, to make a decision whether or not to have an abortion. There is no right to choose without access to choice. Restricting women's choice on these appropriations bills, and on other unrelated legislation, is a circumspect, back-door approach to prohibiting abortions. For women who cannot afford an abortion on their own, for poor women, this back-door approach to limiting abortions is just one more step to a back alley abortion. The many efforts to undercut the constitutional right to an abortion in this Congress, and earlier Congresses, have been documented by the National Abortion Rights Action League in their publication, ``The Road to the Back Alley.'' I recommend that interested individuals consult this publication. Efforts to undercut a woman's right to choose have included: Blanket restrictions on Federal funding for abortions. As an alternative to unsuccessful congressional efforts to prohibit abortion outright, abortion opponents have worked to ban the use of Federal funds to pay for abortions. These restrictions, popularly referred to as ``Hyde amendments,'' have been attached to appropriations bills ever since Roe Versus Wade. The most recent of such measures was Representative Istook's amendment to give States the option of not providing funds to Medicaid recipients in cases of rape and incest. Banning U.S. aid to international family planning groups performing abortions or abortion counseling. In June, the House approved an amendment to a foreign affairs bill that would ban U.S. aid to any international organizations that perform abortions, counsel women on abortions, or lobby on abortion issues. Prohibiting health insurance companies from paying for abortions for Federal employees. On July 19, the House approved reinstatement of legislation [[Page S 14633]] prohibiting the Federal Employees Health Insurance Program from paying for abortions, except when a woman's life is in danger. The Senate approved similar language on August 4, with exceptions for rape and incest. Barring abortions at military hospitals, even when paid for privately. On June 16, the House voted to restore a ban President Clinton had lifted against privately funded abortions in overseas military hospitals. Prohibiting certain types of late-term abortions. On July 18, the House Judiciary Committee reported legislation that would make it a crime for doctors to perform a late-term abortion procedure called intact D&E. This procedure is extremely rare, and almost exclusively limited to cases in which tragic fetal deformities have been detected. This is only a partial list of the back-door assaults on a woman's right to choose. The proposed language is just one more step in the long line of rollbacks on women's reproductive freedoms. I urge my colleagues to strike this language from the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this is House language in the bill. The House language is very clear. We are talking about taxpayers' money. Both the House and the Senate have taken the position that when the taxpayers' money is being spent to fund abortions, that abortion should be restricted, that it ought to be restricted to rape, to incest, and to the life of the mother. What the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania will do by striking the Hyde language from this bill is to basically give taxpayer funding for abortion on demand. I do not believe that the House or the Senate supports that action, and I am opposed to it. Let me see if any of my colleagues want to speak on the issue. If not, we will have a motion to table. Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to make another attempt at propounding this unanimous consent. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the debate and disposal---- Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, may we have order? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Will Senators and staff please take their conversations to the cloakrooms? The Senator from New Hampshire may proceed. Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of debate on the present Specter amendment, that my sense-of-the-Senate proposal--which would be to the underlying bill which will be offered and not be subject to a second degree--would be debated for 20 minutes, with 10 minutes on both sides, and that there would then be a sequence of votes should there be a vote ordered on the Specter amendment. If there is not a vote ordered on the Specter amendment, then there would be just a vote that would occur on my sense-of-the-Senate amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will agree to that time agreement, and I think 10 minutes on each side is adequate. I will only modify it with the one additional request, that the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, be recognized to offer the next amendment following the disposition of the Specter amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, I want to be sure I understand this. At the conclusion of the debate on this amendment, then the Gregg amendment would follow, and there would be back-to-back votes on my amendment and the amendment by the Senator from New Hampshire. Mr. GREGG. There would be 20 minutes of debate on my sense of the Senate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, is there an understanding as to how long we will be debating the Specter amendment? Could we get a time agreement on that? Mr. GRAMM. It is our intention to move to table the amendment now. Mr. SMITH. Will the Senator yield? I say to the minority leader, I have no intention to debate. I am prepared to move to table. But I do not want to cut the debate off if there are others who wish to speak. At this time, if it is appropriate, I move to table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent offered by the Senator from New Hampshire, as modified by the Democratic leader? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I move to table the Specter amendment. Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from New Hampshire hold off on that for a brief reply to what the Senator from Texas had to say? Mr. SMITH. Yes. I withhold. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, by way of a very brief reply, the language in this bill is even more restrictive than the Hyde amendment. As the Senator from Texas has propounded, the language of the Hyde amendment limits abortion except for rape, incest, or the life of the mother, and that amendment does not even permit an abortion in the event of incest. Rather, the current language of the bill does not permit abortion even in the event of incest. The language is that none of the funds appropriated by this title--in prison, my colleague from Texas says. But a prisoner can be impregnated as a result of incest before coming to prison. This language is even more restrictive than the Hyde language. This language says that none of the funds appropriated by this title shall be available for an abortion except for the life of the mother---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold, the Senate will please come to order. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. SPECTER. Except when the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term, or in the case of rape. It is entirely possible that a woman might be the victim of incest prior to the time she is incarcerated. It still takes 9 months from the time of impregnation to give birth to a child. Incest is a distinct possibility within that time limit. Contrary to what the Senator from Texas has said, this is not a matter of abortion on demand. This is a matter of abortion when the prison authorities permit the abortion to be carried out. It is not a matter that a woman can simply demand it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senate please come to order? Mr. SPECTER. And if there is a case of serious medical need, a woman ought to be entitled to have an abortion. These women are in prison. They are obviously not able in most cases--in many cases--to earn enough money to have an abortion. When the matter is left within the discretion of the prison officials considering all the circumstances, it has been used on a very, very limited basis, with the statistics showing that only seven abortions were conducted in a period of several months since they were begun in April 1995 through mid-July. I think this is a very reasonable position leaving the decision in the hands of the prison authorities, and I urge adoption of the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, if no one seeks recognition for further debate, I move to table the Specter amendment. Mr. FORD. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New Hampshire is recognized for 10 minutes. Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair. Amendment No. 2842 Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg) proposes an amendment numbered 2842. Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. [[Page S 14634]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: At the appropriate place insert the following: It is the sense of the Senate that none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available pursuant to this act should be used for the deployment of combat-equipped forces of the Armed Forces of the United States for any ground operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina unless-- (1) Congress approves in advance the deployment of such forces of the Armed Forces; or (2) the temporary deployment of such forces of the Armed Forces of the United States into Bosnia and Herzegovina is necessary to evacuate United Nations peacekeeping forces from a situation of imminent danger, to undertake emergency air rescue operations, or to provide for the airborne delivery of humanitarian supplies, and the President reports as soon as practicable to Congress after the initiation of the temporary deployment, but in no case later than 48 hours after the initiation of the deployment. Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the amendment which I proposed originally I had planned to offer as to the continuing resolution, as an act versus a sense-of-the-Senate, but in an attempt to accommodate my colleagues-- -- Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, may we have order? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is correct. Staff and Members will please take their conversations to the Cloakroom. Mr. GREGG. To accommodate my colleagues---- Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. I cannot hear the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is correct. The Senators to the left of the Chair, please take their conversations to the Cloakroom. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his courtesy. Mr. President, in an attempt to accommodate my colleagues, who I understand wish to move on to other business but who I also think desire to speak on this issue in some manner before we break for a week, I have made this---- Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I may say, there are conversations on the floor of the U.S. Senate when the Senator is trying to speak about a very crucial issue that is a matter of life and death, and I urge, if the Chair could, the Chair to be even stronger than he has been to get some order because it is hard for me to hear sitting right across from the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is attempting to be strong. I hope the Senators will be strong in holding forth their conversations elsewhere. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair for his strength. The purpose of this amendment is to raise the issue of how this legislative body should address the pending potential introduction of troops into Bosnia, American troops. The administration has stated on a number of occasions that it is a distinct possibility that up to 25,000 American soldiers will be asked to serve on the ground in Bosnia. That, of course, creates a significant issue first for those soldiers who would be putting their lives at risk but also for us as a country as to whether or not it is appropriate for us to be asking our men and women to put at risk their lives in this conflict. It seems, when there has been such a clear statement of purpose and potential risk for American troops, it is appropriate that we as a Congress act to either approve that action or disapprove that action. Clearly, the power to undertake actions which put American soldiers' lives in harm's way lies primarily and first with the President, but obviously we as a Congress also play a major role, not only on the appropriating side but, more importantly, on the side of being concerned for our soldiers, many of whom will obviously be our constituents. Therefore, I feel strongly that prior to the President taking this action, he should come to the Congress and ask for our approval. I believe he should meet three tests before we give him that approval. First, he should be able to define what it is that the soldiers will be asked to undertake, what the conflict is that we will be entering and what our role is in that conflict. Second, he should be able to explain to us the length of time and the manner in which they are going to serve when they are on the ground and what sort of risks they will be put at. And, third he needs to be able to express to us how we will be getting our soldiers out. I think it is very important that he define in this process what our national interest is in putting American lives at risk. That is the bottom line, I believe, that he must satisfy as President. In addressing that issue, the appropriate body to address it to, obviously, is the American people but also the Congress of the United States as the representative of the American people. Therefore, I do feel it is absolutely critical that before troops are deployed in this region, especially in the numbers which are being considered by the administration--25,000--we have a full and open debate of the matter here in the Congress and that we get from the President a clear and precise and understandable definition of purpose in undertaking this very serious act. So this sense-of-the-Senate resolution essentially addresses that issue. It says that the President shall come to the Congress before he sends troops into harm's way in Bosnia except in certain limited circumstances. The language which I have agreed to is actually language which I originally drafted and then presented to the other side, which was reviewed, and to which they made some adjustments, and I understand it is now acceptable to the Democratic leader. As such, I hope we could have strong support of this because it is clearly the role of the Congress to undertake this sort of debate and pursue this sort of action before our troops are deployed in this type of situation. I reserve the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who controls time in opposition to the amendment? Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I believe I am in control. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia. Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, could I be notified after 4 minutes? Mr. President, I agree with this amendment expressing the sense of the Senate that none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available pursuant to this act shall be used for deployment of combat equipped forces of the Armed Forces of the United States for any ground operations in Bosnia unless, and then the two conditions as set forth: Congress approves in advance deployment of such forces of the Armed Forces and the temporary deployment authority. Mr. President, this amendment does not have the effect of law and does not tie the President's hands. It does state the sentiment and view of the Senate of the United States. If it did tie the President's hands at this critical juncture while the peace negotiations are underway, I would oppose it and vote against it. We should not tie the hands of the President at this critical juncture. If the word went out that there was going to be no U.S. participation after a peace agreement is entered into, then there likely would be no peace agreement entered into by the parties. Mr. President, America must lead. We have seen what happens when we do not lead. We have recently seen what happens when we do lead. Our leadership must be in NATO and through NATO. Our objections to deployment, if there are objections to deployment, of troops by the United States should also be applicable to NATO troops because we are part of that alliance. It is not just the United States we are concerned about. It is also our allies and the alliance itself. Our conditions for deployment should be made known through NATO and that forum. Before any decision is made to deploy U.S. forces or in my view NATO forces pursuant to a peace agreement, we should ask a number of questions, a very difficult set of questions, a very important set of questions regarding that deployment. The first question that I would have--and there would probably be others that would occur to me as time goes on--are the borders between the various factions under the peace agreement both definable and defendable? Is [[Page S 14635]] this a sound peace agreement? If we are deploying pursuant to a peace agreement, the key question is, what kind of peace agreement? Is it a sound peace agreement? Does it have a reasonable chance of success? And can U.S. forces and NATO forces enhance the prospects of success? The second question I would have: Has the President clearly made the case to the American people that the deployment of U.S. ground forces is important to America's national security? That case must be made. The American people must understand this. They must support it. That is a condition that has to be fulfilled if we are going to have a sustainable position if things get rough in Bosnia. And they could get rough--no one should be mistaken about that--although the risk has gone down substantially compared to a month ago when the lines were not as clear as they have been since the recent ground action. Mr. President, the concern I have would not be simply the rights of the Bosnian Moslems versus the Bosnian Serbs but also the rights of the Bosnian Moslems vis-a-vis the Croatian-Bosnians, if that kind of federation breaks up. And it is very important that federation not break up. Another question, Mr. President, that I think has to be discussed by our executive branch and by Congress, do we have an exit strategy? By that I mean, do we know when the mission will be successful, when it will end and how we define success? That involves at least deciding in advance with our allies whether we are going to arm the Bosnian Moslems before we exit--before we exit--or whether we are going to find another way to level the playing field so that the parties can defend their own territory including the possibility of a build down. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 4 minutes. Mr. NUNN. I yield myself 1 more minute, Mr. President. Mr. President, the other question that occurs to me at this moment is whether NATO is clearly going to be in charge. NATO must be in charge. There must be no dual key. We cannot have a repeat of what we have had in the last 2 years with the United Nations having the dual key. I believe it is also imperative, if we are going to deploy NATO forces and U.S. forces, that we deploy a robust force, a force that is big enough and tough enough and well enough equipped not to be pushed around and to defend itself in the event of any kind of conflict. There must be clear rules of engagement. And those rules of engagement must permit a very vigorous response to any attack on U.S. forces or NATO forces. Mr. President, these are just a few of the questions that I believe are important. I reserve the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Lieberman and Senator Domenici as cosponsors. I yield 2 minutes to Senator Specter. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SPECTER. I support this sense-of-the-Senate resolution because I think it is indispensable that advance approval be given by Congress before U.S. troops are deployed, absent the emergency situation described in subparagraph 2. When the distinguished Senator from Georgia talks about impeding the ultimate peace agreement, it seems to me that we ought to put everyone on notice that congressional approval is required before there will be a commitment of 25,000 U.S. personnel. What we are really involved in in modern times is that the constitutional authority of the Congress to declare war has been undermined by the conflict in Korea, which was really a war without a congressional declaration, and by the Vietnam war, which was really a conflict there without a congressional declaration, the Gulf of Tonkin resolution not really being a substitute. There was very serious debate on the floor of this body in January of 1991 when the use of force was authorized. I took the position, as did many Senators, that the President, a Republican President, George Bush, did not have the authority to go into the gulf war without congressional authorization. The questions which have been posed by the Senator from Georgia are very important questions for congressional debate. We should not have a decision made to obligate U.S. personnel without congressional authority. And everyone who is a party to the negotiations there ought to understand that that is the position of the Congress. Without support from the American people, the military action cannot be sustained. That support is determined by the action of the Congress of the United States. So this is a very important resolution to put everyone on notice, including the President of the United States. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields time? Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator from Georgia yield me 1 minute? Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia. Mr. NUNN. I yield the Senator from Michigan 1 minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 1 minute. Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator and I thank the Chair. I wonder if the Senator would be willing to answer a question relative to his understanding of this resolution. I, first of all, think he laid out a series of very important questions, and I concur that those are critical questions that need to be answered prior to the use of ground forces in Bosnia. But my question of the Senator is this: He pointed out this is not legally binding because it is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. If this same language at a later time were offered without the words that it is a ``sense of the Senate'' so that it did then become a legally binding document or language, would it be consistent for those of us who might vote yes today to vote no at a later time because of the timing of the offer of that language or for any other of a number of possible reasons? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator yield me 30 additional seconds? Mr. NUNN. I yield myself 30 seconds. I will respond to the Senator from Michigan that his question should be answered, yes, it would be consistent. There is a great deal of difference in expressing to the President what the view of the Senate is and then passing a law that binds the President, particularly when this kind of negotiation is going on. So it would be consistent. Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. GREGG. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized for 2 minutes. Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I went to the White House today and met with the President and Members of the Senate on this particular subject. I took the occasion at that time to make three points: First, the American public needs to fully and completely understand what U.S. national security interests are at stake before the United States commits or sends United States service men and women to Bosnia. Next, the President of the United States should not commit or send U.S. troops without congressional approval. Now, if that congressional approval is given--this is the third point--any U.S. forces will have to be under the NATO operational control with robust rules of engagement. And I feel that this is such a serious situation, that these three points should be observed in considering this important matter. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire also for working out language with us. This is precisely the same thing we have already voted on in the Senate by 99 to 1. We basically already approved this language. It is a variation in the language here today. But it is the same principle. And the principle is very simple; that if we are going to engage in a large-scale peacekeeping effort, the country is better off and the President [[Page S 14636]] is better off with approval from Congress. I think it is very important to note that the meeting that the Senator from South Carolina just talked about today was attended broadly by House and Senate Members, bipartisan leadership. The President made it very clear, saying that he thought President Bush did the right thing in coming to Congress to ask for approval. He thought the Congress did the right thing in giving it. But we should remember that President Bush sent 500,000 troops to the gulf prior to any approval from Congress. All he had was a sense-of-the-Senate resolution saying this was OK after the fact. The President appropriately has reserved the right with respect to constitutional power not to make a commitment. And we should not hold him to that. So I think it is entirely appropriate here today to say that a sense of the Senate should have unanimous approval. But if this were a law tying the hands of the President, I think many Members on the other side would also join us in disapproving it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. NUNN. I reserve the remainder of my time. How much time do I have remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 55 seconds. Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, of that time, I yield to the Senator from Illinois 1 minute and I yield to the Senator from Connecticut 55 seconds. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 1 minute. Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I agree with everything the Senator from Georgia had to say. I reach a different conclusion. And I may be the only one voting against this. Tom Friedman of the New York Times had a column recently in which he said, ``France acts like a great power but does not have the resources. The United States has the resources but does not act like a great power.'' We cannot have effective foreign policy if Congress micromanages it. The Senator from Georgia asks a series of questions. I think there is one other question. Does it help peace in Bosnia to adopt this resolution? I think it unnecessarily raises questions, and I am going to vote against the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for the remaining time. Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment. I am privileged to be a cosponsor of it because I think it ought to be the beginning of bipartisan cooperation on this question of authorizing American troops to be part of a peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. The fact is that this amendment is consistent with what President Clinton has said. He has clearly said he expects and would welcome congressional action prior to any dispatch of American troops to Bosnia to enforce a genuine and just peace agreement. Mr. President, I want to make very clear that I view the exercise of American leadership to bring about the NATO strikes which have brought Bosnia now to the verge of peace as an exercise of leadership which has revived NATO's credibility. There is no way, if there is a peace agreement, that we can maintain our credibility and NATO's if we do not contribute American troops to that peacekeeping force. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. Mr. GREGG. How much time do I have remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 2 minutes 40 seconds. Mr. GREGG. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Maine. Mr. COHEN. Let me take a moment to challenge the notion that somehow the U.S. Senate is engaged in micromanagement. We are talking about the President of the United States, who is considering deploying 25,000 troops to one of the most hostile regions in the world, that has been filled for centuries with ethnic hatred, poison and death. And we are talking about deploying those troops to that region without having any sort of defined plan presented to us, without knowing what the ground rules are going to be, so to speak, without knowing who is in charge, without knowing what the Russian role is going to be. If ever there was a case in which we ought to be consulted and give approval, it is this one. Let me also take issue with those who said, ``Well, President Bush finally came to Congress.'' It was only after we insisted day in and day out and by going down to the White House, that the President finally agreed to come to Congress to get authority. Before that President Bush was determined to say, ``I only have to get authority from the United Nations, that's where I get my authority.'' We resisted that, and we actually forced the administration to come to us. Not only was it politically wise for him to do so, but we believe he was constitutionally mandated to do so. So the notion that somehow we are micromanaging is misconceived. We are the ones who raise and support the Army, and we have a coequal responsibility, not just the President, if we start deploying 25,000 troops to a region that has been afflicted over the centuries with hatred and conflict. Mr. President, I support the Senator's resolution. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 40 seconds remaining. Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this resolution lays down the ground rules for any major American involvement in Bosnia, and essentially they are: The President must explain to this Congress and the American people what the national interest is which justifies putting American lives at risk, and must receive the approval of this Congress before those lives are put at risk. That is a reasonable request in a democracy, and I appreciate the support of the Members of the Senate in this matter. Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The majority leader. Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I will use 2 minutes of my leader's time to comment on the pending matter. We had a good meeting with the President this afternoon. Many of us were there, Republicans and Democrats. I think he understands the administration needs to present their case to Congress. I asked three questions, very short questions: How many? How long? And how much? How many American troops, men and women are going to go to Bosnia? How long are they going to be there? And how much will it cost? That is the first thing the American people want to know. I believe we are making progress in that part of the world because of the bipartisan efforts of Members of Congress who have stood firm in support of a small nation, an independent nation, a member of the United Nations, Bosnia and Herzegovina. That plus the Croatian military action a couple of months ago, in my view, moved us along, plus the negotiating efforts by the administration. So I think everybody can take some credit. But the case has not been made to this point. It may be made, perhaps it will be made. The view I had from the President, without quoting anything he said, is that he certainly understood that they would have to come up and make their case. They are going to ask for money, and I think they will go before the Foreign Relations Committee, maybe the Armed Services Committee and maybe make an excellent case. I know how bitter some of the debate was during the gulf crisis, and I know many in this body said we ought to have sanctions, that sanctions would work. We still have sanctions, and Saddam Hussein is still there. It has been years and years, so that was not the right way to go. In any event, I hope that we will do what we should do. We are talking about American lives, American young men and women, and we do need to make a very careful judgment, and I think this sends a strong signal that we will make that careful judgment. I thank my colleague. Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. [[Page S 14637]] Mr. EXON addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska. Mr. EXON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be granted 1 minute for debate before the vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. EXON. Madam President, I wish to congratulate the majority leader for the remarks he just made. I thought it was an excellent meeting at the White House today. I will simply say that I think the President unquestionably has agreed to consult with the Congress. I believe that commitment was made again today. This is a very critical time. I hope and believe that adoption of this measure is meaningless, but I hope and think at this particular time we could do no good by adopting this once again, but, obviously, it will be adopted. I will oppose it because I think it is ill-timed for us to be stepping into this matter once again at this particular juncture. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter the President sent to me on October 20, 1993. Let me read one paragraph: I also have made clear that it would be helpful to have a strong expression of support of the United States Congress prior to the participation of U.S. forces in implementation of a Bosnian peace accord. For that reason, I would welcome and encourage congressional authorization of any military involvement in Bosnia. There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: The White House, Washington, DC, October 20, 1993. Hon. Robert Dole, United States Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Leader: The violent conflict in the former Yugoslavia continues to be a source of deep concern. As you know, my Administration is committed to help stop the bloodshed and implement a fair and enforceable peace agreement, if the parties to the conflict can reach one. I have stated that such enforcement potentially could include American military personnel as part of a NATO operation. I have also specified a number of conditions that would need to be met before our troops would participate in such an operation. I also have made clear that it would be helpful to have a strong expression of support from the United States Congress prior to the participation of U.S. forces in implementation of a Bosnian peace accord. For that reason, I would welcome and encourage congressional authorization of any military involvement in Bosnia. The conflict in Bosnia ultimately is a matter for the parties to resolve, but the nations of Europe and the United States have significant interests at stake. For that reason, I am committed to keep our nation engaged in the search for a fair and workable resolution to this tragic conflict. In closing, I want to express my sincere appreciation and respect for the manner in which we have been able to work together on important issues affecting national security. Over the years, the greatest successes in American foreign policy have had bipartisan support. I am gratified that we have been able to sustain that tradition and thank you for your leadership in that regard.

In fact, if it was not for agriculture and tourism, our balance of payments would look really bad. But when any industry produces around $77 billion in foreign exchange earnings every year, we have to take note, especially since this country probably makes less investment in this part of our national economy than any other part. Mr. President, 7.7 million people visited our State of Montana. Sometimes [[', 'Page S ', '14631]] we think we are pretty authentic, but I also understand where the Senator from Nevada is coming from, too, because they have a very active tourism part of their State government and he has been supportive of that.

', 'Mr. GRAHAM.', "" Mr. President, as a former Governor of Florida, where the tourism industry is the State's largest employer, I am amazed at the fact that an industry with such tremendous economic impact can continually be so under-appreciated and misunderstood. Travel and tourism is the second largest industry in the United States behind health care, employing more than 13 million Americans both directly and indirectly. Last year, foreign spending on U.S. travel accounted for 39 percent of all service exports and 9 percent of total U.S. exports resulting in a $22 billion trade surplus. The work of the administration gives our country international presence. "", 'USTTA ', 'plays an important role in helping States and the private sector to develop its international travel market, a part of a coordinated national marketing and economic strategy. State governments and private industry depend on ', 'USTTA ', 'research to assist them in marketing activities and spending decisions. In Florida, tourism represents a $33 billion a year industry, employing 750,000 residents. International visitors, who make up 20 percent of Florida tourists, also have a regional impact. Often, tourists first visiting the United States will travel to Florida or California. On subsequent visits, however, statistics show they are likely to travel throughout the region or the country. Yet while we are debating this issue today it is imporant to note that the National Governors Association at their 1995 summer meeting, adopted a resolution supporting the ', 'USTTA ', 'and their proposal to transition the agency into a public private partnership at the end of fiscal year 1996. The resolution states: The Governors believe that a strong public private partnership is essential to promote tourism abroad and increase visitation to the United States. The Governors also believe that in a number of areas, the federal government bears responsibility for functions that can ensure benefits for state and national economies and international visitors. This resolution like the Bryan-Burns amendment has bipartisan support because in the final analysis international tourism promotion is an investment in economic development and job creation. The United States cannot afford to be the only one of 157 developed nations without an official National Tourism Office. Additionally, the first ever White House Conference on Travel and Tourism will bring together the recommendations of over 15,000 travel and tourism representatives from the 55 States and territories. One of the key recommendations to be announced is the strong support for a national tourism office that will serve as a catalyst for implementing a national tourism strategy for the 21st century. Please join me in supporting the Bryan-Burns amendment which provides one additional year of funding at the $12 million level to allow the agency to transition itself in a businesslike and professional manner while implementing the recommendations of the first ever White House Conference of Travel and Tourism.

The amendment would strike the following language: None of the funds appropriated by this title shall be available to pay for abortion except where the life of the mother would be in danger if the fetus were carried to term, or in the case of rape, provided that should this prohibition be declared unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this section shall be null and void. Mr. President, the law at the present time is that a woman in prison may obtain an abortion under circumstances where the prison authorities think it is appropriate to do so. The use of this procedure has been very, very limited. ', 'The PRESIDING ', 'OFFICER.', ' The Senate will please come to order. ', 'Mr. SPECTER.', ' The procedures have been used on a very limited basis. [[', 'Page S ', '14632]] From April of 1995 through July 18, only nine abortions were performed on Federal women prisoners. The restrictions on the ban were lifted in late 1993, but when language was not included in the appropriation bill, the Bureau took more than 1 year to reestablish procedures for funding abortion services. In 1994, I am advised that there were 73 live births to Federal prisoners. In 1995 there have been 21 births. The Bureau of Prisons advises that there are nearly 7,000 women incarcerated for Federal crimes, and about 70 percent of those are there on drug offenses. The situation would exist, if this language were to become law, the language which I seek to strike, that women in prison who have a serious medical need would be denied an abortion. They obviously are not in the position to pay for their own abortions when they are in jail and unable to earn any money. By way of background, in 1995, an amendment was offered to prohibit funding to the Federal prison system for abortions on pregnant inmates except when the life of the mother was in danger. A tabling motion failed on a 46 to 46 vote. Then the amendment was defeated on a constitutional point of order--may we have order, Mr. President?

The amendment was then defeated on a constitutional point of order 47 to 48, that prisoners are legally entitled to adequate medical care when there exists a serious medical need. The thrust of this amendment would place women in prison in a very disadvantaged position, and it is my view this language ought to be stricken. ', 'Ms. MIKULSKI.', ' Mr. ', 'President, I ', ""am pleased to support the amendment offered by the distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania. The amendment would strike from the bill before us the provision which prohibits Federal funds from being used for abortion services for women in Federal prison. But, let me be clear. The amendment would leave intact language in the bill which provides a conscience clause for those opposed to abortion. That language, which this amendment does not touch, ensures that no person would be required to perform, or facilitate in any way the performance of, any abortion. Let me tell you why I believe this amendment must be adopted. The provision contained in the committee-passed bill is part of a wideranging assault on women's reproductive rights. Mr. President, it is going to be a long autumn for America's women. Let us look at what has happened already. The Senate has voted to deny women who are Federal employees coverage under their health plans for abortion services. A Senate/House conference committee has voted to ban abortions for women in the military stationed overseas. The House has voted to let States deny Medicaid abortions for victims of rape and incest. The House version of the D.C. appropriations bill would tell the District of Columbia that it can not use its own, locally raised, revenues for abortions for poor women. Legislation to ban certain late term abortions, even when severe fetal abnormalities are present or the woman's life or health is at serious risk, is under consideration in both the House and Senate. And now, under the bill before us, no abortions for women in Federal prisons. Action after action, vote after vote, we have seen yet another attack on women's reproductive rights. We are facing a full scale assault on women's constitutionally protected right to choose. Those who oppose reproductive rights know better than to launch a direct attack. The public strongly supports the right to choose, and the antichoice forces know it. So, instead they chip away at the right, hoping perhaps that no one will notice that yet another group of women have lost their rights. The bill before us today picks upon a particularly vulnerable population. Women in prison. Women who are totally dependent on health care services provided by the Bureau of Prisons. Let us be honest. There is no significant Federal expense involved in providing abortions for women in Federal prisons. Only nine women have obtained abortions since earlier prohibitions were repealed in 1993. So this is of no real consequence to the Federal budget. Yet, it is a huge issue for the few women who do find themselves in this desperate circumstance. These are not women who have the resources to ever afford private medical services. So by including this provision in this bill we are voting to deny these women access to a legal medical procedure. And who are these women? Over two thirds of the women in Federal prisons are drug offenders. Many of them are in poor health, perhaps HIV-infected, or suffering from "", 'AIDS-', ""-with all the risks this entails for a developing fetus. Many are themselves victims of abuse. To add to all this, if these women are forced to carry a child to term, they face the certainty that the child will be taken from them. How can we force women facing these circumstances to bear children against their will? To deny these women the right to make their own decision on abortion--a decision carefully arrived at after consultation with a physician and appropriate counseling--is unconscionable. The provision included in this bill is bad policy. It is one more attack on women's reproductive rights. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the amendment offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania. in opposition to back-door approach to undermining the constitutional right to an abortion "", 'Mrs. FEINSTEIN.', ' Mr. ', 'President, I ', ""rise in opposition to sections 103 to 105 of the Commerce Justice State appropriations bill. These sections would further undermine the constitutional right to an abortion. The right to an abortion was first articulated by the Supreme Court in the 1973 Roe versus Wade decision. This decision balanced the interests of protecting the fetus with the important interests of the mother, establishing a trimester system under which the right to choice in this country was delineated. Subsequent decisions have held that the Government may not place an undue burden on the woman's right, prior to fetal viability, to make a decision whether or not to have an abortion. There is no right to choose without access to choice. Restricting women's choice on these appropriations bills, and on other unrelated legislation, is a circumspect, back-door approach to prohibiting abortions. For women who cannot afford an abortion on their own, for poor women, this back-door approach to limiting abortions is just one more step to a back alley abortion. The many efforts to undercut the constitutional right to an abortion in this Congress, and earlier Congresses, have been documented by the National Abortion Rights Action League in their publication, ``The Road to the Back Alley.'' I recommend that interested individuals consult this publication. Efforts to undercut a woman's right to choose have included: Blanket restrictions on Federal funding for abortions. As an alternative to unsuccessful congressional efforts to prohibit abortion outright, abortion opponents have worked to ban the use of Federal funds to pay for abortions. These restrictions, popularly referred to as ``Hyde amendments,'' have been attached to appropriations bills ever since Roe Versus Wade. The most recent of such measures was Representative Istook's amendment to give States the option of not providing funds to Medicaid recipients in cases of rape and incest. "", 'Banning U.', 'S. aid to international family planning groups performing abortions or abortion counseling. In June, the House approved an amendment to a foreign affairs bill that would ban U.S. aid to any international organizations that perform abortions, counsel women on abortions, or lobby on abortion issues. Prohibiting health insurance companies from paying for abortions for Federal employees. On July 19, the House approved reinstatement of legislation [[', 'Page S ', ""14633]] prohibiting the Federal Employees Health Insurance Program from paying for abortions, except when a woman's life is in danger. The Senate approved similar language on August 4, with exceptions for rape and incest. Barring abortions at military hospitals, even when paid for privately. On June 16, the House voted to restore a ban President Clinton had lifted against privately funded abortions in overseas military hospitals. Prohibiting certain types of late-term abortions. On July 18, the House Judiciary Committee reported legislation that would make it a crime for doctors to perform a late-term abortion procedure called intact D&E. This procedure is extremely rare, and almost exclusively limited to cases in which tragic fetal deformities have been detected. This is only a partial list of the back-door assaults on a woman's right to choose. The proposed language is just one more step in the long line of rollbacks on women's reproductive freedoms. I urge my colleagues to strike this language from the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill. "", 'The PRESIDING ', 'OFFICER.', ' Is there further debate on the amendment? ', 'Mr. GRAMM.', "" Mr. President, this is House language in the bill. The House language is very clear. We are talking about taxpayers' money. Both the House and the Senate have taken the position that when the taxpayers' money is being spent to fund abortions, that abortion should be restricted, that it ought to be restricted to rape, to incest, and to the life of the mother. What the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania will do by striking the Hyde language from this bill is to basically give taxpayer funding for abortion on demand. I do not believe that the House or the Senate supports that action, and I am opposed to it. Let me see if any of my colleagues want to speak on the issue. If not, we will have a motion to table.

Rather, the current language of the bill does not permit abortion even in the event of incest. The language is that none of the funds appropriated by this title--in prison, my colleague from Texas says. But a prisoner can be impregnated as a result of incest before coming to prison. This language is even more restrictive than the Hyde language. This language says that none of the funds appropriated by this title shall be available for an abortion except for the life of the mother---- ', 'The PRESIDING ', 'OFFICER.', ' If the Senator will withhold, the Senate will please come to order. The Senator from Pennsylvania. ', 'Mr. SPECTER.', ' Except when the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term, or in the case of rape. It is entirely possible that a woman might be the victim of incest prior to the time she is incarcerated. It still takes 9 months from the time of impregnation to give birth to a child. Incest is a distinct possibility within that time limit. Contrary to what the Senator from Texas has said, this is not a matter of abortion on demand. This is a matter of abortion when the prison authorities permit the abortion to be carried out. It is not a matter that a woman can simply demand it. ', 'The PRESIDING ', 'OFFICER.', ' Will the Senate please come to order? ', 'Mr. SPECTER.', ' And if there is a case of serious medical need, a woman ought to be entitled to have an abortion.

', 'Mr. GREGG.', "" I thank the Chair for his strength. The purpose of this amendment is to raise the issue of how this legislative body should address the pending potential introduction of troops into Bosnia, American troops. The administration has stated on a number of occasions that it is a distinct possibility that up to 25,000 American soldiers will be asked to serve on the ground in Bosnia. That, of course, creates a significant issue first for those soldiers who would be putting their lives at risk but also for us as a country as to whether or not it is appropriate for us to be asking our men and women to put at risk their lives in this conflict. It seems, when there has been such a clear statement of purpose and potential risk for American troops, it is appropriate that we as a Congress act to either approve that action or disapprove that action. Clearly, the power to undertake actions which put American soldiers' lives in harm's way lies primarily and first with the President, but obviously we as a Congress also play a major role, not only on the appropriating side but, more importantly, on the side of being concerned for our soldiers, many of whom will obviously be our constituents. "", 'Therefore, I ', 'feel strongly that prior to the President taking this action, he should come to the Congress and ask for our approval. I believe he should meet three tests before we give him that approval. First, he should be able to define what it is that the soldiers will be asked to undertake, what the conflict is that we will be entering and what our role is in that conflict. Second, he should be able to explain to us the length of time and the manner in which they are going to serve when they are on the ground and what sort of risks they will be put at. And, third he needs to be able to express to us how we will be getting our soldiers out. I think it is very important that he define in this process what our national interest is in putting American lives at risk. That is the bottom line, I believe, that he must satisfy as President. In addressing that issue, the appropriate body to address it to, obviously, is the American people but also the Congress of the United States as the representative of the American people. ', 'Therefore, I ', ""do feel it is absolutely critical that before troops are deployed in this region, especially in the numbers which are being considered by the administration--25,000--we have a full and open debate of the matter here in the Congress and that we get from the President a clear and precise and understandable definition of purpose in undertaking this very serious act. So this sense-of-the-Senate resolution essentially addresses that issue. It says that the President shall come to the Congress before he sends troops into harm's way in Bosnia except in certain limited circumstances. The language which I have agreed to is actually language which I originally drafted and then presented to the other side, which was reviewed, and to which they made some adjustments, and I understand it is now acceptable to the Democratic leader. As such, I hope we could have strong support of this because it is clearly the role of the Congress to undertake this sort of debate and pursue this sort of action before our troops are deployed in this type of situation. I reserve the remainder of my time. "", 'The PRESIDING ', 'OFFICER.', ' Who controls time in opposition to the amendment? ', 'Mr. NUNN.', ' Mr. ', 'President, I ', 'believe I am in control. ', 'The PRESIDING ', 'OFFICER.', ' The Senator from Georgia. ', 'Mr. NUNN.', ' Mr. President, could I be notified after 4 minutes? Mr. ', 'President, I ', ""agree with this amendment expressing the sense of the Senate that none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available pursuant to this act shall be used for deployment of combat equipped forces of the Armed Forces of the United States for any ground operations in Bosnia unless, and then the two conditions as set forth: Congress approves in advance deployment of such forces of the Armed Forces and the temporary deployment authority. Mr. President, this amendment does not have the effect of law and does not tie the President's hands. It does state the sentiment and view of the Senate of the United States. If it did tie the President's hands at this critical juncture while the peace negotiations are underway, I would oppose it and vote against it. We should not tie the hands of the President at this critical juncture. If the word went out that there was going to be no U.S. participation after a peace agreement is entered into, then there likely would be no peace agreement entered into by the parties. Mr. President, America must lead. We have seen what happens when we do not lead. We have recently seen what happens when we do lead. Our leadership must be in "", 'NATO ', 'and through ', 'NATO.', ' Our objections to deployment, if there are objections to deployment, of troops by the United States should also be applicable to ', 'NATO ', 'troops because we are part of that alliance. It is not just the United States we are concerned about. It is also our allies and the alliance itself. Our conditions for deployment should be made known through ', 'NATO ', 'and that forum. Before any decision is made to deploy U.S. forces or in my view ', 'NATO ', 'forces pursuant to a peace agreement, we should ask a number of questions, a very difficult set of questions, a very important set of questions regarding that deployment. The first question that I would have--and there would probably be others that would occur to me as time goes on--are the borders between the various factions under the peace agreement both definable and defendable? Is [[', 'Page S ', '14635]] this a sound peace agreement? If we are deploying pursuant to a peace agreement, the key question is, what kind of peace agreement? Is it a sound peace agreement? Does it have a reasonable chance of success? And can U.S. forces and ', 'NATO ', ""forces enhance the prospects of success? The second question I would have: Has the President clearly made the case to the American people that the deployment of U.S. ground forces is important to America's national security? That case must be made. The American people must understand this. They must support it. That is a condition that has to be fulfilled if we are going to have a sustainable position if things get rough in Bosnia. And they could get rough--no one should be mistaken about that--although the risk has gone down substantially compared to a month ago when the lines were not as clear as they have been since the recent ground action. Mr. President, the concern I have would not be simply the rights of the Bosnian Moslems versus the Bosnian Serbs but also the rights of the Bosnian Moslems vis-a-vis the Croatian-Bosnians, if that kind of federation breaks up. And it is very important that federation not break up. Another question, Mr. President, that I think has to be discussed by our executive branch and by Congress, do we have an exit strategy? By that I mean, do we know when the mission will be successful, when it will end and how we define success? That involves at least deciding in advance with our allies whether we are going to arm the Bosnian Moslems before we exit--before we exit--or whether we are going to find another way to level the playing field so that the parties can defend their own territory including the possibility of a build down.

I believe it is also imperative, if we are going to deploy ', 'NATO ', 'forces and U.S. forces, that we deploy a robust force, a force that is big enough and tough enough and well enough equipped not to be pushed around and to defend itself in the event of any kind of conflict. There must be clear rules of engagement. And those rules of engagement must permit a very vigorous response to any attack on U.S. forces or ', 'NATO ', 'forces.

When the distinguished Senator from Georgia talks about impeding the ultimate peace agreement, it seems to me that we ought to put everyone on notice that congressional approval is required before there will be a commitment of 25,000 U.S. personnel. What we are really involved in in modern times is that the constitutional authority of the Congress to declare war has been undermined by the conflict in Korea, which was really a war without a congressional declaration, and by the Vietnam war, which was really a conflict there without a congressional declaration, the Gulf of Tonkin resolution not really being a substitute. There was very serious debate on the floor of this body in January of 1991 when the use of force was authorized. I took the position, as did many Senators, that the President, a Republican President, George Bush, did not have the authority to go into the gulf war without congressional authorization. The questions which have been posed by the Senator from Georgia are very important questions for congressional debate. We should not have a decision made to obligate U.S. personnel without congressional authority. And everyone who is a party to the negotiations there ought to understand that that is the position of the Congress. Without support from the American people, the military action cannot be sustained.

Tom Friedman of the New York Times had a column recently in which he said, ``France acts like a great power but does not have the resources. The United States has the resources but does not act like a great power.'' We cannot have effective foreign policy if Congress micromanages it. The Senator from Georgia asks a series of questions.

', 'Mr. COHEN.', "" Let me take a moment to challenge the notion that somehow the U.S. Senate is engaged in micromanagement. We are talking about the President of the United States, who is considering deploying 25,000 troops to one of the most hostile regions in the world, that has been filled for centuries with ethnic hatred, poison and death. And we are talking about deploying those troops to that region without having any sort of defined plan presented to us, without knowing what the ground rules are going to be, so to speak, without knowing who is in charge, without knowing what the Russian role is going to be. If ever there was a case in which we ought to be consulted and give approval, it is this one. Let me also take issue with those who said, ``Well, President Bush finally came to Congress.'' It was only after we insisted day in and day out and by going down to the White House, that the President finally agreed to come to Congress to get authority. Before that President Bush was determined to say, ``I only have to get authority from the United Nations, that's where I get my authority.'' We resisted that, and we actually forced the administration to come to us. Not only was it politically wise for him to do so, but we believe he was constitutionally mandated to do so. So the notion that somehow we are micromanaging is misconceived. We are the ones who raise and support the Army, and we have a coequal responsibility, not just the President, if we start deploying 25,000 troops to a region that has been afflicted over the centuries with hatred and conflict. Mr. "", 'President, I ', ""support the Senator's resolution. "", 'The PRESIDING ', 'OFFICER.', ' The Senator from New Hampshire has 40 seconds remaining. ', 'Mr. GREGG.', ' Mr. President, this resolution lays down the ground rules for any major American involvement in Bosnia, and essentially they are: The President must explain to this Congress and the American people what the national interest is which justifies putting American lives at risk, and must receive the approval of this Congress before those lives are put at risk. That is a reasonable request in a democracy, and I appreciate the support of the Members of the Senate in this matter. ', 'Mr. DOLE ', 'addressed the Chair.

How many American troops, men and women are going to go to Bosnia? How long are they going to be there? And how much will it cost? That is the first thing the American people want to know. I believe we are making progress in that part of the world because of the bipartisan efforts of Members of Congress who have stood firm in support of a small nation, an independent nation, a member of the United Nations, Bosnia and Herzegovina. That plus the Croatian military action a couple of months ago, in my view, moved us along, plus the negotiating efforts by the administration. ', 'So I ', 'think everybody can take some credit. But the case has not been made to this point. It may be made, perhaps it will be made. The view I had from the President, without quoting anything he said, is that he certainly understood that they would have to come up and make their case. They are going to ask for money, and I think they will go before the Foreign Relations Committee, maybe the Armed Services Committee and maybe make an excellent case. I know how bitter some of the debate was during the gulf crisis, and I know many in this body said we ought to have sanctions, that sanctions would work. We still have sanctions, and Saddam Hussein is still there. It has been years and years, so that was not the right way to go. In any event, I hope that we will do what we should do.

As you know, my Administration is committed to help stop the bloodshed and implement a fair and enforceable peace agreement, if the parties to the conflict can reach one. I have stated that such enforcement potentially could include American military personnel as part of a ', 'NATO ', 'operation. I have also specified a number of conditions that would need to be met before our troops would participate in such an operation. I also have made clear that it would be helpful to have a strong expression of support from the United States Congress prior to the participation of U.S. forces in implementation of a Bosnian peace accord. For that reason, I would welcome and encourage congressional authorization of any military involvement in Bosnia. The conflict in Bosnia ultimately is a matter for the parties to resolve, but the nations of Europe and the United States have significant interests at stake.

In closing, I want to express my sincere appreciation and respect for the manner in which we have been able to work together on important issues affecting national security.

I am gratified that we have been able to sustain that tradition and thank you for your leadership in that regard. Sincerely, Bill Clinton ']"
67,"REPORT OF FACTFINDING TRIP Mr. DORNAN. Mr. Speaker, we have had a fast 3 days. Started late on Wednesday, finishing early today. Pressure is building up here for a major budgetary struggle between the two major, only major parties in the world's only superpower, on all of these budgetary issues. We have come back from a long, what we sometimes euphemistically call a district work period. We are supposed to cram in a vacation and work hard. For some of us, it is hard work. I took one of the more difficult and fast-moving factfinding trips of my career, now that I am one of only two double chairmen out of all 435 Members of this Chamber. I chair a Subcommittee on Intelligence, the Subcommittee on Technical and Tactical Intelligence, and I chair the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, which becomes the most important of all 5 military subcommittees under the Committee on National Security, what used to be called Armed Services, and is still called Armed Services in the House of Lords or the other Chamber, the Senate. On this trip, in discussing the issues with new young enlisted men, senior sergeants, petty officers, and the officer corps at all levels, up to and including four-star admirals, at Naples, at the major air base that is in command of all the bombing missions going on as we speak over poor torn ripped Bosnia-Herzegovina. And at Brendezy, down at the coast at the very heel of the Italian peninsula. That is where we have our Navy Seals, where we have what was a major listening post base. In all the world, there are only five listening to everything, San Vito Air Station, using the international airport at Brendezy where we keep our AC-130 Hercules special mission Spectre gun ships. I met with all the crews there. It is still classified whether or not they are going in at night over Bosnia. These were the aircraft that if we had them in Somalia over Mogadishu, we would have saved a dozen or more lives of our best trained Army special forces and Delta Force, Rangers and 160th Aviation Regiment, special armed squadrons. Then I traveled with Congressman Greg Laughlin, the highest ranking active reservist in the House or the Senate, of Galveston, TX, and we went to Slovenia. A fascinating, brand-new country in the world. It never had nation status, let alone a seat in the United Nations since the dissolution of the Communist country of the former Yugoslavia. {time} 1315 Then we went down to Croatia, met with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's special representative to all of the problems in former Yugoslavia, Mr., that is his formal title, Mr. Sasushi Akashi, met with him at the U.N. headquarters, the blue helmet home plate in Zagreb, then went down along the Dalmatian coast, drove slowly through all of the destruction wreaked upon one of the world's most beautiful coastlines, looks for all the world like the California coastline between Santa Barbara and Monterey--just torn apart. The international airport in Zadar utterly destroyed except for the runways, all of the international terminal buildings, hollow shells of aluminum, like a nuclear explosion went off, the tower, all the windows shot out with AK-47's by the retreating Bosnian soldiers. They almost cut Croatia in half at that point, Zadar. Then we went down to Macedonia, met with all of our American tripwire forces out in the front outposts along the border, flew on white helicopters, UH-60 Blackhawks that, of course, called themselves the Whitehawks, with the United Nations stenciled on the sides, went out to these American outposts, studied this poor city of Skopje, which had been destroyed by an earthquake in 1963. It has never really made it back to a stable, functioning city, still great pockets of poverty from that horrible earthquake in 1963. Then we flew over to Albania, one of the most godforsaken but still physically beautiful countries in the world, and met with the president there, Sali Berisha, Mr. Berisha; he is a European renowned heart surgeon. His wife is a renowned doctor of pediatrics, a child doctor. What a lucky country to go from the depths of communism with a paranoidal maniac, Enver Hoxna, one of the last psychotic, paranoid Communist dictators in the world, who literally took this beautiful country of Albania, a brand new country created after World War I, not a traditional nation on the face of the Earth, and just drove it into the ground, more than a half-century of locked-up paranoia and total Communist psychotic oppression, and now they have a wonderful president who said to me and to the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Laughlin], although he wants to be in the United Nations and would like to be accepted into NATO, he does not care what happens in the world if he just has the friendship of the United States, just one on one, unilateral friendship, and he thinks Albania will make it into the 21st century. That is the identical message we got north of there in another one of the eight parts of Yugoslavia that have spun off in Solvenia, same message: ``U.S. friendship is what we want.'' In Albania, we looked at what was supposed to be a top-secret program [[Page H 8715]] and is now written about in all newspapers, the Predator, unmanned aerial vehicle [UAV] program. The pilots at that base, both Albanian and our U.S. Forces there, took us in a cave that the Chinese carved out of a mountain, a cave as long as several football fields, and there I looked at 24 or 25 MiG aircraft from the vintage of when I flew almost 40 years ago. There were MiG-19, ``Farmer'' was our NATO codeword, jets that they still fly, that were Russia's response to my F-100 Supersabre, and older jets from Korea, MiG Alley, early 1950's, MiG-15's and MiG-17's, the kind of airplane my colleague, the gentleman from California [Mr. Cunningham], shot down in North Vietnam. At least of his five victories, three are MiG-17's, all of this in this giant tunnel. And the landscape of the country is scarred, marred with 700,000 to 1 million concrete bunkers, pillboxes, machine gun posts, some of them as big as the entire rostrum of this House, others as big as from here to the other lectern, a million of them, maybe, making the whole landscape look ugly, and there is no money to remove them or drag them out to the sea and make a breakwater for a small boat harbor on this beautiful Dalmatian coast of the Adriatic. On that trip, at every stop I would take off my chairman's hat from intelligence and put on my chairman's hat from military personnel and ask our men and women at all levels of command what it will take to keep them in the military, to keep that expensive training that they were given to melt down the evil empire of the Soviet Union and stand guard over freedom and be part of the world's only superpower, and everywhere they talked about family, and quality of life; they spoke of what it would take them to earn a proper living with groceries, their compensation. So, all around that hot area of the world, I saw again that America is so lucky, as Ronald Reagan used to quote James Michener's great fictitious, but more fact than fiction, novel from the Korean war, ``The Bridges of Toko-Ri,'' ``Where do we get such men,'' and now we can say women, ``Where do we get such men and women?'' How are we so lucky as to have them serve us? The sad thing about this break, Mr. Speaker, is that we went through some of the greatest anniversaries with the House adjourned. The 50th anniversary of the end of the greatest crusade for freedom against tyranny in all of recorded history during our break, the 50th anniversary endings. We had adjourned by the time Sunday came up for the 50th anniversary of the bombing at Hiroshima; 3 days later Nagasaki, August 9. On August 15 in the Pacific, on the other side of the dateline, August 14 here, the end of shooting in the Second World War; not really so; Japanese imperial warload staff beheaded prisoners, shot them, killed all the prisoners at Unit 371 in Pingfan, outside of Mukden, Manchuria. They called these godforsaken human beings ``logs,'' to depersonalize them. They had shot them, amputated all four of their limbs, one at a time, let them recover from each amputation, training over a thousand doctors to go out to all the tentacles of the imperial octopus that was so abusing the whole eastern perimeter, western perimeter of the Pacific around Asia. They had boiled them to death to see what it was like. They had frozen them to death. They had tied them to trees and hit them with bombs and shrapnel and grenades. They had put flamethrowers on them. They had infected them with anthrax, all forms of biological warfare, and none of these people that I know of were brought to justice. That is why everybody is so grateful to the current Prime Minister of Japan, that he offered an apology that we cannot get out of their congress, their ``diet,'' but there were men killed after August 15 over there, and August 14 here. Many prisoners died. My friend, Jack Singlaub, was parachuted in with a small OSS team to the Chinese island of Hainan, under Japanese warload control. Notice I say ``warlord,'' to distinguish ourselves from the free democracy of Japan today, and it was mostly, it was all Australian and New Zealand prisoners, no Americans there. He loaded them on trains from this prison camp on the western side of Hainan island and took them over to the biggest port on the eastern side, and five or six Australian and New Zealand prisoners died on that train, but at least they died as free men. That was a very rough 2-week period. All of the prisoners were under death orders. If the United States invasion forces of Operation Olympic had set foot on the Japanese home islands, all prisoners were to be executed. Many were beheaded and beaten to death in the streets of Japanese cities if they were unfortunate enough to bail out over their target. Many of them miraculously survived. War crimes trials in Japan, but far less than those that were brought to the bar of justice, Hitler's war criminals. So we passed through all of those anniversaries without a word on this House floor, because we were out. Then came V-J Day. I decided I would spend V-J Day at our airbases encircling tortured Bosnia rather than be in Hawaii, where I planned to be and was invited to go with a World War II veteran, a young-looking gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Stump. I wanted to be on that trip, but I was so offended by the photo opportunities of the White House at the Normandy beaches to the exclusion of some of our heroes when they should have been the focus, that I did not want to subject myself to that, and I would have been pained to hear Mr. Clinton call the U.S.S. Missouri, the battleship upon which the Japanese surrender terms were unconditionally signed on September 2, 1945, I would have been pained to hear Mr. Clinton call it a carrier, an aircraft carrier. I would have been pained to hear him refer to the front of the ship, the bow, as the bow, as in a bow in your hair, and I guess he would call the stern the back side of the ship. If that had been Vice President Dan Quayle making verbal mistakes like that, you would all know about it. It would be headlines. But people are probably listening to C-SPAN today, 1,300,000 who think I am making that up. No, Mr. Clinton actually said those things, aircraft carrier Missouri, bow of it, as in bow and arrow, the bow of the ship. He got away with it. I preferred to be out with the troops in the field rather than at those wonderful closing ceremonies. But now a word here on the floor, Mr. Speaker. Here is what has been painful to me over the last 4 years: Except for the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. Montgomery], two-star general, retired in the Army, of the Montgomery GI bill fame, and the aforementioned gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Stump], Navy retiree, except for one 1-hour special order that they did on Iwo Jima, there has not been a single memorial on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives or the United States Senate for any single 50-year anniversary of anything that happened all during World War II, not Pearl Harbor, not the fall of Bataan, or the Bataan death march, not Corredigor, not the comeback at Guadalcanal, not the landings in Tarawa, not the Dieppe raid along the coast of Hitler's fortress Europe, not Al Alamein, not the battles at Tobruk, not the Kasserine Pass, not the landings at Sicily in July 9, 1943; we have heard here in July 1993, not Salerno, not Anzio, not Operation Overlord on D-Day, not Operation Dragon down on the southern coast of France, nothing about Okinawa, which came after Iwo Jima or the Gilbert Islands or Marshall Islands or the Battle of the Coral Sea or the Battle of Midway or the Battle of the Solomon Islands or the Santa Cruz Islands, nothing for 4 years in the Senate or the House floor pausing for a series of 1-minute speeches or 1-minute special orders. I am not saying this to pat myself on the back; except for about 10 of my 1-hour special orders, nothing, nothing on this House floor. I remember an Oklahoma Congressman shut this place down. I remember it because he lost his primary a few months later. I wondered if there was a connection. I think his name was Congressman Risenhoover. He shut this place down. We filled it with potted palms, and on Flag Day, June 14 in some late year in the late 1970's, I forget the year, we had the great western singers, June Carter and Johnny Cash, standing up there. We sang patriotic hymns, and we did Flag Day, and there was nothing special. It was not the 50th anniversary of Flag Day, or silver anniversary. It was just Flag Day, any June 14. The whole place shut down, palms, [[Page H 8716]] potted plants all over at every entrance. I have never seen the like of it, potted plants all around the front here. We do not do that for a State of the Union with the Commander in Chief standing up there. We did not do that for Douglas MacArthur or Winston Churchill the two times he stood up there. {time} 1330 I thought, ``Wow, we are going to do this, I guess, all during World War II. Am I lucky to be here.'' And, when George Bush got elected, because I went with President Bush to Pearl Harbor's 50th anniversary, and we stood there on that memorial across the midships of the U.S.S. Arizona, still a ship of the line, with the flag run up at reveille every morning. I thought, ``This is going to be great, go through all these 50-year anniversaries with a 58 combat mission Navy attack carrier pilot in the White House.'' And instead we ended up with someone who had avoided the draft three times, has insulted the military over, and over, and over with photo opportunities, using them to try to up his ratings, and thank God it fails every time, and here we are, past September 2, 1995, 50 years gone by. No memorials. Today I have an editorial, a counter-editorial, in the USA Today. They always put in the left-right views. They called my office at 2 o'clock yesterday, said, ``Give us something quick. Senator Warner is not responding fast enough, the No. 2 man on Armed Services Committee in the other body.'' They said, ``Give us something on why the military should be built up.'' We pumped out something quickly. I sent a corrected copy on a fax to USA Today at 3:30, and I said, ``Well, this will be in next week,'' and it is in this morning, a turnaround of about 15 hours before it hit the streets, and I would like to read it, Mr. Speaker. It says, ``Military Needs Buildup.'' It is what every one of these young, not-so-young, people all around the Mediterranean told me. ``Robert K. Dornan, opposing view: The military budget has been hit year after year. Security demands that we spend more.'' Now I have not read the USA Today house editorial that says we must gut defense even more, but here is my response on September 8: ``After 11 straight years of defense spending cuts, Republicans are providing the national security leadership not found in the current administration. ``Indeed, President Clinton's draconian defense budget would produce another Carter-era ``hollow force'' reportedly underfunded by as much as $150 billion. Congress, therefore, is not squandering money when it votes to increase the Pentagon's budget by $7 billion more than requested. Instead, it is restoring national security funding to necessary levels. ``How soon we forget what is required to quickly and decisively win on the modern battlefield. ``Today's military modernization is tomorrow's combat readiness. Systems such as the F-117 `Nighthawk' stealth fighter and the Patriot missile were not developed overnight. They were the culmination of years of research and development. These revolutionary systems drastically reduced our casualties'' killed in acting and wounded in action) ``in Desert Storm.'' more than any other conflict in history given the level of lethality, and violence, and speed, and maneuverability. ``Today we can improve upon these systems with new weapons that will further reduce the risk to American troops. ``The B-2 `Spirit' Stealth bomber,'' I helped to name that, so of course I want to get the name in, ``carries eight times the payload of the F-117, with greater range and crew survivability.'' Keep in mind, listening audience, Mr. Speaker, and my colleagues who may be packing up their bags in their offices to head back to their districts, that the B-2 survived in this Chamber by 3 votes, 213 to 210, to defeat an amendment, mostly by people who have never served in the military, to kill and shut down the world's only bomber production line, the B-2 ``Spirit.'' ``New missile defense programs, such as the upgraded Navy Aegis (A-e- g-i-s) system, provide greater range, accuracy, and coverage than Patriot missiles.'' We call that upper-tier Navy defense. Put two ships off Israel, two ships off Korea, just two ships, and the footprint from both those ships can keep Israel free from being struck with a nuclear weapon or, as we now find out from the defecting son-in-law of dictator, mad-dog killer Saddam Hussein; we now find out that, yes, they were driving to completion of a nuclear weapon and were playing around with the most deadly biological, and chemical, and nerve gas weapons since World War II and would have used them, and may have used them; the jury is out on that. So we need this Navy upper-tier Aegis system antimissile defense. ``Does the Pentagon need these expensive new programs? Ask the Air Force pilots who will not have to attack highly defended enemy targets in vulnerable, unstealthy aircraft because they will have the B-2. Ask the Marines and Army troops who will not have to worry about Scud ballistic missile attacks because of the Navy's new ballistic missile defense.'' All of this, of course, predicated upon the conference between the House and the Senate, the conference process that we are entering, that we entered this afternoon. My R&D Subcommittee is meeting as I speak. I decided that letting America know what we are doing was more important than participating in that meeting because I am not the chairman of that subcommittee; the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Weldon] is. My close in today's USA Today: ``These and other Republican initiatives in areas such as personnel and training will not just maintain, but will enhance, the combat capability that has so quickly deteriorated under Clinton's leadership. ``Those of us who visit,'' as I did in the Balkans over this break our troops, ``and listen to our front-line troops are giving them what they need,'' what they deserve, ``including equipment that will drastically reduce loss of'' precious, ``life.'' ``The Reagan revolution of the 1980's laid the foundation for'' the victory in, ``Desert Storm. The Republican revolution'' that started on November 8, ``of 1994 is laying the foundation for any future victories, if that is our fate, and the survival of U.S. combat troops well into the 21st century.'' Now, Mr. Speaker, I had intended to spend the better part of this hour special order on defense on some of the votes that we won this week. We won them all on the conservative side with the help of many conservative members of the former majority party, the oldest political party in America, the Democrats, but last night I kept a promise that I made to a Navy Seal at Brandezy, Italy. I do not want to identify him by rank, but let us put it this way. All the Seal's in the Mediterranean depend on this fine young officer and Annapolis graduate from decades ago. He said to me, ``Congressman Dornan, I appreciate you being in the Presidential race, although it appears you don't have much chance of victory, as I appreciate Mr. Keyes, Alan Keyes, of Maryland, because you discuss the moral issues which I believe are the critical issues of our time.'' Now keep in mind this is a senior naval officer trained to the peak of physical and mental performance for his country. He said, ``Congressman, I believe as a naval officer that the military culture is the last stable part of American life from which we can begin the rebuilding of our Nation's moral fiber, from which we can begin to defend the moral and cultural ethos that is collapsing around us.'' Now I would like to think there is a pocket of us on both sides of the aisle in the House and the Senate that also believe that we are in an advanced state of moral decline in our country. He said to me, this naval officer, ``Did you see the cover story of Newsweek in July on bissexuality?'' I said, ``No, captain, I did not.'' He said, ``Well, I canceled my subscription with a long letter to the New York publisher and senior editors saying that this was the most vile and corrupt article I've ever seen in my life.'' And I said, ``Well, every week in my office I get 10 magazines and about 10 newspapers,'' and I said, ``I try to read as much as any human being in the [[Page H 8717]] House or Senate. With all due immodesty, I've never seen anybody that reads more.'' And I said, ``I did not see this particular Newsweek. I can go weeks without even catching a cover story in Time, or Newsweek, or U.S. News and World Report, or all the other magazines that we get. Then there is all the great conservative publications, the moderate ones like New Republic I try to stay up with, and Crisis, and First Things, and cutting edge of Catholic and Protestant, conservative, magazines, and of course Bill Buckley, my old pal, with National Review--awful lot to read. We have tremendous responsibility here to stay informed on what our Speaker Gingrich calls the ``information highway'' to be an alert, informed man or woman in this place. It is an overwhelming job if you're trying to inform yourself of all aspects of the popular culture and try to cover the economic front, the foreign affairs front, the human rights front, the defense front, all the social issues at home, gang warfare, the O.J. Simpson trial, not as a gawking ``Lookie Lou,'' but as someone aware that this trial, as the Menendez trial has done, can put our whole jury system in jeopardy.'' And I promised this Navy SEAL that I would get the Newsweek article out of my huge piles of reading material in my office and take a look at it. I have only been home since the first of September. I got it out last night and read it. Here it is, Mr. Speaker. It is the Newsweek issue of July 17, so it hit the newsstands on Monday, July 10. I read it last night, and I agree with this naval officer, assigned at a forward base in Italy, a kind of a man who will go in and put his life on the line if another Captain Scott O'Grady gets shot down along the coast. The Navy SEAL's will have the job to go in and rescue them under fire, and I agree with this naval officer. This is the most corrupt article, let alone a cover story, that I have ever read in an American magazine in my life--Newsweek. The Washington bureau chief, and we are having our problems right now over another issue that personally involves my honor, and I will do a 1-hour special order or a personal privilege in the middle of the day-- no, I would not do that in September, budget month--to defend my honor from an attack by a reporter who has only been--who was not even hired when this issue came out, who attacked my honor and said I crashed four aircraft in the Air Force. I have not crashed one. Ejected twice from totally out-of-control aircraft, but he doubled that to four and said I crashed them and said I was a black ace, one kind of black ace. The only black aces I know were an F-14 squadron called the ``Black Aces'' in the unheralded until the HBO special in the last few weeks, the 99th fighter squadron, and then the 332nd Fighter Group, the Tuskegee airmen, our young fighter pilots in the Italian theatre of African- American heritage who are finally getting their recognition 52 years after they entered combat. That is the only ``Black Aces'' I know about. But I am having my problems with Evan Thomas, who I think is one of the better talking heads. He will be on television tomorrow, on a program called ``Inside U.S.A.,'' a handsome young man, and we are having out problems on this, but I have not talked to him about this issue, and I will. I am going to fly up to New York. I am going to go see Donald and Katharine Graham. She is chairman emeritus and has discussed this issue. I almost wonder if I can read this in the Chamber, but listen to this. I wish you folks were not leaving up there because--well, get the Congressional Record tomorrow and read this. Here is the article on bisexuality. It is under ``Lifestyle,'' of course. ``Bisexuality is the wild card of our erotic life. Now it is coming out in the open, in pop culture, in cyberspace, and on campus. But can you really have it both ways?'' They asked rhetorically, question mark, by John Leland. The answer is Newsweek thinks you can because in this article, one of America's great magazines--when I was a little kid coming out of St. Patrick's, I used to look at their beautiful headquarters building right there on Fifth Avenue across from Tiffany somewhere. Newsweek, which is owned by the Washington Post, one of America's three major newspapers, all of them liberal: L.A. Times, New York Times, Washington Post. They own this, so it is under Katharine and Donald Graham. Here is what Newsweek says about this issue. Brace yourself for culture shock if you are still shockable. They show here Theresa, and Ronelle, all these couples, Stephen and Linda. Of course, she's 47 and he's 30. They all have multiple partners, they all switch-hit, they are all AC/DC, they are dual- gaited. I remember all the cute words in New York, and, after all, I grew up in Manhattan and then west to Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, so I know all the flippant dialog. {time} 1345 Here is a woman, 48, with a young Hispanic guy, it looks like he is about 17, 18, 19; he is in his early 20's. Freud said we are all bisexual. He thought that exclusive heterosexuality was a problem. In the copy it says that he thought homosexuality was a problem, and he never got around to that, because he died and met God before he had a chance to get into that. But the article goes on, and by its commentary, approving of this fifth gender. Bella Abzug stands up in Beijing, China, in the middle of the world's most oppressive human rights, communistic dictatorship and mentions homophobia and gets a standing ovation from all of the assembled feminists of the world. if Ms. Hillary was in the room, she would have given her a standing ovation. So here in the picture of this blue-eyed, red-headed guy, Tim, 24, with Ellen, 30 years of age. She has done it all, it is always older women and younger guys in these bisexual things. Listen to this. ``The bisexual blip of the 1970's was an offshoot of the sexual revolution.'' Of course, Newsweek's position is the sexual revolution was just grand. Tell that to 200,000 people dead of AIDS, another million infected in this country, and 10 to 20 million affected all around the world. Make love, casual sex like alley cats, not war. So they refer to the sexual revolution in an approving way. ``The bisexual blip was an offshoot of that revolution. It was straight with a twist. By contrast, the current bisexual movement rises from the gay and feminists movements.'' Notice it did not say lesbian wing of the feminist movement, just the feminist movement. ``For a generation that came of age during the gay rights movement, same-sex relationships or experiments no longer carry the stigma they once did.'' Stigma. What would that mean? Would that mean sin? Right and wrong, evil, banal sin, mortal sin? Newsweek magazine, with this article, Mr. Speaker, and anybody listening, make no mistake about it, Newsweek magazine, with this July 17 cover story, is a direct frontal attack on everything that I was ever taught by my parents, by every teacher I had in grade school, high school, and college. It is a direct frontal assault on Mother Theresa, on Pope John Paul II, on Billy Graham, or every Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish theologian in this Nation. It is a frontal assault on Moses, right before my eyes, on the Jewish rabbi and great lawgiver Mimones over here; it is a frontal assault on the justice code of almost all of the 23 men whose medallions you see up in this Chamber: The Pope, Pope Innocent, Pope Gregory, St. Louis, Pope Alphonse. It is an assault upon every moral code in this country, but it says, there is no more stigma to promiscuity and groping around like alley cats, and any drug- infested party you can go to, and it gets worse. No longer a stigma. Get this next line. I hope you are watching, Evan Thomas. If my office is listening, Mr. Speaker, I hope they call Newsweek because he is in his office this afternoon, and ask Evan Thomas to please turn on the television and listen to this. This is not in quotes, this is Newsweek writing, this is John Leland writing, with the help, and I am going to mention him right now, of Steve Rhodes, contributing in Chicago, Peter Katel in Miami, Claudia Kalb and Marc Peyser in New York, Nadine Joseph in San Francisco, and Martha Brant in Washington, in the Washington office and bureau reports. Get this next line, after there is no stigma: ``More and more of us-- at work * * *'' Is this Newsweek people at work?--at school, in our families, and [[Page H 8718]] in our entertainments--``move comfortably between gay and straight worlds.'' ``Most of us in our work move comfortably between gay and straight worlds and in our schools?'' Then they go to a quote: ``Those of us who are younger,'' says Rebecca Kaplan, 24, a psychology major at Massachusetts Institute of Technology--what are your SAT scores to get into MIT? She says, ``those of us who are younger owe a great deal to gays, lesbians and bisexuals who came before us.'' Who came before us? That is a line for George Washington in his inaugural speech, April 30, 1789. We owe this to Benjamin Franklin and to George Mason up here, we owe it to them, Thomas Payne and those who came before us, those who died at Lexington and Concord, those who suffered during the six and a half years of the Revolutionary War. Any African-American can say, we owe this to those who died in the conflict, to the terrorist John Brown and his sons, we owe it to everybody who came before us, our freedom. What was the greatest scene in the wonderful movie, ``Glory,'' when Morgan Freeman says to the young rebel Denzel Washington, he says, white boys have anted up and died for our freedom; now it is our time to ante up, and he rallies the 4th regiment to go against Fort Wagner, and they gave their lives in the fight for freedom to keep this country. As it says here, tolerance, liberty and union on the other side, those who went before us. ``The bisexuals, lesbians who went before us, we owe it to them.'' She is going to make a great psychologist. Still in school at age 24. She says, ``because of them,'' Rebecca continues, ``I was able to come out as a bisexual and not hate myself.'' Here is this word feminism again, not the lesbian branch of feminism. Feminism has also made romantic attachments between two women--either provisional or lasting-- more acceptable, even privileged. Do you know that I had to be a Congressman approaching my sixties before a young graduate of Holyoke told me that the majority of women at that college would say they were lesbians? That she had to form on campus a heterosexual club to defend themselves. They were not just defending virginity, they were defending normal heterosexuality. And she said, of course, most of the women are 4-year lesbians, or more accurately a 3-year, 9-month lesbian. Peer pressure, sexual lesbian experimentation, and then as, some radical lesbians have said, dripping bile from their lips, they have said, and then the sisters betray us, not in this order necessarily, and go out and get themselves a dog, a station wagon, children and a husband. Is that what Newsweek means by provisional lesbians? Just while they were in college, at a school of higher learning, one of the privileged of the world, to get advanced education beyond high school? Then it says, after privileged, ``as president of the National Organization for Women, Patricia Ireland sets a quiet example.'' She is a big mouth, so what does quiet mean? ``She has both a husband and a female companion.'' What kind of a wimp is her husband down there in Miami that he lets her keep a lesbian roommate up there in Washington, DC. where she does the work of NOW, preparing to send Bella Abzug to rant on in Beijing, China about homophobia? Incredible. And there were some people at NOW that voted against the Nation's most famous lesbian becoming head of NOW. Now, this in Newsweek, and this is in quotes, ``Namely every college or university in the country and some high schools now have gay and lesbian student centers; sex with one's own gender, for anyone who is curious,'' that is you, Mr. Speaker, that is everybody in the gallery, that is these two staffers sitting here, that is our pages, that is me, ``for anyone who is curious, section with one's own gender is now a visible and protected part of campus culture.'' And protected by Newsweek, ladies and gentlemen. Queer studies. I thought queer was a politically incorrect word. ``Queer studies and gender studies are now part of the national curriculum. A popular T- shirt spotted recently in a Connecticut high school puts it this way: Do not assume I am straight.'' That is a high school kid. ``As one 17 year old bi says,'' we do not know if it is a boy or girl, 17 year old, someone over 18 rapes a 17-year-old young lady on a date, that is a statutory rape. This is a minor child that Newsweek is writing about. ``A 17-year-old minor bi says `It is not us versus them anymore. There is just more and more of us.' '' Tim Horing, but there is an umlaut--I did not know Newsweek's typewriters had umlauts over the 0--21, a sophomore--why is he a sophomore at 21? He should be a senior or junior--at City College in San Francisco, describes himself as ``typical of bisexual youth. We just refuse to label ourselves as any of the five food groups.'' That is male heterosexual, female heterosexual, male homosexual, female homosexual, and the bi's. ``We do not want to be any part of the five. We revel in the fuzziness, in the blurred images. Working class, Roman Catholic,'' and, oh, does the New York Times and the networks as CBS did in their CBS reports last night, do they love to attack Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor and the Roman Catholic Church, if they get a Catholic or practicing Baptist family or an orthodox Jewish family, oh, to get somebody from a traditional Jewish or Roman Catholic to switch over and talk about how they are a recovering Catholic or a recovering Jewish person, because of all that terrible confirmation and Holy Communion and bar mitzvah and bat mitzvah, oh, they love to get one of this. And get this, Tom's father is a retired New York narcotics cop. A narco guy taking away another one of their flesh privileges, to get high and then grope out boy for all the warm flesh. ``Horing had his first sexual fantasies about the Bionic Woman, and then in his teens he admitted to himself in a series of difficult steps that he was also attracted to men. He came out to a few friends in school, and at his graduation when his name was called, Timothy Horing, six rows in the auditorium mischievously,'' no, not mischievously, ``yelled out `The bisexual; Tim Horing, the bisexual.' A surprise to his parents.'' No, a gut-ripping heart seizure for his New York retired narcotics cop and his Roman Catholic mother. ``For the most part, he has been in monogamous relationships.'' You like that, ``for the most part?'' ``Usually with men.'' Oh, I see. I always said for my entire life that bisexuality was basically a cover story for homosexuality. That when they captured the adjective ``gay'' to say that they were happier than your average pair, more cheerful, more mirthful, that then, if they said they were bisexual, they could say ``Well, I date the whole base. I can date anybody on Capitol Hill. I am a switch-hitter. I am AC-DC, I am bi. I can go for anything. You are missing out on half the world.'' But we find out he basically dates men. As we go all the way through this, most of it is male homosexuality, not bisexuality. Though he is now dating two gay men and a bisexual woman. I see. He is spreading himself around. Two homosexual men and one half-homosexual woman. What would that give him in the rating of chess pieces? What would that make him, 87.75 homosexual? He says, young Tom, ``I never wanted a white picket fence, but I do want someone I can settle down with and raise my Benetton kids.'' Benetton. Is that the Benetton Colors out of Italy that put Ronald Reagan in major news magazines with cancer, sarcoma, AIDS sores all over his face? Is this Benetton that pushes homosexual money into every corner of America and everywhere else their clothing is marketed? I notice that the Justice Department today under Janet Reno is investigating Calvin Klein jeans to see if they used underaged children in their soft core pornography, latest wave of disgusting ads, and Klein, unless he gets taken to court, is laughing all the way to the bank again, because negative soft- or hard-core pornography sells in modern America. They just had an adult bookstore convention in the Sheraton Universal Hotel in Los Angeles, and I am reading in one of my Los Angeles Times clippings that the business, in spite of the January 17 earthquake 2 years ago, has rebounded and doubled. You do not see porno theaters in your markets anymore, because it is in all the hotels for traveling businessmen to demean somebody else's sister, wife, somebody else's daughter, who did not have the [[Page H 8719]] love of a father, and it is in all the video stores, including Blockbuster. The ripping apart of these young gals from these transitional neighborhoods who never new the loving touch, the moral touch, of a father, to hug them and kiss them and guide them through school. They are out there as the young whores of our society being used by the porno industry. And no matter how many commit suicide like Karen Applegate from a beautiful little town in Wisconsin.--I have spoken to her mother. No matter how many kill themselves. Six playmates have killed themselves over the years. When I asked Hugh Hefner that once to his face, he turned red and did not want to discuss it and said it was a lie. I knew them each by name, starting with Marilyn Monroe, his first playmate. {time} 1400 But this guy says he wants to raise his Benetton kids in a swinging orgy household. His partner may be a man or woman, he says. I don't feel forced to choose. I don't have to make any tough choices. Then it shows this very pathetic human being with his baby. He has gone through every orgy situation available to the humankind. And when people ask him what his little baby is, man or woman, he says ask the baby. He has a little boy or girl and he says, ask the baby. Smart aleck. Pray for him. He is 42 and he has three or four people on the hook. It goes on and on as it gets worse. Softening tensions. Softening tensions. This is Newsweek. That is a paragraph title. For many bisexuals, it has not been easy. When I came out in '88, says Melissa Merry, 31, energetic Chicagoan who calls herself Mel: I was told by people from local lesbian support groups not to come out as a bisexual or I would be asked to leave. They did not want the fence straddling. Well, when I got to some of these paragraphs about high schools, the first thing that flashed in my mind, as an Irish-American, was William B. Yeats poem read when Hitler started World War II. And he died that year, Yeats. It is called ``The Second Coming,'' about the beast being born, the Antichrist and slouching off to Bethlehem to be born. Those are the last lines, but it begins turning and turning in the widening gyre, as in gyrations, falcons, circle. Turning and turning in the widening gyre, the falcon no longer hears the falconer. Things fall apart. The center cannot hold. Everywhere the blood din tide is loosed. Everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned. The ceremony of innocence is drowned by Newsweek. The best lack all conviction and the worst are full of passionate intensity. There is an intensity to this article and it is evil and it is the worst. When I saw in here they are claiming James Dean, the actor who died at age 24 after only three movies, when I see they are claiming Marlene Dietrich as a bisexual lesbian, and Cary Grant, my favorite actor as a young man because of everybody's favorite movie quote-unquote ``Gunga Din,'' when I saw that, I went to the end to see how many women participated in--what is the author's name again, with John Leland in this disgusting, vile piece--and while I was back at the tail end of the article reading all the violence--by the way, if this were in Time we would not know who contributed to this. I could not call any of these people and say have you lost your moral compass totally at this magazine? Does Donald Graham read this, this cover story of this corruption, this drowning of innocence? And as I was reading, I decided I would look before I finished the story at the last line. Now, let me tell you a story about myself personally. When I was a young man in Beverly Hills, just out of high school, and I heard these rumors, because my uncle is the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz, Jack Haley, I grew up in that community. I knew who dodged the draft. I knew the heroes who went off to combat, like James Stewart and Tyrone Power. We know who all the ones that were rumored to be homosexuals. I knew about Rock Hudson 10 years before it came out in the press. I had a small bit part in a movie ``Gathering of Eagles,'' and he minced across the set and the director said cut. And Rock turned around and said was I mincing too much? And the director said, just do it again, Rock. I witnessed that, and everybody talks behind the scenes. Just as in fashion design, in ice skating, in supernumeraries, on Broadway stage, in ballet, and now in some parts of government there is a larger percentage than the 1 percent of homosexuals out there across America. And when I worked on the sets of Hollywood trying to feed my five children and dreaming about running for Congress someday, I had long philosophical discussions with a lot of young homosexual men in their 20's, and they would tell me about Rock and all the stars that they just were dying to get with some night; wanted them, and then to see them up there 50 feet high up on the silver screen and know that you had sexually been with them. What a trip. And how did I rationalize Cary Grant when I was in high school? I remember working out a rationale that when God gives you a lot of talent and you make a lot of money in your 20's or 30's--what did Robin Williams say after he came off cocaine and watched his friend John Belushi die? He said cocaine is God's way of telling you you are making too much money. It was the same way in Hollywood. Always has been. Or in any profession where money flows fast into the hands of the young. Look at all our rock stars. Look at Kurt Cobain blowing his brains out. Look at Jerry Garcia. Look at Marilyn Monroe. Look at Elvis. Look at Jimi Hendrix. Look at Jim Morrison. Look at Janis Joplin. Whether it is booze or heroin or drugs, and orgies for all of them. I watched Elvis Presley using his staff to pimp for him. I thought what a tragedy for this polite young man from Tupelo, MI. I am trying to sell him a script called the 101st American, about Vietnam, because he had served honorably in the Army, and I am watching his staff hit on young pretty extra girls for him. They rented a big mansion up in Beverly Hills below the head of the owner of the L.A. Rams, who is now dead, and you could hear the orgies going on all night long. He died naked, on drugs at 42 years of age, and now you can get a postage stamp and lick Elvis and stick him on your letter and say there went the most talented man in rock singing in our lifetime dead at 42. And in that suite of stamps you can get Marilyn Monroe. Do we forget how old she was in August of 1962 when she died? 36 years old. 36 years old! At my age, that is a kid. We are celebrating these two deaths with their most glamorous picture. Remember the debate in the Post Office department: Do we want the fat, older drug besotted Elvis or the younger Elvis in his prime? We picked the younger one. And he was a polite young man. What a tragedy! So I watched all these people corrupting themselves, and I watched others, like Jimmy Stewart and my Uncle Jack and others. I remember Danny Thomas telling me I have never told a dirty joke in my life, Bob. Do not ever forget that. My uncle told me, never stoop to dirty humor on the stage. It is too easy to get laughs. Today I watch all these comedians. It is a category with the medical word for male organ. That is all they do, are jokes on genitalia. It is sickening what is going on in Hollywood. But what was my rationale for Cary Grant? Here it was, I remember it vividly, I was in my teens. I said when you have too much money, and you can have any beautiful woman in the world, and you start going to wild Hollywood parties and drinking too much--we did not know about drugs much in those days--and you start drinking too much, and you are at an orgy, whatever moves, I guess. It is all a mortal sin. It is all promiscuity. It is all flesh. Flesh is flesh, so you experiment with everything. So I do not think Cary Grant was a homosexual or a bisexual. He just got carried away at those orgies. That was my rationale so I could like Sergeant McChesney of Gunga Din with McLaglen and with Sergeant Ballentine Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Years later, in a debate running for the Senate seat that Pete Wilson eventually won, I am debating one of the candidates back in the pack, because I am still back in the pack in the Presidential race, he was a State senator, he was raised as a German-American [[Page H 8720]] Roman Catholic, he was a colonel in the Marine Reserve, and I pointed out to him in a radio debate in 1982 at a station in Pasadena, KRLA-- how is that for a memory--I said, you know something my State Senate friend, reaching out and grabbing any kind of flesh, whether heterosexual or homosexual, lust is lust. It is one of the seven deadly sins. It is all a mortal sin whether normal or abnormal. He went ballistic. Would not accept that. Then I found out he had a scandal brewing. He had two college students where he taught as a professor, a marine officer, who were pregnant with children out of wedlock. He bragged, quite properly, at least he was pro-life. I could not understand why he took such exception to saying that God is not going to judge a promiscuous homosexual any more harshly than he will judge a promiscuous heterosexual. It is all lust. It is all the ceremony of innocence being drowned as we do this to our children. So there it is, when I am a teenager rationalizing Cary Grant and arguing on a radio show in a California Senate race in 1982. Here is my point for telling those two little tangential tales. My eyes jump above all the bylines of these people, Steve and Peter and Claudia and Mark and Nadine and Martha, and here is the last line of this disgusting, vile, decadent piece from the Graham empire of the Washington Post Newsweek magazine and other small newspapers. It says in the last paragraph, in San Francisco recently Tim Horing-- remember him, Roman Catholic, parents retired New York narco cop father--he was telling his friends about how he changed his approach to picking up boys. How old was Horing? 21. Hey, Newsweek, did you slip here in your investigative reporting? Telling his friends how he had changed his approach to pick up boys? Is he a 21-year-old chicken hawk hitting on runaway young men on the street who also, in most cases, until recently, when peer pressure overwhelms even good attentive Jewish Christian mothers and fathers. In the old days, last year, last decade, it was young boys who never knew a father's masculine touch, a mother's hug, a mom or dad taking them to a baseball game or fishing. It was young men who ran away from inattentive alcoholic families that ended up on the street of once glamorous Hollywood Boulevard to be preyed upon, P-R-E-Y-E-D upon, to be taken off for porno films and turned into midnight cowboy male street whores all along Selma Boulevard behind beautiful Jesuit Blessed Sacrament Church in Hollywood. I drove down that street when I did Michael Reagan's show a month ago, and there they are, still huddling in the driveways with less business because now most of them are infected with AIDS. So Tim Horing--I have to check if he was 21. Yes, he is 21. He says the boys that I pick up now--he has changed his approach. ``I used to say are you queer? Then I switched to, do you like boys? Now his favorite line is, do you like me?'' As he sees it, ``I have gone from the political to the historical attraction to the very personal. All that matters is if they like me.'' This is the new bisexual moment, Newsweek says. This is their close in a nutshell. And I close with this line, Mr. Speaker. ``Hard fought, hard thought, and distinctively individual. It is a thorny narrative, fraught with questions of identity and belonging. And in the end, it is really about the simple, mysterious pull between warm human bodies when the lights go out.'' My teenage rationale for Cary Grant. We are in advanced moral decay, Mr. Speaker, and I am going to stay in the Presidential race as long as I can, because there is not anyone in the race like Congressman Robert K. Dornan at age 62. ",https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/9/8/house-section/article/h8714-1?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22croatian%22%2C%22croatian%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1429,REPORT OF FACTFINDING TRIP,"Mr. DORNAN. Mr. Speaker, we have had a fast 3 days. Started late on Wednesday, finishing early today. Pressure is building up here for a major budgetary struggle between the two major, only major parties in the world's only superpower, on all of these budgetary issues. We have come back from a long, what we sometimes euphemistically call a district work period. We are supposed to cram in a vacation and work hard. For some of us, it is hard work. I took one of the more difficult and fast-moving factfinding trips of my career, now that I am one of only two double chairmen out of all 435 Members of this Chamber. I chair a Subcommittee on Intelligence, the Subcommittee on Technical and Tactical Intelligence, and I chair the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, which becomes the most important of all 5 military subcommittees under the Committee on National Security, what used to be called Armed Services, and is still called Armed Services in the House of Lords or the other Chamber, the Senate. On this trip, in discussing the issues with new young enlisted men, senior sergeants, petty officers, and the officer corps at all levels, up to and including four-star admirals, at Naples, at the major air base that is in command of all the bombing missions going on as we speak over poor torn ripped Bosnia-Herzegovina. And at Brendezy, down at the coast at the very heel of the Italian peninsula. That is where we have our Navy Seals, where we have what was a major listening post base. In all the world, there are only five listening to everything, San Vito Air Station, using the international airport at Brendezy where we keep our AC-130 Hercules special mission Spectre gun ships. I met with all the crews there. It is still classified whether or not they are going in at night over Bosnia. These were the aircraft that if we had them in Somalia over Mogadishu, we would have saved a dozen or more lives of our best trained Army special forces and Delta Force, Rangers and 160th Aviation Regiment, special armed squadrons. Then I traveled with Congressman Greg Laughlin, the highest ranking active reservist in the House or the Senate, of Galveston, TX, and we went to Slovenia. A fascinating, brand-new country in the world. It never had nation status, let alone a seat in the United Nations since the dissolution of the Communist country of the former Yugoslavia. {time} 1315 Then we went down to Croatia, met with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's special representative to all of the problems in former Yugoslavia, Mr., that is his formal title, Mr. Sasushi Akashi, met with him at the U.N. headquarters, the blue helmet home plate in Zagreb, then went down along the Dalmatian coast, drove slowly through all of the destruction wreaked upon one of the world's most beautiful coastlines, looks for all the world like the California coastline between Santa Barbara and Monterey--just torn apart. The international airport in Zadar utterly destroyed except for the runways, all of the international terminal buildings, hollow shells of aluminum, like a nuclear explosion went off, the tower, all the windows shot out with AK-47's by the retreating Bosnian soldiers. They almost cut Croatia in half at that point, Zadar. Then we went down to Macedonia, met with all of our American tripwire forces out in the front outposts along the border, flew on white helicopters, UH-60 Blackhawks that, of course, called themselves the Whitehawks, with the United Nations stenciled on the sides, went out to these American outposts, studied this poor city of Skopje, which had been destroyed by an earthquake in 1963. It has never really made it back to a stable, functioning city, still great pockets of poverty from that horrible earthquake in 1963. Then we flew over to Albania, one of the most godforsaken but still physically beautiful countries in the world, and met with the president there, Sali Berisha, Mr. Berisha; he is a European renowned heart surgeon. His wife is a renowned doctor of pediatrics, a child doctor. What a lucky country to go from the depths of communism with a paranoidal maniac, Enver Hoxna, one of the last psychotic, paranoid Communist dictators in the world, who literally took this beautiful country of Albania, a brand new country created after World War I, not a traditional nation on the face of the Earth, and just drove it into the ground, more than a half-century of locked-up paranoia and total Communist psychotic oppression, and now they have a wonderful president who said to me and to the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Laughlin], although he wants to be in the United Nations and would like to be accepted into NATO, he does not care what happens in the world if he just has the friendship of the United States, just one on one, unilateral friendship, and he thinks Albania will make it into the 21st century. That is the identical message we got north of there in another one of the eight parts of Yugoslavia that have spun off in Solvenia, same message: ``U.S. friendship is what we want.'' In Albania, we looked at what was supposed to be a top-secret program [[Page H 8715]] and is now written about in all newspapers, the Predator, unmanned aerial vehicle [UAV] program. The pilots at that base, both Albanian and our U.S. Forces there, took us in a cave that the Chinese carved out of a mountain, a cave as long as several football fields, and there I looked at 24 or 25 MiG aircraft from the vintage of when I flew almost 40 years ago. There were MiG-19, ``Farmer'' was our NATO codeword, jets that they still fly, that were Russia's response to my F-100 Supersabre, and older jets from Korea, MiG Alley, early 1950's, MiG-15's and MiG-17's, the kind of airplane my colleague, the gentleman from California [Mr. Cunningham], shot down in North Vietnam. At least of his five victories, three are MiG-17's, all of this in this giant tunnel. And the landscape of the country is scarred, marred with 700,000 to 1 million concrete bunkers, pillboxes, machine gun posts, some of them as big as the entire rostrum of this House, others as big as from here to the other lectern, a million of them, maybe, making the whole landscape look ugly, and there is no money to remove them or drag them out to the sea and make a breakwater for a small boat harbor on this beautiful Dalmatian coast of the Adriatic. On that trip, at every stop I would take off my chairman's hat from intelligence and put on my chairman's hat from military personnel and ask our men and women at all levels of command what it will take to keep them in the military, to keep that expensive training that they were given to melt down the evil empire of the Soviet Union and stand guard over freedom and be part of the world's only superpower, and everywhere they talked about family, and quality of life; they spoke of what it would take them to earn a proper living with groceries, their compensation. So, all around that hot area of the world, I saw again that America is so lucky, as Ronald Reagan used to quote James Michener's great fictitious, but more fact than fiction, novel from the Korean war, ``The Bridges of Toko-Ri,'' ``Where do we get such men,'' and now we can say women, ``Where do we get such men and women?'' How are we so lucky as to have them serve us? The sad thing about this break, Mr. Speaker, is that we went through some of the greatest anniversaries with the House adjourned. The 50th anniversary of the end of the greatest crusade for freedom against tyranny in all of recorded history during our break, the 50th anniversary endings. We had adjourned by the time Sunday came up for the 50th anniversary of the bombing at Hiroshima; 3 days later Nagasaki, August 9. On August 15 in the Pacific, on the other side of the dateline, August 14 here, the end of shooting in the Second World War; not really so; Japanese imperial warload staff beheaded prisoners, shot them, killed all the prisoners at Unit 371 in Pingfan, outside of Mukden, Manchuria. They called these godforsaken human beings ``logs,'' to depersonalize them. They had shot them, amputated all four of their limbs, one at a time, let them recover from each amputation, training over a thousand doctors to go out to all the tentacles of the imperial octopus that was so abusing the whole eastern perimeter, western perimeter of the Pacific around Asia. They had boiled them to death to see what it was like. They had frozen them to death. They had tied them to trees and hit them with bombs and shrapnel and grenades. They had put flamethrowers on them. They had infected them with anthrax, all forms of biological warfare, and none of these people that I know of were brought to justice. That is why everybody is so grateful to the current Prime Minister of Japan, that he offered an apology that we cannot get out of their congress, their ``diet,'' but there were men killed after August 15 over there, and August 14 here. Many prisoners died. My friend, Jack Singlaub, was parachuted in with a small OSS team to the Chinese island of Hainan, under Japanese warload control. Notice I say ``warlord,'' to distinguish ourselves from the free democracy of Japan today, and it was mostly, it was all Australian and New Zealand prisoners, no Americans there. He loaded them on trains from this prison camp on the western side of Hainan island and took them over to the biggest port on the eastern side, and five or six Australian and New Zealand prisoners died on that train, but at least they died as free men. That was a very rough 2-week period. All of the prisoners were under death orders. If the United States invasion forces of Operation Olympic had set foot on the Japanese home islands, all prisoners were to be executed. Many were beheaded and beaten to death in the streets of Japanese cities if they were unfortunate enough to bail out over their target. Many of them miraculously survived. War crimes trials in Japan, but far less than those that were brought to the bar of justice, Hitler's war criminals. So we passed through all of those anniversaries without a word on this House floor, because we were out. Then came V-J Day. I decided I would spend V-J Day at our airbases encircling tortured Bosnia rather than be in Hawaii, where I planned to be and was invited to go with a World War II veteran, a young-looking gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Stump. I wanted to be on that trip, but I was so offended by the photo opportunities of the White House at the Normandy beaches to the exclusion of some of our heroes when they should have been the focus, that I did not want to subject myself to that, and I would have been pained to hear Mr. Clinton call the U.S.S. Missouri, the battleship upon which the Japanese surrender terms were unconditionally signed on September 2, 1945, I would have been pained to hear Mr. Clinton call it a carrier, an aircraft carrier. I would have been pained to hear him refer to the front of the ship, the bow, as the bow, as in a bow in your hair, and I guess he would call the stern the back side of the ship. If that had been Vice President Dan Quayle making verbal mistakes like that, you would all know about it. It would be headlines. But people are probably listening to C-SPAN today, 1,300,000 who think I am making that up. No, Mr. Clinton actually said those things, aircraft carrier Missouri, bow of it, as in bow and arrow, the bow of the ship. He got away with it. I preferred to be out with the troops in the field rather than at those wonderful closing ceremonies. But now a word here on the floor, Mr. Speaker. Here is what has been painful to me over the last 4 years: Except for the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. Montgomery], two-star general, retired in the Army, of the Montgomery GI bill fame, and the aforementioned gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Stump], Navy retiree, except for one 1-hour special order that they did on Iwo Jima, there has not been a single memorial on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives or the United States Senate for any single 50-year anniversary of anything that happened all during World War II, not Pearl Harbor, not the fall of Bataan, or the Bataan death march, not Corredigor, not the comeback at Guadalcanal, not the landings in Tarawa, not the Dieppe raid along the coast of Hitler's fortress Europe, not Al Alamein, not the battles at Tobruk, not the Kasserine Pass, not the landings at Sicily in July 9, 1943; we have heard here in July 1993, not Salerno, not Anzio, not Operation Overlord on D-Day, not Operation Dragon down on the southern coast of France, nothing about Okinawa, which came after Iwo Jima or the Gilbert Islands or Marshall Islands or the Battle of the Coral Sea or the Battle of Midway or the Battle of the Solomon Islands or the Santa Cruz Islands, nothing for 4 years in the Senate or the House floor pausing for a series of 1-minute speeches or 1-minute special orders. I am not saying this to pat myself on the back; except for about 10 of my 1-hour special orders, nothing, nothing on this House floor. I remember an Oklahoma Congressman shut this place down. I remember it because he lost his primary a few months later. I wondered if there was a connection. I think his name was Congressman Risenhoover. He shut this place down. We filled it with potted palms, and on Flag Day, June 14 in some late year in the late 1970's, I forget the year, we had the great western singers, June Carter and Johnny Cash, standing up there. We sang patriotic hymns, and we did Flag Day, and there was nothing special. It was not the 50th anniversary of Flag Day, or silver anniversary. It was just Flag Day, any June 14. The whole place shut down, palms, [[Page H 8716]] potted plants all over at every entrance. I have never seen the like of it, potted plants all around the front here. We do not do that for a State of the Union with the Commander in Chief standing up there. We did not do that for Douglas MacArthur or Winston Churchill the two times he stood up there. {time} 1330 I thought, ``Wow, we are going to do this, I guess, all during World War II. Am I lucky to be here.'' And, when George Bush got elected, because I went with President Bush to Pearl Harbor's 50th anniversary, and we stood there on that memorial across the midships of the U.S.S. Arizona, still a ship of the line, with the flag run up at reveille every morning. I thought, ``This is going to be great, go through all these 50-year anniversaries with a 58 combat mission Navy attack carrier pilot in the White House.'' And instead we ended up with someone who had avoided the draft three times, has insulted the military over, and over, and over with photo opportunities, using them to try to up his ratings, and thank God it fails every time, and here we are, past September 2, 1995, 50 years gone by. No memorials. Today I have an editorial, a counter-editorial, in the USA Today. They always put in the left-right views. They called my office at 2 o'clock yesterday, said, ``Give us something quick. Senator Warner is not responding fast enough, the No. 2 man on Armed Services Committee in the other body.'' They said, ``Give us something on why the military should be built up.'' We pumped out something quickly. I sent a corrected copy on a fax to USA Today at 3:30, and I said, ``Well, this will be in next week,'' and it is in this morning, a turnaround of about 15 hours before it hit the streets, and I would like to read it, Mr. Speaker. It says, ``Military Needs Buildup.'' It is what every one of these young, not-so-young, people all around the Mediterranean told me. ``Robert K. Dornan, opposing view: The military budget has been hit year after year. Security demands that we spend more.'' Now I have not read the USA Today house editorial that says we must gut defense even more, but here is my response on September 8: ``After 11 straight years of defense spending cuts, Republicans are providing the national security leadership not found in the current administration. ``Indeed, President Clinton's draconian defense budget would produce another Carter-era ``hollow force'' reportedly underfunded by as much as $150 billion. Congress, therefore, is not squandering money when it votes to increase the Pentagon's budget by $7 billion more than requested. Instead, it is restoring national security funding to necessary levels. ``How soon we forget what is required to quickly and decisively win on the modern battlefield. ``Today's military modernization is tomorrow's combat readiness. Systems such as the F-117 `Nighthawk' stealth fighter and the Patriot missile were not developed overnight. They were the culmination of years of research and development. These revolutionary systems drastically reduced our casualties'' killed in acting and wounded in action) ``in Desert Storm.'' more than any other conflict in history given the level of lethality, and violence, and speed, and maneuverability. ``Today we can improve upon these systems with new weapons that will further reduce the risk to American troops. ``The B-2 `Spirit' Stealth bomber,'' I helped to name that, so of course I want to get the name in, ``carries eight times the payload of the F-117, with greater range and crew survivability.'' Keep in mind, listening audience, Mr. Speaker, and my colleagues who may be packing up their bags in their offices to head back to their districts, that the B-2 survived in this Chamber by 3 votes, 213 to 210, to defeat an amendment, mostly by people who have never served in the military, to kill and shut down the world's only bomber production line, the B-2 ``Spirit.'' ``New missile defense programs, such as the upgraded Navy Aegis (A-e- g-i-s) system, provide greater range, accuracy, and coverage than Patriot missiles.'' We call that upper-tier Navy defense. Put two ships off Israel, two ships off Korea, just two ships, and the footprint from both those ships can keep Israel free from being struck with a nuclear weapon or, as we now find out from the defecting son-in-law of dictator, mad-dog killer Saddam Hussein; we now find out that, yes, they were driving to completion of a nuclear weapon and were playing around with the most deadly biological, and chemical, and nerve gas weapons since World War II and would have used them, and may have used them; the jury is out on that. So we need this Navy upper-tier Aegis system antimissile defense. ``Does the Pentagon need these expensive new programs? Ask the Air Force pilots who will not have to attack highly defended enemy targets in vulnerable, unstealthy aircraft because they will have the B-2. Ask the Marines and Army troops who will not have to worry about Scud ballistic missile attacks because of the Navy's new ballistic missile defense.'' All of this, of course, predicated upon the conference between the House and the Senate, the conference process that we are entering, that we entered this afternoon. My R&D Subcommittee is meeting as I speak. I decided that letting America know what we are doing was more important than participating in that meeting because I am not the chairman of that subcommittee; the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Weldon] is. My close in today's USA Today: ``These and other Republican initiatives in areas such as personnel and training will not just maintain, but will enhance, the combat capability that has so quickly deteriorated under Clinton's leadership. ``Those of us who visit,'' as I did in the Balkans over this break our troops, ``and listen to our front-line troops are giving them what they need,'' what they deserve, ``including equipment that will drastically reduce loss of'' precious, ``life.'' ``The Reagan revolution of the 1980's laid the foundation for'' the victory in, ``Desert Storm. The Republican revolution'' that started on November 8, ``of 1994 is laying the foundation for any future victories, if that is our fate, and the survival of U.S. combat troops well into the 21st century.'' Now, Mr. Speaker, I had intended to spend the better part of this hour special order on defense on some of the votes that we won this week. We won them all on the conservative side with the help of many conservative members of the former majority party, the oldest political party in America, the Democrats, but last night I kept a promise that I made to a Navy Seal at Brandezy, Italy. I do not want to identify him by rank, but let us put it this way. All the Seal's in the Mediterranean depend on this fine young officer and Annapolis graduate from decades ago. He said to me, ``Congressman Dornan, I appreciate you being in the Presidential race, although it appears you don't have much chance of victory, as I appreciate Mr. Keyes, Alan Keyes, of Maryland, because you discuss the moral issues which I believe are the critical issues of our time.'' Now keep in mind this is a senior naval officer trained to the peak of physical and mental performance for his country. He said, ``Congressman, I believe as a naval officer that the military culture is the last stable part of American life from which we can begin the rebuilding of our Nation's moral fiber, from which we can begin to defend the moral and cultural ethos that is collapsing around us.'' Now I would like to think there is a pocket of us on both sides of the aisle in the House and the Senate that also believe that we are in an advanced state of moral decline in our country. He said to me, this naval officer, ``Did you see the cover story of Newsweek in July on bissexuality?'' I said, ``No, captain, I did not.'' He said, ``Well, I canceled my subscription with a long letter to the New York publisher and senior editors saying that this was the most vile and corrupt article I've ever seen in my life.'' And I said, ``Well, every week in my office I get 10 magazines and about 10 newspapers,'' and I said, ``I try to read as much as any human being in the [[Page H 8717]] House or Senate. With all due immodesty, I've never seen anybody that reads more.'' And I said, ``I did not see this particular Newsweek. I can go weeks without even catching a cover story in Time, or Newsweek, or U.S. News and World Report, or all the other magazines that we get. Then there is all the great conservative publications, the moderate ones like New Republic I try to stay up with, and Crisis, and First Things, and cutting edge of Catholic and Protestant, conservative, magazines, and of course Bill Buckley, my old pal, with National Review--awful lot to read. We have tremendous responsibility here to stay informed on what our Speaker Gingrich calls the ``information highway'' to be an alert, informed man or woman in this place. It is an overwhelming job if you're trying to inform yourself of all aspects of the popular culture and try to cover the economic front, the foreign affairs front, the human rights front, the defense front, all the social issues at home, gang warfare, the O.J. Simpson trial, not as a gawking ``Lookie Lou,'' but as someone aware that this trial, as the Menendez trial has done, can put our whole jury system in jeopardy.'' And I promised this Navy SEAL that I would get the Newsweek article out of my huge piles of reading material in my office and take a look at it. I have only been home since the first of September. I got it out last night and read it. Here it is, Mr. Speaker. It is the Newsweek issue of July 17, so it hit the newsstands on Monday, July 10. I read it last night, and I agree with this naval officer, assigned at a forward base in Italy, a kind of a man who will go in and put his life on the line if another Captain Scott O'Grady gets shot down along the coast. The Navy SEAL's will have the job to go in and rescue them under fire, and I agree with this naval officer. This is the most corrupt article, let alone a cover story, that I have ever read in an American magazine in my life--Newsweek. The Washington bureau chief, and we are having our problems right now over another issue that personally involves my honor, and I will do a 1-hour special order or a personal privilege in the middle of the day-- no, I would not do that in September, budget month--to defend my honor from an attack by a reporter who has only been--who was not even hired when this issue came out, who attacked my honor and said I crashed four aircraft in the Air Force. I have not crashed one. Ejected twice from totally out-of-control aircraft, but he doubled that to four and said I crashed them and said I was a black ace, one kind of black ace. The only black aces I know were an F-14 squadron called the ``Black Aces'' in the unheralded until the HBO special in the last few weeks, the 99th fighter squadron, and then the 332nd Fighter Group, the Tuskegee airmen, our young fighter pilots in the Italian theatre of African- American heritage who are finally getting their recognition 52 years after they entered combat. That is the only ``Black Aces'' I know about. But I am having my problems with Evan Thomas, who I think is one of the better talking heads. He will be on television tomorrow, on a program called ``Inside U.S.A.,'' a handsome young man, and we are having out problems on this, but I have not talked to him about this issue, and I will. I am going to fly up to New York. I am going to go see Donald and Katharine Graham. She is chairman emeritus and has discussed this issue. I almost wonder if I can read this in the Chamber, but listen to this. I wish you folks were not leaving up there because--well, get the Congressional Record tomorrow and read this. Here is the article on bisexuality. It is under ``Lifestyle,'' of course. ``Bisexuality is the wild card of our erotic life. Now it is coming out in the open, in pop culture, in cyberspace, and on campus. But can you really have it both ways?'' They asked rhetorically, question mark, by John Leland. The answer is Newsweek thinks you can because in this article, one of America's great magazines--when I was a little kid coming out of St. Patrick's, I used to look at their beautiful headquarters building right there on Fifth Avenue across from Tiffany somewhere. Newsweek, which is owned by the Washington Post, one of America's three major newspapers, all of them liberal: L.A. Times, New York Times, Washington Post. They own this, so it is under Katharine and Donald Graham. Here is what Newsweek says about this issue. Brace yourself for culture shock if you are still shockable. They show here Theresa, and Ronelle, all these couples, Stephen and Linda. Of course, she's 47 and he's 30. They all have multiple partners, they all switch-hit, they are all AC/DC, they are dual- gaited. I remember all the cute words in New York, and, after all, I grew up in Manhattan and then west to Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, so I know all the flippant dialog. {time} 1345 Here is a woman, 48, with a young Hispanic guy, it looks like he is about 17, 18, 19; he is in his early 20's. Freud said we are all bisexual. He thought that exclusive heterosexuality was a problem. In the copy it says that he thought homosexuality was a problem, and he never got around to that, because he died and met God before he had a chance to get into that. But the article goes on, and by its commentary, approving of this fifth gender. Bella Abzug stands up in Beijing, China, in the middle of the world's most oppressive human rights, communistic dictatorship and mentions homophobia and gets a standing ovation from all of the assembled feminists of the world. if Ms. Hillary was in the room, she would have given her a standing ovation. So here in the picture of this blue-eyed, red-headed guy, Tim, 24, with Ellen, 30 years of age. She has done it all, it is always older women and younger guys in these bisexual things. Listen to this. ``The bisexual blip of the 1970's was an offshoot of the sexual revolution.'' Of course, Newsweek's position is the sexual revolution was just grand. Tell that to 200,000 people dead of AIDS, another million infected in this country, and 10 to 20 million affected all around the world. Make love, casual sex like alley cats, not war. So they refer to the sexual revolution in an approving way. ``The bisexual blip was an offshoot of that revolution. It was straight with a twist. By contrast, the current bisexual movement rises from the gay and feminists movements.'' Notice it did not say lesbian wing of the feminist movement, just the feminist movement. ``For a generation that came of age during the gay rights movement, same-sex relationships or experiments no longer carry the stigma they once did.'' Stigma. What would that mean? Would that mean sin? Right and wrong, evil, banal sin, mortal sin? Newsweek magazine, with this article, Mr. Speaker, and anybody listening, make no mistake about it, Newsweek magazine, with this July 17 cover story, is a direct frontal attack on everything that I was ever taught by my parents, by every teacher I had in grade school, high school, and college. It is a direct frontal assault on Mother Theresa, on Pope John Paul II, on Billy Graham, or every Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish theologian in this Nation. It is a frontal assault on Moses, right before my eyes, on the Jewish rabbi and great lawgiver Mimones over here; it is a frontal assault on the justice code of almost all of the 23 men whose medallions you see up in this Chamber: The Pope, Pope Innocent, Pope Gregory, St. Louis, Pope Alphonse. It is an assault upon every moral code in this country, but it says, there is no more stigma to promiscuity and groping around like alley cats, and any drug- infested party you can go to, and it gets worse. No longer a stigma. Get this next line. I hope you are watching, Evan Thomas. If my office is listening, Mr. Speaker, I hope they call Newsweek because he is in his office this afternoon, and ask Evan Thomas to please turn on the television and listen to this. This is not in quotes, this is Newsweek writing, this is John Leland writing, with the help, and I am going to mention him right now, of Steve Rhodes, contributing in Chicago, Peter Katel in Miami, Claudia Kalb and Marc Peyser in New York, Nadine Joseph in San Francisco, and Martha Brant in Washington, in the Washington office and bureau reports. Get this next line, after there is no stigma: ``More and more of us-- at work * * *'' Is this Newsweek people at work?--at school, in our families, and [[Page H 8718]] in our entertainments--``move comfortably between gay and straight worlds.'' ``Most of us in our work move comfortably between gay and straight worlds and in our schools?'' Then they go to a quote: ``Those of us who are younger,'' says Rebecca Kaplan, 24, a psychology major at Massachusetts Institute of Technology--what are your SAT scores to get into MIT? She says, ``those of us who are younger owe a great deal to gays, lesbians and bisexuals who came before us.'' Who came before us? That is a line for George Washington in his inaugural speech, April 30, 1789. We owe this to Benjamin Franklin and to George Mason up here, we owe it to them, Thomas Payne and those who came before us, those who died at Lexington and Concord, those who suffered during the six and a half years of the Revolutionary War. Any African-American can say, we owe this to those who died in the conflict, to the terrorist John Brown and his sons, we owe it to everybody who came before us, our freedom. What was the greatest scene in the wonderful movie, ``Glory,'' when Morgan Freeman says to the young rebel Denzel Washington, he says, white boys have anted up and died for our freedom; now it is our time to ante up, and he rallies the 4th regiment to go against Fort Wagner, and they gave their lives in the fight for freedom to keep this country. As it says here, tolerance, liberty and union on the other side, those who went before us. ``The bisexuals, lesbians who went before us, we owe it to them.'' She is going to make a great psychologist. Still in school at age 24. She says, ``because of them,'' Rebecca continues, ``I was able to come out as a bisexual and not hate myself.'' Here is this word feminism again, not the lesbian branch of feminism. Feminism has also made romantic attachments between two women--either provisional or lasting-- more acceptable, even privileged. Do you know that I had to be a Congressman approaching my sixties before a young graduate of Holyoke told me that the majority of women at that college would say they were lesbians? That she had to form on campus a heterosexual club to defend themselves. They were not just defending virginity, they were defending normal heterosexuality. And she said, of course, most of the women are 4-year lesbians, or more accurately a 3-year, 9-month lesbian. Peer pressure, sexual lesbian experimentation, and then as, some radical lesbians have said, dripping bile from their lips, they have said, and then the sisters betray us, not in this order necessarily, and go out and get themselves a dog, a station wagon, children and a husband. Is that what Newsweek means by provisional lesbians? Just while they were in college, at a school of higher learning, one of the privileged of the world, to get advanced education beyond high school? Then it says, after privileged, ``as president of the National Organization for Women, Patricia Ireland sets a quiet example.'' She is a big mouth, so what does quiet mean? ``She has both a husband and a female companion.'' What kind of a wimp is her husband down there in Miami that he lets her keep a lesbian roommate up there in Washington, DC. where she does the work of NOW, preparing to send Bella Abzug to rant on in Beijing, China about homophobia? Incredible. And there were some people at NOW that voted against the Nation's most famous lesbian becoming head of NOW. Now, this in Newsweek, and this is in quotes, ``Namely every college or university in the country and some high schools now have gay and lesbian student centers; sex with one's own gender, for anyone who is curious,'' that is you, Mr. Speaker, that is everybody in the gallery, that is these two staffers sitting here, that is our pages, that is me, ``for anyone who is curious, section with one's own gender is now a visible and protected part of campus culture.'' And protected by Newsweek, ladies and gentlemen. Queer studies. I thought queer was a politically incorrect word. ``Queer studies and gender studies are now part of the national curriculum. A popular T- shirt spotted recently in a Connecticut high school puts it this way: Do not assume I am straight.'' That is a high school kid. ``As one 17 year old bi says,'' we do not know if it is a boy or girl, 17 year old, someone over 18 rapes a 17-year-old young lady on a date, that is a statutory rape. This is a minor child that Newsweek is writing about. ``A 17-year-old minor bi says `It is not us versus them anymore. There is just more and more of us.' '' Tim Horing, but there is an umlaut--I did not know Newsweek's typewriters had umlauts over the 0--21, a sophomore--why is he a sophomore at 21? He should be a senior or junior--at City College in San Francisco, describes himself as ``typical of bisexual youth. We just refuse to label ourselves as any of the five food groups.'' That is male heterosexual, female heterosexual, male homosexual, female homosexual, and the bi's. ``We do not want to be any part of the five. We revel in the fuzziness, in the blurred images. Working class, Roman Catholic,'' and, oh, does the New York Times and the networks as CBS did in their CBS reports last night, do they love to attack Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor and the Roman Catholic Church, if they get a Catholic or practicing Baptist family or an orthodox Jewish family, oh, to get somebody from a traditional Jewish or Roman Catholic to switch over and talk about how they are a recovering Catholic or a recovering Jewish person, because of all that terrible confirmation and Holy Communion and bar mitzvah and bat mitzvah, oh, they love to get one of this. And get this, Tom's father is a retired New York narcotics cop. A narco guy taking away another one of their flesh privileges, to get high and then grope out boy for all the warm flesh. ``Horing had his first sexual fantasies about the Bionic Woman, and then in his teens he admitted to himself in a series of difficult steps that he was also attracted to men. He came out to a few friends in school, and at his graduation when his name was called, Timothy Horing, six rows in the auditorium mischievously,'' no, not mischievously, ``yelled out `The bisexual; Tim Horing, the bisexual.' A surprise to his parents.'' No, a gut-ripping heart seizure for his New York retired narcotics cop and his Roman Catholic mother. ``For the most part, he has been in monogamous relationships.'' You like that, ``for the most part?'' ``Usually with men.'' Oh, I see. I always said for my entire life that bisexuality was basically a cover story for homosexuality. That when they captured the adjective ``gay'' to say that they were happier than your average pair, more cheerful, more mirthful, that then, if they said they were bisexual, they could say ``Well, I date the whole base. I can date anybody on Capitol Hill. I am a switch-hitter. I am AC-DC, I am bi. I can go for anything. You are missing out on half the world.'' But we find out he basically dates men. As we go all the way through this, most of it is male homosexuality, not bisexuality. Though he is now dating two gay men and a bisexual woman. I see. He is spreading himself around. Two homosexual men and one half-homosexual woman. What would that give him in the rating of chess pieces? What would that make him, 87.75 homosexual? He says, young Tom, ``I never wanted a white picket fence, but I do want someone I can settle down with and raise my Benetton kids.'' Benetton. Is that the Benetton Colors out of Italy that put Ronald Reagan in major news magazines with cancer, sarcoma, AIDS sores all over his face? Is this Benetton that pushes homosexual money into every corner of America and everywhere else their clothing is marketed? I notice that the Justice Department today under Janet Reno is investigating Calvin Klein jeans to see if they used underaged children in their soft core pornography, latest wave of disgusting ads, and Klein, unless he gets taken to court, is laughing all the way to the bank again, because negative soft- or hard-core pornography sells in modern America. They just had an adult bookstore convention in the Sheraton Universal Hotel in Los Angeles, and I am reading in one of my Los Angeles Times clippings that the business, in spite of the January 17 earthquake 2 years ago, has rebounded and doubled. You do not see porno theaters in your markets anymore, because it is in all the hotels for traveling businessmen to demean somebody else's sister, wife, somebody else's daughter, who did not have the [[Page H 8719]] love of a father, and it is in all the video stores, including Blockbuster. The ripping apart of these young gals from these transitional neighborhoods who never new the loving touch, the moral touch, of a father, to hug them and kiss them and guide them through school. They are out there as the young whores of our society being used by the porno industry. And no matter how many commit suicide like Karen Applegate from a beautiful little town in Wisconsin.--I have spoken to her mother. No matter how many kill themselves. Six playmates have killed themselves over the years. When I asked Hugh Hefner that once to his face, he turned red and did not want to discuss it and said it was a lie. I knew them each by name, starting with Marilyn Monroe, his first playmate. {time} 1400 But this guy says he wants to raise his Benetton kids in a swinging orgy household. His partner may be a man or woman, he says. I don't feel forced to choose. I don't have to make any tough choices. Then it shows this very pathetic human being with his baby. He has gone through every orgy situation available to the humankind. And when people ask him what his little baby is, man or woman, he says ask the baby. He has a little boy or girl and he says, ask the baby. Smart aleck. Pray for him. He is 42 and he has three or four people on the hook. It goes on and on as it gets worse. Softening tensions. Softening tensions. This is Newsweek. That is a paragraph title. For many bisexuals, it has not been easy. When I came out in '88, says Melissa Merry, 31, energetic Chicagoan who calls herself Mel: I was told by people from local lesbian support groups not to come out as a bisexual or I would be asked to leave. They did not want the fence straddling. Well, when I got to some of these paragraphs about high schools, the first thing that flashed in my mind, as an Irish-American, was William B. Yeats poem read when Hitler started World War II. And he died that year, Yeats. It is called ``The Second Coming,'' about the beast being born, the Antichrist and slouching off to Bethlehem to be born. Those are the last lines, but it begins turning and turning in the widening gyre, as in gyrations, falcons, circle. Turning and turning in the widening gyre, the falcon no longer hears the falconer. Things fall apart. The center cannot hold. Everywhere the blood din tide is loosed. Everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned. The ceremony of innocence is drowned by Newsweek. The best lack all conviction and the worst are full of passionate intensity. There is an intensity to this article and it is evil and it is the worst. When I saw in here they are claiming James Dean, the actor who died at age 24 after only three movies, when I see they are claiming Marlene Dietrich as a bisexual lesbian, and Cary Grant, my favorite actor as a young man because of everybody's favorite movie quote-unquote ``Gunga Din,'' when I saw that, I went to the end to see how many women participated in--what is the author's name again, with John Leland in this disgusting, vile piece--and while I was back at the tail end of the article reading all the violence--by the way, if this were in Time we would not know who contributed to this. I could not call any of these people and say have you lost your moral compass totally at this magazine? Does Donald Graham read this, this cover story of this corruption, this drowning of innocence? And as I was reading, I decided I would look before I finished the story at the last line. Now, let me tell you a story about myself personally. When I was a young man in Beverly Hills, just out of high school, and I heard these rumors, because my uncle is the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz, Jack Haley, I grew up in that community. I knew who dodged the draft. I knew the heroes who went off to combat, like James Stewart and Tyrone Power. We know who all the ones that were rumored to be homosexuals. I knew about Rock Hudson 10 years before it came out in the press. I had a small bit part in a movie ``Gathering of Eagles,'' and he minced across the set and the director said cut. And Rock turned around and said was I mincing too much? And the director said, just do it again, Rock. I witnessed that, and everybody talks behind the scenes. Just as in fashion design, in ice skating, in supernumeraries, on Broadway stage, in ballet, and now in some parts of government there is a larger percentage than the 1 percent of homosexuals out there across America. And when I worked on the sets of Hollywood trying to feed my five children and dreaming about running for Congress someday, I had long philosophical discussions with a lot of young homosexual men in their 20's, and they would tell me about Rock and all the stars that they just were dying to get with some night; wanted them, and then to see them up there 50 feet high up on the silver screen and know that you had sexually been with them. What a trip. And how did I rationalize Cary Grant when I was in high school? I remember working out a rationale that when God gives you a lot of talent and you make a lot of money in your 20's or 30's--what did Robin Williams say after he came off cocaine and watched his friend John Belushi die? He said cocaine is God's way of telling you you are making too much money. It was the same way in Hollywood. Always has been. Or in any profession where money flows fast into the hands of the young. Look at all our rock stars. Look at Kurt Cobain blowing his brains out. Look at Jerry Garcia. Look at Marilyn Monroe. Look at Elvis. Look at Jimi Hendrix. Look at Jim Morrison. Look at Janis Joplin. Whether it is booze or heroin or drugs, and orgies for all of them. I watched Elvis Presley using his staff to pimp for him. I thought what a tragedy for this polite young man from Tupelo, MI. I am trying to sell him a script called the 101st American, about Vietnam, because he had served honorably in the Army, and I am watching his staff hit on young pretty extra girls for him. They rented a big mansion up in Beverly Hills below the head of the owner of the L.A. Rams, who is now dead, and you could hear the orgies going on all night long. He died naked, on drugs at 42 years of age, and now you can get a postage stamp and lick Elvis and stick him on your letter and say there went the most talented man in rock singing in our lifetime dead at 42. And in that suite of stamps you can get Marilyn Monroe. Do we forget how old she was in August of 1962 when she died? 36 years old. 36 years old! At my age, that is a kid. We are celebrating these two deaths with their most glamorous picture. Remember the debate in the Post Office department: Do we want the fat, older drug besotted Elvis or the younger Elvis in his prime? We picked the younger one. And he was a polite young man. What a tragedy! So I watched all these people corrupting themselves, and I watched others, like Jimmy Stewart and my Uncle Jack and others. I remember Danny Thomas telling me I have never told a dirty joke in my life, Bob. Do not ever forget that. My uncle told me, never stoop to dirty humor on the stage. It is too easy to get laughs. Today I watch all these comedians. It is a category with the medical word for male organ. That is all they do, are jokes on genitalia. It is sickening what is going on in Hollywood. But what was my rationale for Cary Grant? Here it was, I remember it vividly, I was in my teens. I said when you have too much money, and you can have any beautiful woman in the world, and you start going to wild Hollywood parties and drinking too much--we did not know about drugs much in those days--and you start drinking too much, and you are at an orgy, whatever moves, I guess. It is all a mortal sin. It is all promiscuity. It is all flesh. Flesh is flesh, so you experiment with everything. So I do not think Cary Grant was a homosexual or a bisexual. He just got carried away at those orgies. That was my rationale so I could like Sergeant McChesney of Gunga Din with McLaglen and with Sergeant Ballentine Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Years later, in a debate running for the Senate seat that Pete Wilson eventually won, I am debating one of the candidates back in the pack, because I am still back in the pack in the Presidential race, he was a State senator, he was raised as a German-American [[Page H 8720]] Roman Catholic, he was a colonel in the Marine Reserve, and I pointed out to him in a radio debate in 1982 at a station in Pasadena, KRLA-- how is that for a memory--I said, you know something my State Senate friend, reaching out and grabbing any kind of flesh, whether heterosexual or homosexual, lust is lust. It is one of the seven deadly sins. It is all a mortal sin whether normal or abnormal. He went ballistic. Would not accept that. Then I found out he had a scandal brewing. He had two college students where he taught as a professor, a marine officer, who were pregnant with children out of wedlock. He bragged, quite properly, at least he was pro-life. I could not understand why he took such exception to saying that God is not going to judge a promiscuous homosexual any more harshly than he will judge a promiscuous heterosexual. It is all lust. It is all the ceremony of innocence being drowned as we do this to our children. So there it is, when I am a teenager rationalizing Cary Grant and arguing on a radio show in a California Senate race in 1982. Here is my point for telling those two little tangential tales. My eyes jump above all the bylines of these people, Steve and Peter and Claudia and Mark and Nadine and Martha, and here is the last line of this disgusting, vile, decadent piece from the Graham empire of the Washington Post Newsweek magazine and other small newspapers. It says in the last paragraph, in San Francisco recently Tim Horing-- remember him, Roman Catholic, parents retired New York narco cop father--he was telling his friends about how he changed his approach to picking up boys. How old was Horing? 21. Hey, Newsweek, did you slip here in your investigative reporting? Telling his friends how he had changed his approach to pick up boys? Is he a 21-year-old chicken hawk hitting on runaway young men on the street who also, in most cases, until recently, when peer pressure overwhelms even good attentive Jewish Christian mothers and fathers. In the old days, last year, last decade, it was young boys who never knew a father's masculine touch, a mother's hug, a mom or dad taking them to a baseball game or fishing. It was young men who ran away from inattentive alcoholic families that ended up on the street of once glamorous Hollywood Boulevard to be preyed upon, P-R-E-Y-E-D upon, to be taken off for porno films and turned into midnight cowboy male street whores all along Selma Boulevard behind beautiful Jesuit Blessed Sacrament Church in Hollywood. I drove down that street when I did Michael Reagan's show a month ago, and there they are, still huddling in the driveways with less business because now most of them are infected with AIDS. So Tim Horing--I have to check if he was 21. Yes, he is 21. He says the boys that I pick up now--he has changed his approach. ``I used to say are you queer? Then I switched to, do you like boys? Now his favorite line is, do you like me?'' As he sees it, ``I have gone from the political to the historical attraction to the very personal. All that matters is if they like me.'' This is the new bisexual moment, Newsweek says. This is their close in a nutshell. And I close with this line, Mr. Speaker. ``Hard fought, hard thought, and distinctively individual. It is a thorny narrative, fraught with questions of identity and belonging. And in the end, it is really about the simple, mysterious pull between warm human bodies when the lights go out.'' My teenage rationale for Cary Grant. We are in advanced moral decay, Mr. Speaker, and I am going to stay in the Presidential race as long as I can, because there is not anyone in the race like Congressman Robert K. Dornan at age 62. ","['Mr. DORNAN.', "" Mr. Speaker, we have had a fast 3 days. Started late on Wednesday, finishing early today. Pressure is building up here for a major budgetary struggle between the two major, only major parties in the world's only superpower, on all of these budgetary issues. We have come back from a long, what we sometimes euphemistically call a district work period. We are supposed to cram in a vacation and work hard. For some of us, it is hard work. I took one of the more difficult and fast-moving factfinding trips of my career, now that I am one of only two double chairmen out of all 435 Members of this "", 'Chamber. I ', 'chair a Subcommittee on Intelligence, the Subcommittee on Technical and Tactical Intelligence, and I chair the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, which becomes the most important of all 5 military subcommittees under the Committee on National Security, what used to be called Armed Services, and is still called Armed Services in the House of Lords or the other Chamber, the Senate. On this trip, in discussing the issues with new young enlisted men, senior sergeants, petty officers, and the officer corps at all levels, up to and including four-star admirals, at Naples, at the major air base that is in command of all the bombing missions going on as we speak over poor torn ripped Bosnia-Herzegovina. And at Brendezy, down at the coast at the very heel of the Italian peninsula. That is where we have our Navy Seals, where we have what was a major listening post base. In all the world, there are only five listening to everything, San Vito Air Station, using the international airport at Brendezy where we keep our AC-130 Hercules special mission Spectre gun ships. I met with all the crews there. It is still classified whether or not they are going in at night over Bosnia. These were the aircraft that if we had them in Somalia over Mogadishu, we would have saved a dozen or more lives of our best trained Army special forces and Delta Force, Rangers and 160th Aviation Regiment, special armed squadrons. ', 'Then I ', 'traveled with Congressman Greg Laughlin, the highest ranking active reservist in the House or the Senate, of ', 'Galveston, TX,', ' and we went to ', 'Slovenia. A ', ""fascinating, brand-new country in the world. It never had nation status, let alone a seat in the United Nations since the dissolution of the Communist country of the former Yugoslavia. {time} 1315 Then we went down to Croatia, met with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's special representative to all of the problems in former Yugoslavia, Mr., that is his formal title, Mr. Sasushi Akashi, met with him at the U.N. headquarters, the blue helmet home plate in Zagreb, then went down along the Dalmatian coast, drove slowly through all of the destruction wreaked upon one of the world's most beautiful coastlines, looks for all the world like the California coastline between Santa Barbara and Monterey--just torn apart. The international airport in Zadar utterly destroyed except for the runways, all of the international terminal buildings, hollow shells of aluminum, like a nuclear explosion went off, the tower, all the windows shot out with AK-47's by the retreating Bosnian soldiers. They almost cut Croatia in half at that point, Zadar. Then we went down to Macedonia, met with all of our American tripwire forces out in the front outposts along the border, flew on white helicopters, UH-60 Blackhawks that, of course, called themselves the Whitehawks, with the United Nations stenciled on the sides, went out to these American outposts, studied this poor city of Skopje, which had been destroyed by an earthquake in 1963. It has never really made it back to a stable, functioning city, still great pockets of poverty from that horrible earthquake in 1963. Then we flew over to Albania, one of the most godforsaken but still physically beautiful countries in the world, and met with the president there, Sali Berisha, Mr. Berisha; he is a European renowned heart surgeon. His wife is a renowned doctor of pediatrics, a child doctor. What a lucky country to go from the depths of communism with a paranoidal maniac, Enver Hoxna, one of the last psychotic, paranoid Communist dictators in the world, who literally took this beautiful country of Albania, a brand new country created after World "", 'War I,', ' not a traditional nation on the face of the Earth, and just drove it into the ground, more than a half-century of locked-up paranoia and total Communist psychotic oppression, and now they have a wonderful president who said to me and to the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Laughlin], although he wants to be in the United Nations and would like to be accepted into ', 'NATO,', "" he does not care what happens in the world if he just has the friendship of the United States, just one on one, unilateral friendship, and he thinks Albania will make it into the 21st century. That is the identical message we got north of there in another one of the eight parts of Yugoslavia that have spun off in Solvenia, same message: ``U.S. friendship is what we want.'' In Albania, we looked at what was supposed to be a top-secret program [["", 'Page H ', ""8715]] and is now written about in all newspapers, the Predator, unmanned aerial vehicle [UAV] program. The pilots at that base, both Albanian and our U.S. Forces there, took us in a cave that the Chinese carved out of a mountain, a cave as long as several football fields, and there I looked at 24 or 25 MiG aircraft from the vintage of when I flew almost 40 years ago. There were MiG-19, ``Farmer'' was our "", 'NATO ', ""codeword, jets that they still fly, that were Russia's response to my F-100 Supersabre, and older jets from Korea, MiG Alley, early 1950's, MiG-15's and MiG-17's, the kind of airplane my colleague, the gentleman from California [Mr. Cunningham], shot down in North Vietnam. At least of his five victories, three are MiG-17's, all of this in this giant tunnel. And the landscape of the country is scarred, marred with 700,000 to 1 million concrete bunkers, pillboxes, machine gun posts, some of them as big as the entire rostrum of this House, others as big as from here to the other lectern, a million of them, maybe, making the whole landscape look ugly, and there is no money to remove them or drag them out to the sea and make a breakwater for a small boat harbor on this beautiful Dalmatian coast of the Adriatic. On that trip, at every stop I would take off my chairman's hat from intelligence and put on my chairman's hat from military personnel and ask our men and women at all levels of command what it will take to keep them in the military, to keep that expensive training that they were given to melt down the evil empire of the Soviet Union and stand guard over freedom and be part of the world's only superpower, and everywhere they talked about family, and quality of life; they spoke of what it would take them to earn a proper living with groceries, their compensation. So, all around that hot area of the world, I saw again that America is so lucky, as Ronald Reagan used to quote James Michener's great fictitious, but more fact than fiction, novel from the Korean war, ``The Bridges of Toko-Ri,'' ``Where do we get such men,'' and now we can say women, ``Where do we get such men and women?'' How are we so lucky as to have them serve us? The sad thing about this break, Mr. Speaker, is that we went through some of the greatest anniversaries with the House adjourned. The 50th anniversary of the end of the greatest crusade for freedom against tyranny in all of recorded history during our break, the 50th anniversary endings. We had adjourned by the time Sunday came up for the 50th anniversary of the bombing at Hiroshima; 3 days later Nagasaki, August 9. On August 15 in the Pacific, on the other side of the dateline, August 14 here, the end of shooting in the Second World War; not really so; Japanese imperial warload staff beheaded prisoners, shot them, killed all the prisoners at Unit 371 in Pingfan, outside of Mukden, Manchuria. They called these godforsaken human beings ``logs,'' to depersonalize them. They had shot them, amputated all four of their limbs, one at a time, let them recover from each amputation, training over a thousand doctors to go out to all the tentacles of the imperial octopus that was so abusing the whole eastern perimeter, western perimeter of the Pacific around Asia. They had boiled them to death to see what it was like. They had frozen them to death. They had tied them to trees and hit them with bombs and shrapnel and grenades. They had put flamethrowers on them. They had infected them with anthrax, all forms of biological warfare, and none of these people that I know of were brought to justice. That is why everybody is so grateful to the current Prime Minister of Japan, that he offered an apology that we cannot get out of their congress, their ``diet,'' but there were men killed after August 15 over there, and August 14 here. Many prisoners died. My friend, Jack Singlaub, was parachuted in with a small OSS team to the Chinese island of Hainan, under Japanese warload control. "", 'Notice I ', ""say ``warlord,'' to distinguish ourselves from the free democracy of Japan today, and it was mostly, it was all Australian and New Zealand prisoners, no Americans there. He loaded them on trains from this prison camp on the western side of Hainan island and took them over to the biggest port on the eastern side, and five or six Australian and New Zealand prisoners died on that train, but at least they died as free men. That was a very rough 2-week period. All of the prisoners were under death orders. If the United States invasion forces of Operation Olympic had set foot on the Japanese home islands, all prisoners were to be executed. Many were beheaded and beaten to death in the streets of Japanese cities if they were unfortunate enough to bail out over their target. Many of them miraculously survived. War crimes trials in Japan, but far less than those that were brought to the bar of justice, Hitler's war criminals. So we passed through all of those anniversaries without a word on this House floor, because we were out. Then came V-J "", 'Day. I ', 'decided I would spend V-J Day at our airbases encircling tortured Bosnia rather than be in Hawaii, where I planned to be and was invited to go with a World ', 'War II ', 'veteran, a young-looking gentleman from Arizona, Mr. ', 'Stump. I ', 'wanted to be on that trip, but I was so offended by the photo opportunities of the White House at the Normandy beaches to the exclusion of some of our heroes when they should have been the focus, that I did not want to subject myself to that, and I would have been pained to hear Mr. Clinton call the U.S.S. Missouri, the battleship upon which the Japanese surrender terms were unconditionally signed on September 2, 1945, I would have been pained to hear Mr. Clinton call it a carrier, an aircraft carrier. I would have been pained to hear him refer to the front of the ship, the bow, as the bow, as in a bow in your hair, and I guess he would call the stern the back side of the ship. If that had been Vice President Dan Quayle making verbal mistakes like that, you would all know about it. It would be headlines. But people are probably listening to C-', 'SPAN ', 'today, 1,300,000 who think I am making that up. No, Mr. Clinton actually said those things, aircraft carrier Missouri, bow of it, as in bow and arrow, the bow of the ship. He got away with it. I preferred to be out with the troops in the field rather than at those wonderful closing ceremonies. But now a word here on the floor, Mr. Speaker. Here is what has been painful to me over the last 4 years: Except for the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. Montgomery], two-star general, retired in the Army, of the ', 'Montgomery GI ', 'bill fame, and the aforementioned gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Stump], Navy retiree, except for one 1-hour special order that they did on Iwo Jima, there has not been a single memorial on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives or the United States Senate for any single 50-year anniversary of anything that happened all during World ', 'War II,', "" not Pearl Harbor, not the fall of Bataan, or the Bataan death march, not Corredigor, not the comeback at Guadalcanal, not the landings in Tarawa, not the Dieppe raid along the coast of Hitler's fortress Europe, not Al Alamein, not the battles at Tobruk, not the Kasserine Pass, not the landings at Sicily in July 9, 1943; we have heard here in July 1993, not Salerno, not Anzio, not Operation Overlord on D-Day, not Operation Dragon down on the southern coast of France, nothing about Okinawa, which came after Iwo Jima or the Gilbert Islands or Marshall Islands or the Battle of the Coral Sea or the Battle of Midway or the Battle of the Solomon Islands or the Santa Cruz Islands, nothing for 4 years in the Senate or the House floor pausing for a series of 1-minute speeches or 1-minute special orders. I am not saying this to pat myself on the back; except for about 10 of my 1-hour special orders, nothing, nothing on this House floor. I remember an Oklahoma Congressman shut this place down. I remember it because he lost his primary a few months later. I wondered if there was a connection. I think his name was Congressman Risenhoover. He shut this place down. We filled it with potted palms, and on Flag Day, June 14 in some late year in the late 1970's, I forget the year, we had the great western singers, June Carter and Johnny Cash, standing up there. We sang patriotic hymns, and we did Flag Day, and there was nothing special. It was not the 50th anniversary of Flag Day, or silver anniversary. It was just Flag Day, any June 14. The whole place shut down, palms, [["", 'Page H ', '8716]] potted plants all over at every entrance. I have never seen the like of it, potted plants all around the front here. We do not do that for a State of the Union with the Commander in Chief standing up there. We did not do that for Douglas MacArthur or Winston Churchill the two times he stood up there. {time} 1330 I thought, ``Wow, we are going to do this, I guess, all during World ', 'War II.', ' ', 'Am I ', ""lucky to be here.'' And, when George Bush got elected, because I went with President Bush to Pearl Harbor's 50th anniversary, and we stood there on that memorial across the midships of the U.S.S. Arizona, still a ship of the line, with the flag run up at reveille every morning. I thought, ``This is going to be great, go through all these 50-year anniversaries with a 58 combat mission Navy attack carrier pilot in the White House.'' And instead we ended up with someone who had avoided the draft three times, has insulted the military over, and over, and over with photo opportunities, using them to try to up his ratings, and thank God it fails every time, and here we are, past September 2, 1995, 50 years gone by. No memorials. "", 'Today I ', ""have an editorial, a counter-editorial, in the USA Today. They always put in the left-right views. They called my office at 2 o'clock yesterday, said, ``Give us something quick. Senator Warner is not responding fast enough, the No. 2 man on Armed Services Committee in the other body.'' They said, ``Give us something on why the military should be built up.'' We pumped out something quickly. I sent a corrected copy on a fax to USA Today at 3:30, and I said, ``Well, this will be in next week,'' and it is in this morning, a turnaround of about 15 hours before it hit the streets, and I would like to read it, Mr. Speaker. It says, ``Military Needs Buildup.'' It is what every one of these young, not-so-young, people all around the Mediterranean told me. ``"", 'Robert K.', "" Dornan, opposing view: The military budget has been hit year after year. Security demands that we spend more.'' "", 'Now I ', ""have not read the USA Today house editorial that says we must gut defense even more, but here is my response on September 8: ``After 11 straight years of defense spending cuts, Republicans are providing the national security leadership not found in the current administration. ``Indeed, President Clinton's draconian defense budget would produce another Carter-era ``hollow force'' reportedly underfunded by as much as $150 billion. Congress, therefore, is not squandering money when it votes to increase the Pentagon's budget by $7 billion more than requested. Instead, it is restoring national security funding to necessary levels. ``How soon we forget what is required to quickly and decisively win on the modern battlefield. ``Today's military modernization is tomorrow's combat readiness. Systems such as the F-117 `Nighthawk' stealth fighter and the Patriot missile were not developed overnight. They were the culmination of years of research and development. These revolutionary systems drastically reduced our casualties'' killed in acting and wounded in action) ``in Desert Storm.'' more than any other conflict in history given the level of lethality, and violence, and speed, and maneuverability. ``Today we can improve upon these systems with new weapons that will further reduce the risk to American troops. ``"", 'The B-', ""2 `Spirit' Stealth bomber,'' I helped to name that, so of course I want to get the name in, ``carries eight times the payload of the F-117, with greater range and crew survivability.'' Keep in mind, listening audience, Mr. Speaker, and my colleagues who may be packing up their bags in their offices to head back to their districts, that the B-2 survived in this Chamber by 3 votes, 213 to 210, to defeat an amendment, mostly by people who have never served in the military, to kill and shut down the world's only bomber production line, the B-2 ``Spirit.'' ``New missile defense programs, such as the upgraded Navy Aegis (A-e- g-i-s) system, provide greater range, accuracy, and coverage than Patriot missiles.'' We call that upper-tier Navy defense. Put two ships off Israel, two ships off Korea, just two ships, and the footprint from both those ships can keep Israel free from being struck with a nuclear weapon or, as we now find out from the defecting son-in-law of dictator, mad-dog killer Saddam Hussein; we now find out that, yes, they were driving to completion of a nuclear weapon and were playing around with the most deadly biological, and chemical, and nerve gas weapons since World "", 'War II ', ""and would have used them, and may have used them; the jury is out on that. So we need this Navy upper-tier Aegis system antimissile defense. ``Does the Pentagon need these expensive new programs? Ask the Air Force pilots who will not have to attack highly defended enemy targets in vulnerable, unstealthy aircraft because they will have the B-2. Ask the Marines and Army troops who will not have to worry about Scud ballistic missile attacks because of the Navy's new ballistic missile defense.'' All of this, of course, predicated upon the conference between the House and the Senate, the conference process that we are entering, that we entered this afternoon. "", 'My R&', ""D Subcommittee is meeting as I speak. I decided that letting America know what we are doing was more important than participating in that meeting because I am not the chairman of that subcommittee; the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Weldon] is. My close in today's USA Today: ``These and other Republican initiatives in areas such as personnel and training will not just maintain, but will enhance, the combat capability that has so quickly deteriorated under Clinton's leadership. ``Those of us who visit,'' as I did in the Balkans over this break our troops, ``and listen to our front-line troops are giving them what they need,'' what they deserve, ``including equipment that will drastically reduce loss of'' precious, ``life.'' ``The Reagan revolution of the 1980's laid the foundation for'' the victory in, ``Desert Storm. The Republican revolution'' that started on November 8, ``of 1994 is laying the foundation for any future victories, if that is our fate, and the survival of U.S. combat troops well into the 21st century.'' Now, Mr. "", 'Speaker, I ', 'had intended to spend the better part of this hour special order on defense on some of the votes that we won this week. We won them all on the conservative side with the help of many conservative members of the former majority party, the oldest political party in America, the Democrats, but last night I kept a promise that I made to a Navy Seal at Brandezy, ', 'Italy. I ', ""do not want to identify him by rank, but let us put it this way. All the Seal's in the Mediterranean depend on this fine young officer and Annapolis graduate from decades ago. He said to me, ``Congressman "", 'Dornan, I ', ""appreciate you being in the Presidential race, although it appears you don't have much chance of victory, as I appreciate Mr. Keyes, Alan Keyes, of Maryland, because you discuss the moral issues which I believe are the critical issues of our time.'' Now keep in mind this is a senior naval officer trained to the peak of physical and mental performance for his country. He said, ``"", 'Congressman, I ', ""believe as a naval officer that the military culture is the last stable part of American life from which we can begin the rebuilding of our Nation's moral fiber, from which we can begin to defend the moral and cultural ethos that is collapsing around us.'' "", 'Now I ', ""would like to think there is a pocket of us on both sides of the aisle in the House and the Senate that also believe that we are in an advanced state of moral decline in our country. He said to me, this naval officer, ``Did you see the cover story of Newsweek in July on bissexuality?'' I said, ``No, captain, I did not.'' He said, ``"", 'Well, I ', ""canceled my subscription with a long letter to the New York publisher and senior editors saying that this was the most vile and corrupt article I've ever seen in my life.'' "", 'And I ', ""said, ``Well, every week in my office I get 10 magazines and about 10 newspapers,'' and I said, ``I try to read as much as any human being in the [["", 'Page H ', ""8717]] House or Senate.

I ', 'can go weeks without even catching a cover story in Time, or Newsweek, or U.S. News and World Report, or all the other magazines that we get. Then there is all the great conservative publications, the moderate ones like New ', 'Republic I ', ""try to stay up with, and Crisis, and First Things, and cutting edge of Catholic and Protestant, conservative, magazines, and of course Bill Buckley, my old pal, with National Review--awful lot to read. We have tremendous responsibility here to stay informed on what our Speaker Gingrich calls the ``information highway'' to be an alert, informed man or woman in this place. It is an overwhelming job if you're trying to inform yourself of all aspects of the popular culture and try to cover the economic front, the foreign affairs front, the human rights front, the defense front, all the social issues at home, gang warfare, the O.J. Simpson trial, not as a gawking ``Lookie Lou,'' but as someone aware that this trial, as the Menendez trial has done, can put our whole jury system in jeopardy.'' "", 'And I ', 'promised this ', 'Navy SEAL ', 'that I would get the Newsweek article out of my huge piles of reading material in my office and take a look at it. I have only been home since the first of ', 'September. I ', 'got it out last night and read it. Here it is, Mr. Speaker. It is the Newsweek issue of July 17, so it hit the newsstands on Monday, July 10. I read it last night, and I agree with this naval officer, assigned at a forward base in Italy, a kind of a man who will go in and put his life on the line if another Captain ', ""Scott O'"", 'Grady gets shot down along the coast. The ', ""Navy SEAL'"", 's will have the job to go in and rescue them under fire, and I agree with this naval officer. This is the most corrupt article, let alone a cover story, that I have ever read in an American magazine in my life--Newsweek. The Washington bureau chief, and we are having our problems right now over another issue that personally involves my honor, and I will do a 1-hour special order or a personal privilege in the middle of the day-- no, I would not do that in September, budget month--to defend my honor from an attack by a reporter who has only been--who was not even hired when this issue came out, who attacked my honor and said I crashed four aircraft in the Air ', 'Force. I ', ""have not crashed one. Ejected twice from totally out-of-control aircraft, but he doubled that to four and said I crashed them and said I was a black ace, one kind of black ace. The only black aces I know were an F-14 squadron called the ``Black Aces'' in the unheralded until the HBO special in the last few weeks, the 99th fighter squadron, and then the 332nd Fighter Group, the Tuskegee airmen, our young fighter pilots in the Italian theatre of African- American heritage who are finally getting their recognition 52 years after they entered combat. That is the only ``Black Aces'' I know about. "", 'But I ', 'am having my problems with Evan Thomas, who I think is one of the better talking heads. He will be on television tomorrow, on a program called ``', 'Inside U.', ""S.A.,'' a handsome young man, and we are having out problems on this, but I have not talked to him about this issue, and I will. I am going to fly up to New "", 'York. I ', ""am going to go see Donald and Katharine Graham. She is chairman emeritus and has discussed this issue. I almost wonder if I can read this in the Chamber, but listen to this. I wish you folks were not leaving up there because--well, get the Congressional Record tomorrow and read this. Here is the article on bisexuality. It is under ``Lifestyle,'' of course. ``Bisexuality is the wild card of our erotic life. Now it is coming out in the open, in pop culture, in cyberspace, and on campus. But can you really have it both ways?'' They asked rhetorically, question mark, by John Leland. The answer is Newsweek thinks you can because in this article, one of America's great magazines--when I was a little kid coming out of St. Patrick's, I used to look at their beautiful headquarters building right there on Fifth Avenue across from Tiffany somewhere. Newsweek, which is owned by the Washington Post, one of America's three major newspapers, all of them liberal: L.A. Times, New York Times, Washington Post. They own this, so it is under Katharine and Donald Graham. Here is what Newsweek says about this issue. Brace yourself for culture shock if you are still shockable. They show here Theresa, and Ronelle, all these couples, Stephen and Linda. Of course, she's 47 and he's 30. They all have multiple partners, they all switch-hit, they are all "", 'AC/DC,', "" they are dual- gaited. I remember all the cute words in New York, and, after all, I grew up in Manhattan and then west to Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, so I know all the flippant dialog. {time} 1345 Here is a woman, 48, with a young Hispanic guy, it looks like he is about 17, 18, 19; he is in his early 20's. Freud said we are all bisexual. He thought that exclusive heterosexuality was a problem. In the copy it says that he thought homosexuality was a problem, and he never got around to that, because he died and met God before he had a chance to get into that. But the article goes on, and by its commentary, approving of this fifth gender. Bella Abzug stands up in Beijing, China, in the middle of the world's most oppressive human rights, communistic dictatorship and mentions homophobia and gets a standing ovation from all of the assembled feminists of the world. if Ms. Hillary was in the room, she would have given her a standing ovation. So here in the picture of this blue-eyed, red-headed guy, Tim, 24, with Ellen, 30 years of age. She has done it all, it is always older women and younger guys in these bisexual things. Listen to this. ``The bisexual blip of the 1970's was an offshoot of the sexual revolution.'' Of course, Newsweek's position is the sexual revolution was just grand. Tell that to 200,000 people dead of "", 'AIDS,', "" another million infected in this country, and 10 to 20 million affected all around the world. Make love, casual sex like alley cats, not war. So they refer to the sexual revolution in an approving way. ``The bisexual blip was an offshoot of that revolution. It was straight with a twist. By contrast, the current bisexual movement rises from the gay and feminists movements.'' Notice it did not say lesbian wing of the feminist movement, just the feminist movement. ``For a generation that came of age during the gay rights movement, same-sex relationships or experiments no longer carry the stigma they once did.'' Stigma. What would that mean? Would that mean sin? Right and wrong, evil, banal sin, mortal sin? Newsweek magazine, with this article, Mr. Speaker, and anybody listening, make no mistake about it, Newsweek magazine, with this July 17 cover story, is a direct frontal attack on everything that I was ever taught by my parents, by every teacher I had in grade school, high school, and college. It is a direct frontal assault on Mother Theresa, on Pope John "", 'Paul II,', ' on Billy Graham, or every Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish theologian in this Nation. It is a frontal assault on Moses, right before my eyes, on the Jewish rabbi and great lawgiver Mimones over here; it is a frontal assault on the justice code of almost all of the 23 men whose medallions you see up in this Chamber: The Pope, Pope Innocent, Pope Gregory, St. Louis, Pope Alphonse. It is an assault upon every moral code in this country, but it says, there is no more stigma to promiscuity and groping around like alley cats, and any drug- infested party you can go to, and it gets worse. No longer a stigma. Get this next line. I hope you are watching, Evan Thomas. If my office is listening, Mr. ', 'Speaker, I ', ""hope they call Newsweek because he is in his office this afternoon, and ask Evan Thomas to please turn on the television and listen to this. This is not in quotes, this is Newsweek writing, this is John Leland writing, with the help, and I am going to mention him right now, of Steve Rhodes, contributing in Chicago, Peter Katel in Miami, Claudia Kalb and Marc Peyser in New York, Nadine Joseph in San Francisco, and Martha Brant in Washington, in the Washington office and bureau reports. Get this next line, after there is no stigma: ``More and more of us-- at work * * *'' Is this Newsweek people at work?--at school, in our families, and [["", 'Page H ', ""8718]] in our entertainments--``move comfortably between gay and straight worlds.'' ``Most of us in our work move comfortably between gay and straight worlds and in our schools?'' Then they go to a quote: ``Those of us who are younger,'' says Rebecca Kaplan, 24, a psychology major at Massachusetts Institute of Technology--what are your SAT scores to get into MIT? She says, ``those of us who are younger owe a great deal to gays, lesbians and bisexuals who came before us.'' Who came before us? That is a line for George Washington in his inaugural speech, April 30, 1789. We owe this to Benjamin Franklin and to George Mason up here, we owe it to them, Thomas Payne and those who came before us, those who died at Lexington and Concord, those who suffered during the six and a half years of the Revolutionary War. Any African-American can say, we owe this to those who died in the conflict, to the terrorist John Brown and his sons, we owe it to everybody who came before us, our freedom. What was the greatest scene in the wonderful movie, ``Glory,'' when Morgan Freeman says to the young rebel Denzel Washington, he says, white boys have anted up and died for our freedom; now it is our time to ante up, and he rallies the 4th regiment to go against Fort Wagner, and they gave their lives in the fight for freedom to keep this country. As it says here, tolerance, liberty and union on the other side, those who went before us. ``The bisexuals, lesbians who went before us, we owe it to them.'' She is going to make a great psychologist. Still in school at age 24. She says, ``because of them,'' Rebecca continues, ``I was able to come out as a bisexual and not hate myself.'' Here is this word feminism again, not the lesbian branch of feminism. Feminism has also made romantic attachments between two women--either provisional or lasting-- more acceptable, even privileged. Do you know that I had to be a Congressman approaching my sixties before a young graduate of Holyoke told me that the majority of women at that college would say they were lesbians? That she had to form on campus a heterosexual club to defend themselves. They were not just defending virginity, they were defending normal heterosexuality. And she said, of course, most of the women are 4-year lesbians, or more accurately a 3-year, 9-month lesbian. Peer pressure, sexual lesbian experimentation, and then as, some radical lesbians have said, dripping bile from their lips, they have said, and then the sisters betray us, not in this order necessarily, and go out and get themselves a dog, a station wagon, children and a husband. Is that what Newsweek means by provisional lesbians? Just while they were in college, at a school of higher learning, one of the privileged of the world, to get advanced education beyond high school? Then it says, after privileged, ``as president of the National Organization for Women, Patricia Ireland sets a quiet example.'' She is a big mouth, so what does quiet mean? ``She has both a husband and a female companion.'' What kind of a wimp is her husband down there in Miami that he lets her keep a lesbian roommate up there in "", 'Washington, DC.', "" where she does the work of NOW, preparing to send Bella Abzug to rant on in Beijing, China about homophobia? Incredible. And there were some people at NOW that voted against the Nation's most famous lesbian becoming head of NOW. Now, this in Newsweek, and this is in quotes, ``Namely every college or university in the country and some high schools now have gay and lesbian student centers; sex with one's own gender, for anyone who is curious,'' that is you, Mr. Speaker, that is everybody in the gallery, that is these two staffers sitting here, that is our pages, that is me, ``for anyone who is curious, section with one's own gender is now a visible and protected part of campus culture.'' And protected by Newsweek, ladies and gentlemen. Queer studies. I thought queer was a politically incorrect word. ``Queer studies and gender studies are now part of the national curriculum. A popular T- shirt spotted recently in a Connecticut high school puts it this way: Do not assume I am straight.'' That is a high school kid. ``As one 17 year old bi says,'' we do not know if it is a boy or girl, 17 year old, someone over 18 rapes a 17-year-old young lady on a date, that is a statutory rape. This is a minor child that Newsweek is writing about. ``A 17-year-old minor bi says `It is not us versus them anymore. There is just more and more of us.' '' Tim Horing, but there is an umlaut--I did not know Newsweek's typewriters had umlauts over the 0--21, a sophomore--why is he a sophomore at 21? He should be a senior or junior--at City College in San Francisco, describes himself as ``typical of bisexual youth. We just refuse to label ourselves as any of the five food groups.'' That is male heterosexual, female heterosexual, male homosexual, female homosexual, and the bi's. ``We do not want to be any part of the five. We revel in the fuzziness, in the blurred images. Working class, Roman Catholic,'' and, oh, does the New York Times and the networks as CBS did in their CBS reports last night, do they love to attack Cardinal John "", ""Joseph O'"", ""Connor and the Roman Catholic Church, if they get a Catholic or practicing Baptist family or an orthodox Jewish family, oh, to get somebody from a traditional Jewish or Roman Catholic to switch over and talk about how they are a recovering Catholic or a recovering Jewish person, because of all that terrible confirmation and Holy Communion and bar mitzvah and bat mitzvah, oh, they love to get one of this. And get this, Tom's father is a retired New York narcotics cop. A narco guy taking away another one of their flesh privileges, to get high and then grope out boy for all the warm flesh. ``Horing had his first sexual fantasies about the Bionic Woman, and then in his teens he admitted to himself in a series of difficult steps that he was also attracted to men. He came out to a few friends in school, and at his graduation when his name was called, Timothy Horing, six rows in the auditorium mischievously,'' no, not mischievously, ``yelled out `The bisexual; Tim Horing, the bisexual.' A surprise to his parents.'' No, a gut-ripping heart seizure for his New York retired narcotics cop and his Roman Catholic mother. ``For the most part, he has been in monogamous relationships.'' You like that, ``for the most part?'' ``Usually with men.'' "", 'Oh, I ', ""see. I always said for my entire life that bisexuality was basically a cover story for homosexuality. That when they captured the adjective ``gay'' to say that they were happier than your average pair, more cheerful, more mirthful, that then, if they said they were bisexual, they could say ``"", 'Well, I ', 'date the whole base. I can date anybody on Capitol ', 'Hill. I ', 'am a switch-hitter. I am ', 'AC-DC,', "" I am bi. I can go for anything. You are missing out on half the world.'' But we find out he basically dates men. As we go all the way through this, most of it is male homosexuality, not bisexuality. Though he is now dating two gay men and a bisexual woman. I see. He is spreading himself around. Two homosexual men and one half-homosexual woman. What would that give him in the rating of chess pieces? What would that make him, 87.75 homosexual? He says, young Tom, ``I never wanted a white picket fence, but I do want someone I can settle down with and raise my Benetton kids.'' Benetton. Is that the Benetton Colors out of Italy that put Ronald Reagan in major news magazines with cancer, sarcoma, "", 'AIDS ', ""sores all over his face? Is this Benetton that pushes homosexual money into every corner of America and everywhere else their clothing is marketed? I notice that the Justice Department today under Janet Reno is investigating Calvin Klein jeans to see if they used underaged children in their soft core pornography, latest wave of disgusting ads, and Klein, unless he gets taken to court, is laughing all the way to the bank again, because negative soft- or hard-core pornography sells in modern America. They just had an adult bookstore convention in the Sheraton Universal Hotel in Los Angeles, and I am reading in one of my Los Angeles Times clippings that the business, in spite of the January 17 earthquake 2 years ago, has rebounded and doubled. You do not see porno theaters in your markets anymore, because it is in all the hotels for traveling businessmen to demean somebody else's sister, wife, somebody else's daughter, who did not have the [["", 'Page H ', '8719]] love of a father, and it is in all the video stores, including Blockbuster. The ripping apart of these young gals from these transitional neighborhoods who never new the loving touch, the moral touch, of a father, to hug them and kiss them and guide them through school. They are out there as the young whores of our society being used by the porno industry. And no matter how many commit suicide like Karen Applegate from a beautiful little town in Wisconsin.--I have spoken to her mother. No matter how many kill themselves. Six playmates have killed themselves over the years. ', 'When I ', ""asked Hugh Hefner that once to his face, he turned red and did not want to discuss it and said it was a lie. I knew them each by name, starting with Marilyn Monroe, his first playmate. {time} 1400 But this guy says he wants to raise his Benetton kids in a swinging orgy household. His partner may be a man or woman, he says. I don't feel forced to choose. I don't have to make any tough choices. Then it shows this very pathetic human being with his baby. He has gone through every orgy situation available to the humankind. And when people ask him what his little baby is, man or woman, he says ask the baby. He has a little boy or girl and he says, ask the baby. Smart aleck. Pray for him. He is 42 and he has three or four people on the hook. It goes on and on as it gets worse. Softening tensions. Softening tensions. This is Newsweek. That is a paragraph title. For many bisexuals, it has not been easy. "", 'When I ', ""came out in '88, says Melissa Merry, 31, energetic Chicagoan who calls herself "", 'Mel: I ', 'was told by people from local lesbian support groups not to come out as a bisexual or I would be asked to leave. They did not want the fence straddling. Well, when I got to some of these paragraphs about high schools, the first thing that flashed in my mind, as an Irish-American, was ', 'William B.', ' Yeats poem read when Hitler started World ', 'War II.', "" And he died that year, Yeats. It is called ``The Second Coming,'' about the beast being born, the Antichrist and slouching off to Bethlehem to be born. Those are the last lines, but it begins turning and turning in the widening gyre, as in gyrations, falcons, circle. Turning and turning in the widening gyre, the falcon no longer hears the falconer. Things fall apart. The center cannot hold. Everywhere the blood din tide is loosed. Everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned. The ceremony of innocence is drowned by Newsweek. The best lack all conviction and the worst are full of passionate intensity. There is an intensity to this article and it is evil and it is the worst. "", 'When I ', ""saw in here they are claiming James Dean, the actor who died at age 24 after only three movies, when I see they are claiming Marlene Dietrich as a bisexual lesbian, and Cary Grant, my favorite actor as a young man because of everybody's favorite movie quote-unquote ``Gunga Din,'' when I saw that, I went to the end to see how many women participated in--what is the author's name again, with John Leland in this disgusting, vile piece--and while I was back at the tail end of the article reading all the violence--by the way, if this were in Time we would not know who contributed to this. I could not call any of these people and say have you lost your moral compass totally at this magazine? Does Donald Graham read this, this cover story of this corruption, this drowning of innocence? And as I was reading, I decided I would look before I finished the story at the last line. Now, let me tell you a story about myself personally. "", 'When I ', 'was a young man in Beverly Hills, just out of high school, and I heard these rumors, because my uncle is the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz, Jack ', 'Haley, I ', ""grew up in that community. I knew who dodged the draft. I knew the heroes who went off to combat, like James Stewart and Tyrone Power. We know who all the ones that were rumored to be homosexuals. I knew about Rock Hudson 10 years before it came out in the press. I had a small bit part in a movie ``Gathering of Eagles,'' and he minced across the set and the director said cut. And Rock turned around and said was I mincing too much? And the director said, just do it again, "", 'Rock. I ', ""witnessed that, and everybody talks behind the scenes. Just as in fashion design, in ice skating, in supernumeraries, on Broadway stage, in ballet, and now in some parts of government there is a larger percentage than the 1 percent of homosexuals out there across America. And when I worked on the sets of Hollywood trying to feed my five children and dreaming about running for Congress someday, I had long philosophical discussions with a lot of young homosexual men in their 20's, and they would tell me about Rock and all the stars that they just were dying to get with some night; wanted them, and then to see them up there 50 feet high up on the silver screen and know that you had sexually been with them. What a trip. And how did I rationalize Cary Grant when I was in high school? I remember working out a rationale that when God gives you a lot of talent and you make a lot of money in your 20's or 30's--what did Robin Williams say after he came off cocaine and watched his friend John Belushi die? He said cocaine is God's way of telling you you are making too much money. It was the same way in Hollywood. Always has been. Or in any profession where money flows fast into the hands of the young. Look at all our rock stars. Look at Kurt Cobain blowing his brains out. Look at Jerry Garcia. Look at Marilyn Monroe. Look at Elvis. Look at Jimi Hendrix. Look at Jim Morrison. Look at Janis Joplin. Whether it is booze or heroin or drugs, and orgies for all of them. I watched Elvis Presley using his staff to pimp for him. I thought what a tragedy for this polite young man from "", 'Tupelo, MI.', ' I am trying to sell him a script called the 101st American, about Vietnam, because he had served honorably in the Army, and I am watching his staff hit on young pretty extra girls for him. They rented a big mansion up in Beverly Hills below the head of the owner of the L.A. Rams, who is now dead, and you could hear the orgies going on all night long. He died naked, on drugs at 42 years of age, and now you can get a postage stamp and lick Elvis and stick him on your letter and say there went the most talented man in rock singing in our lifetime dead at 42. And in that suite of stamps you can get Marilyn Monroe. Do we forget how old she was in August of 1962 when she died? 36 years old. 36 years old! At my age, that is a kid. We are celebrating these two deaths with their most glamorous picture. Remember the debate in the Post Office department: Do we want the fat, older drug besotted Elvis or the younger Elvis in his prime? We picked the younger one. And he was a polite young man. What a tragedy! ', 'So I ', 'watched all these people corrupting themselves, and I watched others, like Jimmy Stewart and my Uncle Jack and others. I remember Danny Thomas telling me I have never told a dirty joke in my life, Bob. Do not ever forget that. My uncle told me, never stoop to dirty humor on the stage. It is too easy to get laughs. ', 'Today I ', 'watch all these comedians. It is a category with the medical word for male organ. That is all they do, are jokes on genitalia. It is sickening what is going on in Hollywood. But what was my rationale for Cary Grant? Here it was, I remember it vividly, I was in my teens. I said when you have too much money, and you can have any beautiful woman in the world, and you start going to wild Hollywood parties and drinking too much--we did not know about drugs much in those days--and you start drinking too much, and you are at an orgy, whatever moves, I guess. It is all a mortal sin. It is all promiscuity. It is all flesh. Flesh is flesh, so you experiment with everything. ', 'So I ', 'do not think Cary Grant was a homosexual or a bisexual. He just got carried away at those orgies. That was my rationale so I could like Sergeant McChesney of Gunga Din with McLaglen and with Sergeant Ballentine Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Years later, in a debate running for the Senate seat that Pete Wilson eventually won, I am debating one of the candidates back in the pack, because I am still back in the pack in the Presidential race, he was a State senator, he was raised as a German-American [[', 'Page H ', '8720]] Roman Catholic, he was a colonel in the Marine Reserve, and I pointed out to him in a radio debate in 1982 at a station in ', 'Pasadena, KRLA-', '- how is that for a memory--I said, you know something my State Senate friend, reaching out and grabbing any kind of flesh, whether heterosexual or homosexual, lust is lust. It is one of the seven deadly sins. It is all a mortal sin whether normal or abnormal. He went ballistic. Would not accept that. ', 'Then I ', ""found out he had a scandal brewing. He had two college students where he taught as a professor, a marine officer, who were pregnant with children out of wedlock. He bragged, quite properly, at least he was pro-life. I could not understand why he took such exception to saying that God is not going to judge a promiscuous homosexual any more harshly than he will judge a promiscuous heterosexual. It is all lust. It is all the ceremony of innocence being drowned as we do this to our children. So there it is, when I am a teenager rationalizing Cary Grant and arguing on a radio show in a California Senate race in 1982. Here is my point for telling those two little tangential tales. My eyes jump above all the bylines of these people, Steve and Peter and Claudia and Mark and Nadine and Martha, and here is the last line of this disgusting, vile, decadent piece from the Graham empire of the Washington Post Newsweek magazine and other small newspapers. It says in the last paragraph, in San Francisco recently Tim Horing-- remember him, Roman Catholic, parents retired New York narco cop father--he was telling his friends about how he changed his approach to picking up boys. How old was Horing? 21. Hey, Newsweek, did you slip here in your investigative reporting? Telling his friends how he had changed his approach to pick up boys? Is he a 21-year-old chicken hawk hitting on runaway young men on the street who also, in most cases, until recently, when peer pressure overwhelms even good attentive Jewish Christian mothers and fathers. In the old days, last year, last decade, it was young boys who never knew a father's masculine touch, a mother's hug, a mom or dad taking them to a baseball game or fishing. It was young men who ran away from inattentive alcoholic families that ended up on the street of once glamorous Hollywood Boulevard to be preyed upon, P-R-E-Y-E-D upon, to be taken off for porno films and turned into midnight cowboy male street whores all along Selma Boulevard behind beautiful Jesuit Blessed Sacrament Church in "", 'Hollywood. I ', ""drove down that street when I did Michael Reagan's show a month ago, and there they are, still huddling in the driveways with less business because now most of them are infected with "", 'AIDS.', ' So Tim Horing--I have to check if he was 21. Yes, he is 21. He says the boys that I pick up now--he has changed his approach. ``I used to say are you queer? ', 'Then I ', ""switched to, do you like boys? Now his favorite line is, do you like me?'' As he sees it, ``I have gone from the political to the historical attraction to the very personal. All that matters is if they like me.'' This is the new bisexual moment, Newsweek says. This is their close in a nutshell. "", 'And I ', ""close with this line, Mr. Speaker. ``Hard fought, hard thought, and distinctively individual. It is a thorny narrative, fraught with questions of identity and belonging. And in the end, it is really about the simple, mysterious pull between warm human bodies when the lights go out.'' My teenage rationale for Cary Grant. We are in advanced moral decay, Mr. Speaker, and I am going to stay in the Presidential race as long as I can, because there is not anyone in the race like Congressman "", 'Robert K.', ' Dornan at age 62. ']"
68,"BOSNIA Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, earlier today Bosnia was discussed on the floor here. I wish to make a few remarks in that regard in the time allotted in morning business, because I think there is a great deal that is misunderstood about the peace process and our involvement in it and what our relationship is to the talks going on in Dayton. When we talk about the House, they had a lot of discussion in the House, and, of course, they had their vote over there, against any involvement in this or against going in militarily. But what has to be agreed to before we even get involved in any way, what has to be agreed to, is a complete peace agreement. It has to be agreed to, and not only agreed to but the firing has to have stopped before we move in. There are those who, apparently, assume we are going to have to fight our way in to establish peace and establish a peace as Tito did during the only period in modern history where there has been peace in Yugoslavia. That was a militarily imposed peace on the whole country. That is not the kind of peace we are talking about. There have to be two conditions met. First, there has to be an agreement. It has to be airtight. It has to be extremely detailed. It has to define exactly what the borders are. It has to define exactly which town is in what sector and what they have agreed to and signed up and said will be the new formation of those cities, those newly emerging countries in that area. So that agreement they are trying to work out in Dayton right now has to be in that fine a detail. It cannot be just a peace agreement that says we will move in and we hope we can establish peace. ``Yes, United States and NATO, you come and we know this will all work out.'' It is not that kind of agreement they are working toward. If I thought it was that kind of agreement, I would not be supporting this process whatsoever. What they are talking about is a very, very detailed agreement-- specific borders. Will this orchard be on this side? Whose territory will it be in? Will the next farm be in somebody else's territory? Will the road junction be in whose territory? That is the kind of detail they are trying to work out on huge maps out there in Dayton. I would say, it will be uphill at best that there will be any agreement coming out of that. I am still of the opinion that it is probably 60-40 against our ever being involved over there, because I doubt the parties will be able to come to that kind of definitive outline on a map as to who has what in their territory. It has to be that way or we should not get involved. Second, the firing has to have stopped. The firing has to have ceased. Obviously, the next question is, then, if they have that kind of commitment to peace, which they say they have, and that is the reason they are in Dayton talking, and they have come to a definitive peace agreement and firing has stopped, why does anybody need to go in? We were over there recently, just 1 month ago this weekend. Four weeks ago this weekend I was part of the Senator Stevens' Codel over there. We were briefed by our military leadership and by our people and U.N. people in Zagreb and Croatia. We flew into Sarajevo for a period of time, along with 21,000 pounds of peas on a C-130, and out again. We spent about half a day, which does not make us experts in that area, but it was interesting to see it, anyway. Then we came back through Brussels and talked to our Ambassadors there. But, when we were there, what we were so impressed with was there is a desire for peace. That is what has started this whole thing. The parties themselves say they are tired of war. The parties themselves say they want peace but are unable to get it. If we have the agreement and we have the cease-fire, why do we need to go? Here are the facts we were told while we were over there. It is estimated that about 20 to 50 percent of the people involved in the fighting there are what they call the irregulars. They are not people who are part of a regular, organized military militia that accepts commands from above or from Belgrade or anyplace else. They are people who are the irregulars. They are the farmers who are out cutting hay one day. They go up to the lines, up to the next village where there is a battle going on, they take a rifle from someone, they are in the lines for 3 or 4 days while someone else goes back to cut their hay. They are the people who, in the 30-some cease-fires that there have been over there so far, they are the ones who have violated the cease-fire because they basically do not take orders from anyone in particular. So the firing starts again, it spreads, and we have had 30- some cease-fires that have not worked. The fighting starts again. What is contemplated, and what our role would be over there--if we go in, if there is the airtight agreement, if the firing has stopped--then there would be zones set up between the parties along these borders, well-defined borders, where there would be 2- to 4-kilometer width areas in this that would be patrolled or would be monitored by the NATO forces, of which we would be about one-third of the total NATO force. I do not see that as being bad in that situation. Now, if there is firing by these irregulars or anyone else, we would put it down immediately. We would hope, because of the massive show of force we are putting in there, there would be no firing. If there is, it would be put down and put down immediately. It would be by NATO rules of engagement, not the U.N. rules of engagement. They are more of a debating society than anything else. But NATO rules of engagement say if you are fired on, you can obliterate that source. I asked General [[Page S 17448]] Joulwan, would we be permitted to take out anybody who fired on any of the NATO forces? Absolutely. That is key to the whole thing. Will there be any risk? I suppose there is. We have already had three people killed over there when we had Frasure, Kruzel, and Drew, who were in a vehicle that slid off the road and they were killed in the wreck. That is tragic. Our hearts go out to their families on this. I knew one of the gentlemen, Mr. Kruzel, in particular. It is a terrible thing that anybody is killed in a situation like this. But will there be any danger of accidents like that, or maybe somebody getting killed? There might be. But I would also point out we do not withdraw the Peace Corps from overseas, and the Peace Corps in its history has had 224 people who have died overseas. I was surprised it was that high a number. I would have thought it would have been a very, very few, but the Peace Corps lost 224 people so far, to this date, since its inception. Like the old saying in aviation, ``How do you have complete, 100 percent aviation safety? You keep all the airplanes in the hangar. You do not risk them.'' Yet we know how much good we have done around the world by being involved to some extent. We have a Christian-Judeo heritage of helping people, alleviating suffering around the world. We supply food, we send out AID programs. Of course, we cannot solve all the world's problems, either with peaceful organizations or with the military. But I think an American leadership in the world has been such a force for good, I would hate to see us go back to trying to be an isolationist America. I repeat once again, we have to have an agreement, airtight. The firing has to have stopped. Then we go in with minimal risk, with our NATO allies, to try to keep that peace that has been eluding them so far, basically because of the irregulars who do not honor these cease- fires. Our leadership is important. We restored democracy in Haiti. In the process of doing that, of leading, we have been involved in bringing peace to the Middle East, working on it in Northern Ireland, we see Russian nuclear weapons are no longer aimed at our people. We secured the indefinite extension of a Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which was a big step forward. We achieved real progress toward a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. We reached an agreement with North Korea to end its nuclear weapons program. These are products of American leadership, and that is just a little, partial list. We have seen democracies growing in South America because of our involvement there. I think the risk over there, in that Bosnian area, if it is done pursuant to a well-thought-out agreement and a cease-fire, and we go in with a preponderance of force that people understand is going to be used if they break the peace and if they fire--to me is well worth the risk. Much has been made out of the fact that we want to provide leadership for NATO. I agree with that. I think our membership in NATO is very important. But that is not just the reason why we go in. That is pointed to, sometimes, as the reason we go in, in effect saying, ``There go our NATO people. We better rush out and lead them, because we are the biggest factor in NATO.'' I will not agree with that. NATO has to be right. Let us judge this on whether it is right to go in, or wrong to go in, and try to get peace in that area where peace has not taken root for so long, and where some of the actions that have happened there in the past have literally been the sparks that set off two world wars. So, if we can bring peace to that area, to me it is well worth the risk. NATO leadership, I think, is, important, and NATO has been looked at by too many Americans, I believe, as just some sort of a remnant of the cold war, and let us forget it and move out of NATO. Is it still important? I do believe NATO is important. It is important. NATO leadership is what is moving us into the organization for security and cooperation in Europe working with the European Union. We have a Partnership for Peace, which is in its fledgling days but becoming more and more important. The North Atlantic Cooperation Council was formed in 1991. That is moving ahead, and really is a good force for peace in that part of the world. We are the biggest factor in NATO. I think it is important that we retain that. But I do not see our leadership of NATO as just being the only reason we should move into that particular area. I know my time is up. Do not forget for 1 minute that we have to have an airtight agreement. We have to have a cease-fire, and on that basis we move in to try to give peace a chance in that very, very tough area of the world. I yield the floor. Several Senators addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are in morning business under a 10-minute rule. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President I wanted to respond to the Senator from Rhode Island and some others today. I found his remarks to be particularly interesting and helpful, and, as is often the case, I find myself agreeing with a fair amount of what he says. He is sensible, and moderate, which is probably difficult for many these days. I saw a cartoon recently in which someone was pointing at someone else and saying ``There is no room for moderates here.'' The fact is that there is a lot of room for moderates. There are moderates in both political parties who generally do not view things from the extremes and who want to solve problems. I hope we will find a way, using some common sense, to engage in an attempt to find solutions to some of the vexing problems we have in this country. The Senator from Georgia was on the floor talking about trash television a few moments ago. My sense is that people in this country are concerned about two principal areas, and he hit on one of those. One is economic security. The fact is that many Americans are having more trouble finding a job, and many others are finding that their wages are declining. Sixty percent of American families are working harder for less money and are losing income. This means less economic security. I think people are very concerned about that. They are also concerned about the diminution of values--the lowering of standards in this country. And part of that relates to trash television and violence on television. We can do something about some of these things, but not all of them. We must address some of the issues in the home and in the community. But some of these problems represent public policy areas as well. In the area of economic security, one of the things that is often discussed--and one that I agree with--is that we have to put our fiscal house in order at some point. We cannot continue to run enormous debts year after year. We cannot spend money we do not have forever. I would not have a problem if next year we spent $400 billion we did not have--and therefore incur a deficit next year of $400 billion--if with that $400 billion we cured cancer just like that. I would say that was a pretty good investment. You amortize that over the next 40, 50, 70 years, and it would be worth paying off the $400 billion deficit incurred to cure cancer. But that is not what these deficits are about. These are systemic deficits in the operating budgets of this country. You cannot continue that. You must address it. That is why I said last evening that I commend the majority party for a reconciliation bill that contains some things that are good. It contains some awful things as well, and I think some bad priorities. I am glad the President is going to veto it. I do not support it. But it has a good number of things that make a lot of sense. There are a good number of things in that reconciliation bill that both sides would agree to. But there are some major elements of the reconciliation bill that must be changed because, as we address the deficit in this country--and ultimately we must do it together--we must find a compromise. We should not ask the portion of the American people who have the least to bear the biggest burden of all the spending cuts, and then turn to the small portion of those who [[Page S 17449]] have the most and give them the largest share of the tax cuts. We have to try to fix some of those things. With respect to where we are today, the shutdown ought to end. The reconciliation bill is passed. The President is going to veto it. Negotiations, in my judgment, ought to begin immediately to try to find a solution to the impasse and a solution to the reconciliation bill. The question ought not be whether we have a reconciliation bill. The question is not whether we address the budget deficit and lead to a balanced budget. The question is, how do we do that? Not whether, but how? There is no good reason, in my judgment, to have a continued government shutdown. There is no juice left in that lemon for anybody-- not for any political party, and not for any political leader. This shutdown does not make any sense. I probably contribute to some of the concerns about the language that has been used during the shutdown. I read on the floor statements by the Speaker of the House, who in April said, ``We are going to create a titanic standoff and shut down the Government.'' Those are the facts. However, I am not saying that only one party is at fault here. The fact is that there is lots of room for blame. There has been lots of language uttered in these past few days that has caused a lot of chaos in the political system. But we find ourselves in a circumstance where we have people who say it is either our way or it is no way. If you do not do it our way, we will shut the Government down. The fact is Government works by consent. This is a democracy. For 200 years we have had impasses over wars, over depressions, over dozens and dozens of vexing, troublesome issues. The way those impasses have been solved is that people with good will, with common sense, have come together and said, ``Let us reason. Let us find a way to meet the goal, to work out this problem together.'' I want to mention a couple of things that were in the reconciliation bill which causes a lot of problems. Medicare--do we need to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare and Medicaid? Yes, we do. Not just in Medicare and Medicaid but in the price of health care generally for families, for businesses, for governments. The price of health care, the escalation of health care costs year after year somehow has to be addressed. But no one can any longer believe that what is in this reconciliation bill will address the price escalation in Medicare by saying to senior citizens you will have the same quality health care and you will not pay more for it. Everyone understands this approach means senior citizens will get less and pay more. The tax cut--many of us feel very strongly that the facts show every dollar of this tax cut will be borrowed. I would love to have somebody come and explain why that is not true. Regrettably, it is true. Every dollar of the proposed $245 billion tax cut will be borrowed and will add to the national debt, which adds to the burden of those children we have been talking about. On the car radio on the way in this morning, I heard a woman who had called the radio to talk about the shutdown. She said both of her parents, regrettably, have to go to a nursing home, one because of Alzheimer's and one who had a stroke. They have been there 5 years and started out with an asset base of $400,000 to $600,000. Now much of that is gone. She called and said, ``My worry is for when their assets are gone--and I believe that their assets should be used to pay for their care--my parents will not have an entitlement to Medicaid.'' When their assets are gone, under this new proposal, they will not have guaranteed coverage under Medicaid. That will be up to the States. Maybe the States will decide that nursing home care is an entitlement for her parents. Maybe not. She was worried about that. That is a significant change. That was in this budget reconciliation bill. I mentioned last evening the differences in spending priorities that have been talked about and for which the CR was fought over this weekend--cuts of 40 percent out of a little program called Star Schools; only $25 million is spent on Star Schools and that will be cut by 40 percent. The bill the Senate passed the other day, which I voted against, doubles the amount of money spent on star wars despite the fact that is was not requested by the Pentagon. I think these priorities are wrong. I do not say that in a pejorative way. I say that in my judgment we can do a lot better for this country than those priorities. I mentioned yesterday that in this thick reconciliation plan, there are two little things buried--among dozens and dozens--that I bet nobody in the Chamber knew about. One is a provision to repeal the alternative minimum tax provisions we put in place in 1986. That little thing that nobody knows about means that 2,000 corporations will receive $7 million each in tax cuts. Let me say that again: 2,000 corporations will receive a tax cut of $7 million each. Another little provision is labeled 956(A). I bet no one in the Chamber knows what it is. Well, it deals with the repeal of the circumstance of deferral with respect to income that is deferred for tax purposes by foreign subsidiaries of American corporations. They have the money over there. Now, we have certain passive rules that say you have to repatriate the money you pay taxes on. This little nugget in here says we are going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to tell those companies that have moved jobs overseas, moved jobs out of this country: By the way, we are going to reward you even more for it. Those things do not make any sense. We ought not vote for a bill that includes things like that. I bet there is no one in the Senate who knew that provision was in that plan. I am talking about a couple little provisions--there are dozen and dozens and dozens of those little nuggets-- that say to big interests, special interests: Guess what? It is time to smile. We are offering up to you an enormous reward at a time when we say to kids, we do not have room for you in the Head Start Program; at a time when we say to kids benefiting from the Star Schools Program that we are sorry, you are going to have to cut back. My point is that this debate is about priorities and choices. All of us, it seems to me, in the coming days can do better. And I stand here as one who says let us balance the budget. Let us do it the right way. Let us all engage in debate about choices and agree. Seven years is just fine with me. In fact, we could do it within 5 if the Federal Reserve Board will take the boot off the neck of Americans and allow us a little economic growth. But let us discuss it together--the Senator from Rhode Island is absolutely right--use some common sense and do the right thing for this country. Mr. President, I thank you for your indulgence. I yield the floor. ",https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/18/senate-section/article/s17447-1?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22croatian%22%2C%22croatian%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1432,BOSNIA,"Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, earlier today Bosnia was discussed on the floor here. I wish to make a few remarks in that regard in the time allotted in morning business, because I think there is a great deal that is misunderstood about the peace process and our involvement in it and what our relationship is to the talks going on in Dayton. When we talk about the House, they had a lot of discussion in the House, and, of course, they had their vote over there, against any involvement in this or against going in militarily. But what has to be agreed to before we even get involved in any way, what has to be agreed to, is a complete peace agreement. It has to be agreed to, and not only agreed to but the firing has to have stopped before we move in. There are those who, apparently, assume we are going to have to fight our way in to establish peace and establish a peace as Tito did during the only period in modern history where there has been peace in Yugoslavia. That was a militarily imposed peace on the whole country. That is not the kind of peace we are talking about. There have to be two conditions met. First, there has to be an agreement. It has to be airtight. It has to be extremely detailed. It has to define exactly what the borders are. It has to define exactly which town is in what sector and what they have agreed to and signed up and said will be the new formation of those cities, those newly emerging countries in that area. So that agreement they are trying to work out in Dayton right now has to be in that fine a detail. It cannot be just a peace agreement that says we will move in and we hope we can establish peace. ``Yes, United States and NATO, you come and we know this will all work out.'' It is not that kind of agreement they are working toward. If I thought it was that kind of agreement, I would not be supporting this process whatsoever. What they are talking about is a very, very detailed agreement-- specific borders. Will this orchard be on this side? Whose territory will it be in? Will the next farm be in somebody else's territory? Will the road junction be in whose territory? That is the kind of detail they are trying to work out on huge maps out there in Dayton. I would say, it will be uphill at best that there will be any agreement coming out of that. I am still of the opinion that it is probably 60-40 against our ever being involved over there, because I doubt the parties will be able to come to that kind of definitive outline on a map as to who has what in their territory. It has to be that way or we should not get involved. Second, the firing has to have stopped. The firing has to have ceased. Obviously, the next question is, then, if they have that kind of commitment to peace, which they say they have, and that is the reason they are in Dayton talking, and they have come to a definitive peace agreement and firing has stopped, why does anybody need to go in? We were over there recently, just 1 month ago this weekend. Four weeks ago this weekend I was part of the Senator Stevens' Codel over there. We were briefed by our military leadership and by our people and U.N. people in Zagreb and Croatia. We flew into Sarajevo for a period of time, along with 21,000 pounds of peas on a C-130, and out again. We spent about half a day, which does not make us experts in that area, but it was interesting to see it, anyway. Then we came back through Brussels and talked to our Ambassadors there. But, when we were there, what we were so impressed with was there is a desire for peace. That is what has started this whole thing. The parties themselves say they are tired of war. The parties themselves say they want peace but are unable to get it. If we have the agreement and we have the cease-fire, why do we need to go? Here are the facts we were told while we were over there. It is estimated that about 20 to 50 percent of the people involved in the fighting there are what they call the irregulars. They are not people who are part of a regular, organized military militia that accepts commands from above or from Belgrade or anyplace else. They are people who are the irregulars. They are the farmers who are out cutting hay one day. They go up to the lines, up to the next village where there is a battle going on, they take a rifle from someone, they are in the lines for 3 or 4 days while someone else goes back to cut their hay. They are the people who, in the 30-some cease-fires that there have been over there so far, they are the ones who have violated the cease-fire because they basically do not take orders from anyone in particular. So the firing starts again, it spreads, and we have had 30- some cease-fires that have not worked. The fighting starts again. What is contemplated, and what our role would be over there--if we go in, if there is the airtight agreement, if the firing has stopped--then there would be zones set up between the parties along these borders, well-defined borders, where there would be 2- to 4-kilometer width areas in this that would be patrolled or would be monitored by the NATO forces, of which we would be about one-third of the total NATO force. I do not see that as being bad in that situation. Now, if there is firing by these irregulars or anyone else, we would put it down immediately. We would hope, because of the massive show of force we are putting in there, there would be no firing. If there is, it would be put down and put down immediately. It would be by NATO rules of engagement, not the U.N. rules of engagement. They are more of a debating society than anything else. But NATO rules of engagement say if you are fired on, you can obliterate that source. I asked General [[Page S 17448]] Joulwan, would we be permitted to take out anybody who fired on any of the NATO forces? Absolutely. That is key to the whole thing. Will there be any risk? I suppose there is. We have already had three people killed over there when we had Frasure, Kruzel, and Drew, who were in a vehicle that slid off the road and they were killed in the wreck. That is tragic. Our hearts go out to their families on this. I knew one of the gentlemen, Mr. Kruzel, in particular. It is a terrible thing that anybody is killed in a situation like this. But will there be any danger of accidents like that, or maybe somebody getting killed? There might be.

Well, it deals with the repeal of the circumstance of deferral with respect to income that is deferred for tax purposes by foreign subsidiaries of American corporations. They have the money over there. Now, we have certain passive rules that say you have to repatriate the money you pay taxes on. This little nugget in here says we are going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to tell those companies that have moved jobs overseas, moved jobs out of this country: By the way, we are going to reward you even more for it. Those things do not make any sense. We ought not vote for a bill that includes things like that. I bet there is no one in the Senate who knew that provision was in that plan. I am talking about a couple little provisions--there are dozen and dozens and dozens of those little nuggets-- that say to big interests, special interests: Guess what? It is time to smile. We are offering up to you an enormous reward at a time when we say to kids, we do not have room for you in the Head Start Program; at a time when we say to kids benefiting from the Star Schools Program that we are sorry, you are going to have to cut back. My point is that this debate is about priorities and choices. All of us, it seems to me, in the coming days can do better. And I stand here as one who says let us balance the budget. Let us do it the right way. Let us all engage in debate about choices and agree. Seven years is just fine with me. In fact, we could do it within 5 if the Federal Reserve Board will take the boot off the neck of Americans and allow us a little economic growth. But let us discuss it together--the Senator from Rhode Island is absolutely right--use some common sense and do the right thing for this country. Mr. President, I thank you for your indulgence. I yield the floor. ","['Mr. GLENN.', ' Mr. President, earlier today Bosnia was discussed on the floor here. I wish to make a few remarks in that regard in the time allotted in morning business, because I think there is a great deal that is misunderstood about the peace process and our involvement in it and what our relationship is to the talks going on in Dayton. When we talk about the House, they had a lot of discussion in the House, and, of course, they had their vote over there, against any involvement in this or against going in militarily. But what has to be agreed to before we even get involved in any way, what has to be agreed to, is a complete peace agreement. It has to be agreed to, and not only agreed to but the firing has to have stopped before we move in. There are those who, apparently, assume we are going to have to fight our way in to establish peace and establish a peace as Tito did during the only period in modern history where there has been peace in Yugoslavia. That was a militarily imposed peace on the whole country. That is not the kind of peace we are talking about. There have to be two conditions met. First, there has to be an agreement. It has to be airtight. It has to be extremely detailed. It has to define exactly what the borders are. It has to define exactly which town is in what sector and what they have agreed to and signed up and said will be the new formation of those cities, those newly emerging countries in that area. So that agreement they are trying to work out in Dayton right now has to be in that fine a detail. It cannot be just a peace agreement that says we will move in and we hope we can establish peace. ``Yes, United States and ', 'NATO,', "" you come and we know this will all work out.'' It is not that kind of agreement they are working toward. "", 'If I ', ""thought it was that kind of agreement, I would not be supporting this process whatsoever. What they are talking about is a very, very detailed agreement-- specific borders. Will this orchard be on this side? Whose territory will it be in? Will the next farm be in somebody else's territory? Will the road junction be in whose territory? That is the kind of detail they are trying to work out on huge maps out there in "", 'Dayton. I ', ""would say, it will be uphill at best that there will be any agreement coming out of that. I am still of the opinion that it is probably 60-40 against our ever being involved over there, because I doubt the parties will be able to come to that kind of definitive outline on a map as to who has what in their territory. It has to be that way or we should not get involved. Second, the firing has to have stopped. The firing has to have ceased. Obviously, the next question is, then, if they have that kind of commitment to peace, which they say they have, and that is the reason they are in Dayton talking, and they have come to a definitive peace agreement and firing has stopped, why does anybody need to go in? We were over there recently, just 1 month ago this weekend. Four weeks ago this weekend I was part of the Senator Stevens' Codel over there. We were briefed by our military leadership and by our people and U.N. people in Zagreb and Croatia. We flew into Sarajevo for a period of time, along with 21,000 pounds of peas on a C-130, and out again. We spent about half a day, which does not make us experts in that area, but it was interesting to see it, anyway. Then we came back through Brussels and talked to our Ambassadors there. But, when we were there, what we were so impressed with was there is a desire for peace. That is what has started this whole thing. The parties themselves say they are tired of war. The parties themselves say they want peace but are unable to get it. If we have the agreement and we have the cease-fire, why do we need to go? Here are the facts we were told while we were over there. It is estimated that about 20 to 50 percent of the people involved in the fighting there are what they call the irregulars. They are not people who are part of a regular, organized military militia that accepts commands from above or from Belgrade or anyplace else. They are people who are the irregulars. They are the farmers who are out cutting hay one day. They go up to the lines, up to the next village where there is a battle going on, they take a rifle from someone, they are in the lines for 3 or 4 days while someone else goes back to cut their hay. They are the people who, in the 30-some cease-fires that there have been over there so far, they are the ones who have violated the cease-fire because they basically do not take orders from anyone in particular. So the firing starts again, it spreads, and we have had 30- some cease-fires that have not worked. The fighting starts again. What is contemplated, and what our role would be over there--if we go in, if there is the airtight agreement, if the firing has stopped--then there would be zones set up between the parties along these borders, well-defined borders, where there would be 2- to 4-kilometer width areas in this that would be patrolled or would be monitored by the "", 'NATO ', 'forces, of which we would be about one-third of the total ', 'NATO ', 'force. I do not see that as being bad in that situation. Now, if there is firing by these irregulars or anyone else, we would put it down immediately. We would hope, because of the massive show of force we are putting in there, there would be no firing. If there is, it would be put down and put down immediately. It would be by ', 'NATO ', 'rules of engagement, not the U.N. rules of engagement. They are more of a debating society than anything else. ', 'But NATO ', 'rules of engagement say if you are fired on, you can obliterate that source. I asked General [[', 'Page S ', '17448]] Joulwan, would we be permitted to take out anybody who fired on any of the ', 'NATO ', 'forces? Absolutely. That is key to the whole thing. Will there be any risk? I suppose there is. We have already had three people killed over there when we had Frasure, Kruzel, and Drew, who were in a vehicle that slid off the road and they were killed in the wreck. That is tragic. Our hearts go out to their families on this. I knew one of the gentlemen, Mr. Kruzel, in particular. It is a terrible thing that anybody is killed in a situation like this. But will there be any danger of accidents like that, or maybe somebody getting killed? There might be. ', 'But I ', ""would also point out we do not withdraw the Peace Corps from overseas, and the Peace Corps in its history has had 224 people who have died overseas. I was surprised it was that high a number. I would have thought it would have been a very, very few, but the Peace Corps lost 224 people so far, to this date, since its inception. Like the old saying in aviation, ``How do you have complete, 100 percent aviation safety? You keep all the airplanes in the hangar. You do not risk them.'' Yet we know how much good we have done around the world by being involved to some extent. We have a Christian-Judeo heritage of helping people, alleviating suffering around the world. We supply food, we send out AID programs. Of course, we cannot solve all the world's problems, either with peaceful organizations or with the military. "", 'But I ', 'think an American leadership in the world has been such a force for good, I would hate to see us go back to trying to be an isolationist ', 'America. I ', 'repeat once again, we have to have an agreement, airtight. The firing has to have stopped. Then we go in with minimal risk, with our ', 'NATO ', 'allies, to try to keep that peace that has been eluding them so far, basically because of the irregulars who do not honor these cease- fires. Our leadership is important. We restored democracy in Haiti. In the process of doing that, of leading, we have been involved in bringing peace to the Middle East, working on it in Northern Ireland, we see Russian nuclear weapons are no longer aimed at our people. We secured the indefinite extension of a Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which was a big step forward. We achieved real progress toward a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. We reached an agreement with North Korea to end its nuclear weapons program. These are products of American leadership, and that is just a little, partial list. We have seen democracies growing in South America because of our involvement there. I think the risk over there, in that Bosnian area, if it is done pursuant to a well-thought-out agreement and a cease-fire, and we go in with a preponderance of force that people understand is going to be used if they break the peace and if they fire--to me is well worth the risk. Much has been made out of the fact that we want to provide leadership for ', 'NATO. I ', 'agree with that. I think our membership in ', 'NATO ', 'is very important. But that is not just the reason why we go in. That is pointed to, sometimes, as the reason we go in, in effect saying, ``There go our ', 'NATO ', 'people. We better rush out and lead them, because we are the biggest factor in ', 'NATO.', ""'' I will not agree with that. "", 'NATO ', 'has to be right. Let us judge this on whether it is right to go in, or wrong to go in, and try to get peace in that area where peace has not taken root for so long, and where some of the actions that have happened there in the past have literally been the sparks that set off two world wars. So, if we can bring peace to that area, to me it is well worth the risk. ', 'NATO ', 'leadership, I think, is, important, and ', 'NATO ', 'has been looked at by too many ', 'Americans, I ', 'believe, as just some sort of a remnant of the cold war, and let us forget it and move out of ', 'NATO.', ' Is it still important? I do believe ', 'NATO ', 'is important. It is important. ', 'NATO ', 'leadership is what is moving us into the organization for security and cooperation in Europe working with the European Union. We have a Partnership for Peace, which is in its fledgling days but becoming more and more important. The North Atlantic Cooperation Council was formed in 1991. That is moving ahead, and really is a good force for peace in that part of the world. We are the biggest factor in ', 'NATO. I ', 'think it is important that we retain that. ', 'But I ', 'do not see our leadership of ', 'NATO ', 'as just being the only reason we should move into that particular area. I know my time is up. Do not forget for 1 minute that we have to have an airtight agreement. We have to have a cease-fire, and on that basis we move in to try to give peace a chance in that very, very tough area of the world. I yield the floor. Several Senators addressed the Chair. ', 'The PRESIDING ', 'OFFICER ', '(Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from North Dakota. ', 'Mr. DORGAN.', ' Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are in morning business under a 10-minute rule. ', 'The PRESIDING ', 'OFFICER.', ' The Senator is correct. ', 'Mr. DORGAN.', ' Mr. ', 'President I ', ""wanted to respond to the Senator from Rhode Island and some others today. I found his remarks to be particularly interesting and helpful, and, as is often the case, I find myself agreeing with a fair amount of what he says. He is sensible, and moderate, which is probably difficult for many these days. I saw a cartoon recently in which someone was pointing at someone else and saying ``There is no room for moderates here.'' The fact is that there is a lot of room for moderates. There are moderates in both political parties who generally do not view things from the extremes and who want to solve problems. I hope we will find a way, using some common sense, to engage in an attempt to find solutions to some of the vexing problems we have in this country. The Senator from Georgia was on the floor talking about trash television a few moments ago. My sense is that people in this country are concerned about two principal areas, and he hit on one of those. One is economic security. The fact is that many Americans are having more trouble finding a job, and many others are finding that their wages are declining. Sixty percent of American families are working harder for less money and are losing income. This means less economic security. I think people are very concerned about that. They are also concerned about the diminution of values--the lowering of standards in this country. And part of that relates to trash television and violence on television. We can do something about some of these things, but not all of them. We must address some of the issues in the home and in the community. But some of these problems represent public policy areas as well. In the area of economic security, one of the things that is often discussed--and one that I agree with--is that we have to put our fiscal house in order at some point. We cannot continue to run enormous debts year after year. We cannot spend money we do not have forever. I would not have a problem if next year we spent $400 billion we did not have--and therefore incur a deficit next year of $400 billion--if with that $400 billion we cured cancer just like that. I would say that was a pretty good investment. You amortize that over the next 40, 50, 70 years, and it would be worth paying off the $400 billion deficit incurred to cure cancer. But that is not what these deficits are about. These are systemic deficits in the operating budgets of this country. You cannot continue that. You must address it. That is why I said last evening that I commend the majority party for a reconciliation bill that contains some things that are good. It contains some awful things as well, and I think some bad priorities. I am glad the President is going to veto it. I do not support it. But it has a good number of things that make a lot of sense. There are a good number of things in that reconciliation bill that both sides would agree to. But there are some major elements of the reconciliation bill that must be changed because, as we address the deficit in this country--and ultimately we must do it together--we must find a compromise. We should not ask the portion of the American people who have the least to bear the biggest burden of all the spending cuts, and then turn to the small portion of those who [["", 'Page S ', ""17449]] have the most and give them the largest share of the tax cuts. We have to try to fix some of those things. With respect to where we are today, the shutdown ought to end. The reconciliation bill is passed. The President is going to veto it. Negotiations, in my judgment, ought to begin immediately to try to find a solution to the impasse and a solution to the reconciliation bill. The question ought not be whether we have a reconciliation bill. The question is not whether we address the budget deficit and lead to a balanced budget. The question is, how do we do that? Not whether, but how? There is no good reason, in my judgment, to have a continued government shutdown. There is no juice left in that lemon for anybody-- not for any political party, and not for any political leader. This shutdown does not make any sense. I probably contribute to some of the concerns about the language that has been used during the shutdown. I read on the floor statements by the Speaker of the House, who in April said, ``We are going to create a titanic standoff and shut down the Government.'' Those are the facts. "", 'However, I ', ""am not saying that only one party is at fault here. The fact is that there is lots of room for blame. There has been lots of language uttered in these past few days that has caused a lot of chaos in the political system. But we find ourselves in a circumstance where we have people who say it is either our way or it is no way. If you do not do it our way, we will shut the Government down. The fact is Government works by consent. This is a democracy. For 200 years we have had impasses over wars, over depressions, over dozens and dozens of vexing, troublesome issues. The way those impasses have been solved is that people with good will, with common sense, have come together and said, ``Let us reason. Let us find a way to meet the goal, to work out this problem together.'' I want to mention a couple of things that were in the reconciliation bill which causes a lot of problems. Medicare--do we need to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare and Medicaid? Yes, we do. Not just in Medicare and Medicaid but in the price of health care generally for families, for businesses, for governments. The price of health care, the escalation of health care costs year after year somehow has to be addressed. But no one can any longer believe that what is in this reconciliation bill will address the price escalation in Medicare by saying to senior citizens you will have the same quality health care and you will not pay more for it. Everyone understands this approach means senior citizens will get less and pay more. The tax cut--many of us feel very strongly that the facts show every dollar of this tax cut will be borrowed. I would love to have somebody come and explain why that is not true. Regrettably, it is true. Every dollar of the proposed $245 billion tax cut will be borrowed and will add to the national debt, which adds to the burden of those children we have been talking about. On the car radio on the way in this morning, I heard a woman who had called the radio to talk about the shutdown. She said both of her parents, regrettably, have to go to a nursing home, one because of Alzheimer's and one who had a stroke. They have been there 5 years and started out with an asset base of $400,000 to $600,000. Now much of that is gone. She called and said, ``My worry is for when their assets are gone--and I believe that their assets should be used to pay for their care--my parents will not have an entitlement to Medicaid.'' When their assets are gone, under this new proposal, they will not have guaranteed coverage under Medicaid. That will be up to the States. Maybe the States will decide that nursing home care is an entitlement for her parents. Maybe not. She was worried about that. That is a significant change. That was in this budget reconciliation bill. I mentioned last evening the differences in spending priorities that have been talked about and for which the CR was fought over this weekend--cuts of 40 percent out of a little program called Star Schools; only $25 million is spent on Star Schools and that will be cut by 40 percent. The bill the Senate passed the other day, which I voted against, doubles the amount of money spent on star wars despite the fact that is was not requested by the "", 'Pentagon. I ', 'think these priorities are wrong. I do not say that in a pejorative way. I say that in my judgment we can do a lot better for this country than those priorities. I mentioned yesterday that in this thick reconciliation plan, there are two little things buried--among dozens and dozens--that I bet nobody in the Chamber knew about. One is a provision to repeal the alternative minimum tax provisions we put in place in 1986. That little thing that nobody knows about means that 2,000 corporations will receive $7 million each in tax cuts. Let me say that again: 2,000 corporations will receive a tax cut of $7 million each. Another little provision is labeled 956(A). I bet no one in the Chamber knows what it is. Well, it deals with the repeal of the circumstance of deferral with respect to income that is deferred for tax purposes by foreign subsidiaries of American corporations. They have the money over there. Now, we have certain passive rules that say you have to repatriate the money you pay taxes on. This little nugget in here says we are going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to tell those companies that have moved jobs overseas, moved jobs out of this country: By the way, we are going to reward you even more for it. Those things do not make any sense. We ought not vote for a bill that includes things like that. I bet there is no one in the Senate who knew that provision was in that plan. I am talking about a couple little provisions--there are dozen and dozens and dozens of those little nuggets-- that say to big interests, special interests: Guess what? It is time to smile. We are offering up to you an enormous reward at a time when we say to kids, we do not have room for you in the Head Start Program; at a time when we say to kids benefiting from the Star Schools Program that we are sorry, you are going to have to cut back. My point is that this debate is about priorities and choices. All of us, it seems to me, in the coming days can do better. ', 'And I ', 'stand here as one who says let us balance the budget. Let us do it the right way. Let us all engage in debate about choices and agree. Seven years is just fine with me.

71,"DEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996 The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill. Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas. Amendment No. 2843 Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I hope we can dispose of the pending amendment in short order. The committee reviewed all of these programs that the amendment proposes to fund. These are all of the so-called prevention programs that, when we debated this bill, we discussed at great length. What is being proposed here is to give money to the States for activities such as midnight basketball, and to pay for it by cutting the $80 million from the FBI. I remind my colleagues that when we passed the Anti-Terrorism Act, we authorized additional funding for the FBI. What I have tried to do in this bill is to provide some of that funding which we authorized. What we are being asked to do here is to go back and fund the very programs that we passed over because we did not think they were worthy, and we are being asked to pay for them by cutting the FBI. I think that if people could take a look at this amendment and decide whether they wanted these prevention programs or whether they wanted the money to go into law enforcement to grab violent criminals by the throat and not let them go to get a better grip, I think it would be a very clear choice. I am opposed to the amendment. I would be happy to have a voice vote on the amendment if the Senator is willing to do that. Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I will call for a rollcall vote, but I want to answer briefly what the Senator said. The FBI this coming year is funded at a 15-percent increase over last year. There is not a single request the FBI has made for funding that we have not authorized and are prepared to fund, without--without--this $80 million. This $80 million is over and above everything that the FBI has authorized, the President has requested and the House has funded. He talks about midnight basketball league, and that is a synonym for money that we think is wasted on prevention. As Senator Cohen pointed out, this money is block granted to States. They do not have to spend it on midnight basketball. We have decided that much of the money we are spending at the Federal level the States can spend much more effectively. You have made that argument time and time again. Let the Governors, let the local government spend the money, not Washington. That is what these crime prevention programs are aimed at. These crime prevention programs, if the Governors so wish, could be spent on programs like DARE. Everyone in this Chamber understands and recognizes that DARE is a program that works. So midnight basketball is not where these funds are going to be expended. They are going to be given to States and Governors and local governments to spend as they see fit. Again, the argument is that in any crimefighting bill, a certain amount of money, modest as it is, needs to be spent on trying to prevent it from occurring in the first place, and I do not think that there are any Senators, or many Senators in this Chamber who would not agree with this principle. And that is all this amendment intends to do. Several Senators addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, $80 million will be spent here by this amendment, our distinguished colleague talks about letting the States spend it, but we are not taking it away from Federal midnight basketball, we are not taking it away from Federal prevention programs. We are taking the money away from the FBI. We passed an antiterrorism bill by a vote of 91 to 8 authorizing funds for the FBI. All I have tried to do in this bill is to provide part of that funding. What we would be doing here is cutting the FBI to fund programs that may or may not do anything to prevent crime. The intentions of the program may be good. There are people who are strong proponents, for example, of midnight basketball. The point is, do we want to cut the FBI to fund it? I say no. I think this amendment should be rejected and it should be rejected soundly. Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. First of all, this is not about midnight basketball. That is a great thing to talk about. The States are not using this for midnight basketball. Let me tell you what they are using it for, to give you one example. I can pick almost any one of your States. The thing States use this money for, for example, is boys clubs and girls clubs. Let me tell you about boys clubs and girls clubs. There is a study the Judiciary Committee did and it has been done by others, and no one disputes it. If you put in a boys club and girls club--the study was done in Chicago and New York--you take two housing projects, the same type of housing projects, and put a boys club and girls club in the basement of one and no boys club and girls club in the basement of the other, the difference in the rate of crime is as follows: 31 percent fewer arrests in the project that has a boys club and girls club in it; 27 [[Page S 14646]] percent less use of drugs, arrest for drugs; and 19 percent fewer arrests for any acts of violence. As my dear old mother would say, an idle mind is a devil's workshop. You put these kids out there, and you have nothing for them. Let me tell you what these boys and girls clubs do with the money we have in here. One example: There is not a single one of these clubs that has midnight basketball. I will tell you what they have. They have the following deal: If you join the club and you are involved--and particularly, they put them in housing projects, which they are now doing in most of your States, putting in public housing projects. What they are required to do is to have computer classes before they can play in the gym. Second, they are required in a State like mine, and many of yours, to have mentoring programs. They bring the mentoring programs into the schools. Of the people who volunteer in the boys and girls clubs, 80 percent are uniformed police officers. Third, what they do is they get these kids into these programs, and part of the requirement to stay in the program and to be able to use the boys and girls club is you have to stay in school and have passing grades. What they have done is changed the culture in those communities. I will give you one example by limiting it to boys and girls clubs. YMCAs and church groups are all involved in these programs. We are not talking about midnight basketball. Second, we are talking about the weed and seed program, which started under President Bush. I can pick 50 quotes. I will pick one from a Republican U.S. Attorney from Georgia, Joe Whitley, former U.S. Attorney from the northern district of Georgia: I have said that this is the most important matter I have ever dealt with as U.S. Attorney. It's a simple but fundamentally sound idea that people in communities really seem to believe. . . . The program is responsive to the concerns of citizens. It's positive because residents thought it had real and credibility--combining law enforcement and prevention. I can talk about Michael Chertoff, former U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, a Republican, and Debra Daniels, former U.S. Attorney, southern district of Indiana, a Republican. The list goes on. Crime prevention is an issue that has been the subject of more misinformation and outright mischaracterization than perhaps any other in the crime debate-- Whether we should work to prevent crime before it happens, instead of waiting until after the shots are fired, until after our children become addicted to drugs, until after more Americans' lives are ruined. The anticrime law enacted last year answered that question unapologetically. In addition to fighting crime--the law made a commitment to preventing crime. A commitment supported by virtually every criminologist, every legal scholar, every sociologist, every psychologist, every medical authority, and nearly everyone's common sense. Those who study this issue agree that breaking the cycle of violence and crime requires an investment in the lives of our children-- With support and guidance to help them reject the violence and anarchy of the streets in favor of taking positive responsibility for their lives. In fact, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National District Attorneys Association, and the International Brotherhood of Police Officers cite prevention programs as critical to a long-term cure for crime. Prevention is what cops want--what virtually everyone in law enforcement wants. Every police officer I have talked to, every prosecutor, every prison warden, every probation officer says the same thing--we can't do it alone. And listen to local officials--the very people the Republicans say they want to give greater voice. Republican Mayors Giuliani of New York and Riordan of Los Angeles say this: By funding proven prevention programs for young people, the crime bill offers hope--hope that in the future we can reduce the need for so many police officers and jails. Listen to Paul Helmke, the Republican mayor of Fort Wayne, IN: It's a lot less expensive to do things on the prevention side than on the police side. And prevention of crime--particularly juvenile crime--is more important now than ever before. Last week the Department of Justice released its first national report on juvenile offenders and victims. The report found that between 1988 and 1992 the juvenile violent crime arrest rate has increased by more than 50 percent. It further estimated that even if the crime rate ceases to grow in future years, juvenile population growth alone would produce a 22 percent rise in violent crime arrests. Should the violent rate continue to grow as it has between 1988 and 1992, the number of juveniles arrested for violent crimes will double by the year 2010--to more than 260,000 arrests! Attorney General Janet Reno specifically cited prevention and intervention programs as one of the fundamental ways to combat this type of growth in juvenile crime. Prisons, though essential, are a testament to failure: They are the right place for people gone wrong. On the other hand, when a life about to go wrong is set back on the right track--that is a testament to hope. We build hope by showing children that they matter, by challenging disaffection with affection and respect, and by contrasting the dead- end of violence with the opportunity for a constructive life-- I would now like to briefly comment on the three programs in this amendment. local crime prevention block grants Local crime prevention block grants were created to allow cities and towns to develop their own prevention programs to combat child abuse, youth gangs, drug abuse by children, and crimes against the elderly-- including the D.A.R.E. Program and the boys and girls clubs. Local crime prevention grants enable communities to institute successful initiatives such as: Measures to prevent juvenile violence, juvenile gangs, and the use and sale of illegal drugs by juveniles, programs to prevent crimes against the elderly, midnight sports league programs to keep kids off the street and away from drugs, supervised sports and recreation programs after school and on holidays, the establishment of Boys and Girls Clubs of America in public housing facilities, and the creation of special crime units to deal with crimes in which a child is involved, to name a few. These prevention strategies and programs have proven effective in reducing the incidence of crime in both the short and long term. Here are some examples of programs that have proven track records: In hundreds of public housing projects across the country, boys and girls clubs give kids a safe place to hang out after school--a place with positive activities and positive role models. A recent, independent evaluation has reported that housing projects with clubs experience 13 percent fewer juvenile crimes, 22 percent less drug activity, and 25 percent less crack use, than do projects with clubs. In Honolulu, professionals identify families at risk for neglect or abuse when children are born and then visit their homes regularly over several years to help parents learn to care for their children. In Houston, Texas, a core of professionals provides one-on-one counseling, mentoring, tutoring, job training and crisis-intervention services to students at risk for dropping out. And in Delaware, ``Stormin' Normin'' Oliver runs an award-winning summer basketball league--in which team members must participate in supervised study sessions and perform community-service work in addition to their time on the courts. Although many communities are putting their best foot forward, the need and demand for prevention programs far outpace the supply. And yet the republicans have targeted prevention grants in the crime law for complete elimination--a move some charge is cold-hearted and mean. But I say it is just plain dumb. Local crime prevention block grants are one of the best means we have to ensure States and localities have the funding they need to reduce crime over the long haul. Weed and seed is a republican, Bush administration program, the brainchild of former Attorney General William Barr. The program funds prevention efforts and comprehensive law enforcement efforts. [[Page S 14647]] The weed and seed program has achieved notable success primarily because it requires the kind of community policing that works, and then requires that law enforcement, social service agencies, the private sector, and the community work together to prevent crime. So this is a program that works because it utilizes both law enforcement and community participation. In a number of cities--such as Madison, Houston, Trenton, and Camden--notable reductions in crime have been achieved in weed and seed areas. Many of weed and seed's biggest fans are former Republican U.S. attorneys. Let me tell you what a few of them have said: Joe Whitley, former U.S. attorney from the northern district of Georgia: I have said that this is the most important matter I have ever dealt with as U.S. attorney. It's a simple but fundamentally sound idea that people in communities really seemed to believe. * * * The program is responsive to the concerns of citizens. It's positive because residents thought it had real credibility--combining law enforcement and prevention. Michael Chertoff, former U.S. attorney for New Jersey: Trenton was a pilot city. It was a very successful project and I think very highly of it. * * * Community policing worked very well in closing the distance between the police and the community, and it deterred crime because it gave the police a better reputation within the community. Debra Daniels, former U.S. attorney from the southern district of Indiana: In a nutshell, it is the kind of program that you want. ``Program'' is the wrong word because it connotes money only--you want to emphasize the aspect of weed and seed that has to do with planning at the grassroots level. Weed and seed requires collaboration of all governmental agencies working closely at all levels with people in neighborhoods to create a complete package of crime fighting, policing, human services and economic development. * * * The community leadership development was miraculous and the crime rate decreased. The consensus of all the law enforcement experts around the country is that youth gangs are a serious problem and a growing problem. The most recent report on juvenile offenders from the office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention at the department of justice reports that the number of jurisdictions affected by youth gangs has increased substantially in the last 20 years and that gang- related crime has increased since the late 1980s. Yet very little is done to directly target youth gangs. This amendment would boost funds for the two Department of Justice programs that specifically target this problem. One of these is the gang free schools and communities program, which funds counseling, education, and crisis intervention through coordinated social service, substance abuse treatment and other means. The other is the community based gang intervention program, which: (1) develops regional task forces of state, local and community organizations to fight gangs; (2) encourages cooperation among local education, juvenile justice, employment, and social service agencies and community based organizations; and (3) funds programs offering effective punishment options, including restitution, community service, home detention, and boot camps. So this amendment provides an absolutely critical prevention element to our overall anti-crime efforts. The 1994 crime law provided over $300 million of authorized funding for prevention programs for the next year but the Republican appropriations bill eliminated virtually all of it. Offset: this amendment would restore $80 million--one quarter of the lost prevention funds--to fund these three programs. The money is taken from a portion of new FBI salaries and expenses that were increased above the president's request. I urge my colleagues to support this vital amendment. I will conclude by saying that I have great respect for the abilities of my friend from Texas. But this is about weed and seed and other good programs, not about midnight basketball. Whenever I debate him on issues relating to guns, he pulls out his mama's gun and says, ``You ain't going to take my mama's gun from her.'' I am not after his mama's gun or midnight basketball. This works. I challenge anybody in this Chamber to go home and ask 10 police chiefs in your State--10--and I am prepared to bet you that 9 of those 10 will tell you that they desperately need these local prevention programs. The reason they got put in the bill in the first place is because of the cops. Not a single social worker came to me and said: You have to put in prevention when this bill is written. Not one single bleeding heart liberal came to me and said: You have to put in prevention. The cops want the prevention money. Senators Cohen and Kohl are correct. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett], the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], the Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], and the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] are necessarily absent. I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] would vote ``nay.'' Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn], the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston], the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey], the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], and the Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon] are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote?

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was agreed to. Mr. COHEN. I move to lay that motion on the table was agreed to. The motion to lay that motion on the table. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am trying to work out an agreement here. I do not know that starting a debate on a new amendment moves us toward that objective. I would like to ask unanimous consent that debate on all amendments to this bill end, and that we proceed to third reading by 8:30. Mr. HOLLINGS. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Mr. HOLLINGS. I have to object to the request at this time. Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa. [[Page S 14648]] Amendment No. 2844 (Purpose: To restrict the location of judicial conferences and meetings, and for other purposes) Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and I ask for its consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the committee amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for himself, and Mr. Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 2844. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: On page 92, insert between lines 13 and 14 the following new sections: Sec. 305. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none of the funds made available under this title shall be used for any conference or meeting authorized under section 333 of title 28, United States Code, if such conference or meeting takes place at a location outside the geographic boundaries of the circuit court of appeals over which the chief judge presides, except in the case of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which shall be permitted to host conferences or meetings within a 50-mile radius of the District of Columbia without regard to the geographic boundaries of the circuit. (b) Of the funds appropriated under this title, no circuit shall receive more than $100,000 for conferences convened under section 333 of title 28, United States Code, during any year. Sec. 306. (a) Section 333 of title 28, United States Code, is amended-- (1) in the first paragraph, by striking ``shall'' the first, second, and fourth place it appears and inserting ``may''; and (2) in the second paragraph-- (A) by striking ``shall'' the first place it appears and inserting ``may''; and (B) by striking ``, and unless excused by the chief judge, shall remain throughout the conference''. (b) In the interest of saving taxpayer dollars and reducing the cost of Government, it is the sense of the Senate that the chief judges of the various United States circuit courts should use new communications technologies to conduct judicial conferences. (c) This section shall apply only to contracts entered into after the date of enactment of this Act. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment, on behalf of myself and Senator Kyl, that would stop a wasteful Government practice that has received a lot of press attention lately and has drawn sharp criticism from watchdog groups like the National Taxpayers Union. Mr. President, the practice I am talking about is taxpayer-funded travel by Federal judges to so-called judicial conferences. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, I am concerned about the budgetary propriety of continuing current practice with regard to judicial conferences in this new era of balanced budgets and streamlined Government. Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that two newspaper articles be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. The first article is entitled ``Taxpayers Foot the Bill for Judges to Meet at Resort'' and the second is entitled ``Times Are Tight, But Circuit Isn't.'' The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See exhibits 1 and 2.) Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I commend these revealing articles to my colleagues. In the first article, U.S. District Court judge, William Nickerson, is quoted as saying, ``As a taxpayer, I would probably complain,'' when asked about a judicial conference hosted at the five-star Greenbrier resort in West Virginia. The second article recounts that a Federal judge and former Congressman introduced a resolution to reduce the cost of judicial conferences in the ninth circuit by having them less frequently. Sadly, this responsible and wise proposal was defeated by a vote of 5 to 3. This amendment removes the requirement that conferences be held, giving Federal courts the flexibility to schedule conferences or, if they decide not to schedule them, just to not have a conference. In brief, Mr. President, the amendment will limit the location of judicial conferences to the geographic boundaries of the circuit to minimize travel costs which obviously come when there is travel outside of the circuit. It would also amend Federal law so that judicial conferences are no longer mandatory, and express the sense of the Senate that the Federal Judiciary should explore the idea of using new communications technology--teleconferencing, et cetera--to conduct conferences without travel. I believe the amendment will save money and give new and needed flexibility to the Federal courts. As I said, Federal judges from around the country are currently compelled by law to attend a conference with other judges at least once every 2 years. So, I cannot fault anyone with scheduling these conferences or attending them since the law requires it. But I can--and do--find fault with those who choose only the most luxurious hotels and resorts. I can--and do--find fault with some of the activities at these publicly funded conferences. According to some press reports, less than a third of the time judges spend at these conferences relates to judicial work. In one case, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper, during one 3-day conference at Hilton Head, SC, only 10 hours were set aside for work. The rest of the time was left open so that the attendees could socialize, visit with each other, or do whatever. Importantly, Federal courts are continuing these expensive conferences at the same time judicial resources are scarce and funds for representing poorer Americans are drying up. I respectfully submit that these are not sound priorities. The amendment that I and Senator Kyl offer today does what even some judges want to do. It would limit the location of judicial conferences to major urban areas--I want to emphasize this--within the circuit court of appeals, not outside. A few circuits, where judges are dissatisfied with the resorts within their circuit boundaries, have been going halfway across the country to attend a judicial conference-- at taxpayer expense. I am not the first to note the extravagance and unnecessary expense associated with these conferences. Fair-minded judges have been complaining about these conferences themselves for years. To name just a few, Circuit Judge Charles Wiggins, of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and U.S. District Court Judge Frederic Smalkin have both complained that these conferences are unjustifiably expensive. A few years ago, a district court judge in Kansas City, like Judge Wiggins in the ninth circuit, was so outraged by the posh, remote resorts where these conferences are hosted that he introduced a resolution to limit the location of conferences. Yet another judge has referred to judicial conferences as a sort of ``camp.'' And U.S. District Court Judge Carl Rubin was quoted by the Cleveland Plain Dealer as saying ``there are a lot of things I'd rather see the taxpayers' money spent on than sending me to Hilton Head for 3 days.'' According to that same article, Pete Seep of the National Taxpayers' Union states his opinion that ``Federal taxpayers are paying judges to party.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters written to me by Federal judges--one from Michigan and one from Texas--urging me to trim the excesses associated with judicial conferences be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. Bankruptcy court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Flint, MI, July 6, 1995. Re Travel/Chambers savings. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Chairman, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, Washington, DC. Dear Senator Grassley: I read in a recent article in the Wall Street Journal how you were trying to effectuate needed savings in the budget for the federal judiciary. As a member of the lowest rung on the ladder of the federal judiciary, I offer two suggestions for savings within the judicial branch. I have been a bankruptcy judge for 11 years. As you know, federal judges are required by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 333 to attend a judicial conference each year. The first year I attended such a conference, it occurred to me that there was a place where some savings could be effected. In my experience, the judicial conferences are arranged so that the judges travel usually on a Tuesday and return home on a Friday or Saturday. As you are well aware, commercial airlines give tremendous discounts for early booking with a Saturday night stayover. The thought came [[Page S 14649]] to mind long ago that if judges were required to attend the conference over a Saturday night, it could save a lot of money. This concept holds true for Federal Judicial Center functions as well. My suggestion was met with the response that judges prefer to be home with their families on the weekends. While that is obviously true (when I suggested this, I had two small children at home, ages eight and five), I did not think it was too much to ask high government officials to give up a weekend once in a while, especially since such a large savings would be created. Now that funding is much tighter, I repeat this suggestion. Another suggestion deals with the cost of furnishing chambers. Due to expansion in the district court, I was asked to move my courtrooms and chambers out of the federal buildings in Flint and Bay City. In the process, I was given a budget for furnishing chambers (which included my personal office, my secretary's office and reception area, my law clerk's office, the library, the media room, two attorney conference rooms, and the courtroom waiting area) for $25,000 total. We just about made it for that amount. I do not know for sure, but I have been told that other judges are allowed roughly $50,000 for furnishing a much smaller chambers' unit. Perhaps some uniformity would save some money. While I am in accord with the statements of the federal judge quoted in the Journal article with respect to there being a need for decorum and dignity in a federal courthouse, I also concur in your efforts and those of Senator Baucus to provide that at a lower cost. By effectuating some reasonable savings in non-essential areas, Congress ought to be able to reinstitute cost of living increases for the judiciary. Without such regular adjustments, of course, Congress is condemning the judiciary to consistent decreases in take-home pay. Sincerely, Arthur J. Spector, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge. ____ U.S. District Court, Western District of Texas, San Antonio, TX, June 6, 1995. Hon. Charles E. Grassley, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC Dear Senator Grassley: At a recent conference of the Fifth Judicial Circuit, we were advised of your efforts to address government expenditures for judicial meetings and conferences. I applaud and encourage such efforts. All branches of government must search for and find ways of reducing government expense. This area can be modified, relatively painlessly, with no loss in the quality of judicial services provided. Title 28 U.S.C. Section 333 allows an annual circuit conferences and requires that one be held in each circuit no more than every two years. Attendances for judges summoned is mandatory. Perhaps Section 333 could be amended to reduce the number of circuit conferences and/or permit participation to be optional. Once per year, we also hold separate workshops for circuit judges, district judges, magistrate judges, and bankruptcy judges. These instructional meetings address various substantive topics and can be beneficial. However, the information can be provided to us in written form at our offices to avoid the cost of travel, housing, meals, and lectures. I am sure many more ways of reducing expenses for judicial meetings exist. These meetings can be valuable but are not absolutely necessary to the administration of justice. Particularly in these economic times, their cost is difficult to justify. I wanted you to know that judges will support, and even participate in, efforts to reduce the amount of money allocated to the judiciary's budget. Sincerly, John W. Primomo, U.S. Magistrate Judge. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I believe that the costs of conferences are underestimated. These estimates--which range as high as one-half million dollars per conference--do not take into account lost time on the bench for judges and their support staff, who also attend the conferences at taxpayer expense. And the taxpayers foot these expenses year after year. The party's over, Mr. President. There is a word for this sort of thing: Boondoggle. I have fought against wasting taxpayer money my whole career in the Senate, and I am committed to fighting unnecessary spending in the judiciary. Mr. President, under current law, Federal judges are required to host and attend these conferences. This amendment will change that so that judges have the flexibility not to call a judicial conference. This amendment would also give individual Federal judges the option of not attending a conference. This is fair, and permits Federal courts--which I believe will act responsibly in light of the Federal Government's budgetary constraints--to pitch in and tighten belts along with us in Congress and the executive branch. As I have said, Mr. President, this amendment is about saving taxpayer dollars and priorities. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Finally, I just want to say that this amendment should not be viewed as a general indictment of the Federal judiciary. For the most part, I think that the judiciary has taken responsible and important steps to reduce unnecessary spending. This amendment is simply targeted to a use of Federal funds that, in the opinion of this Senator, should be pruned. Thank you, Mr. President. Exhibit 1 [From the Baltimore Sun, June 30, 1994] Taxpayers Foot the Bill for Judges to Meet at Resort (by Marcia Myers) As the federal judiciary struggles amid hiring freezes and funding shortages for basic services, 150 judges from Maryland and other parts of the Fourth Circuit converged yesterday on the broad verandas, lush fairways and tennis courts of the five-star Greebrier resort. Their taxpayer-financed gathering will demand little work in the afternoons and barely any at night--unless you count one banquet and a sing-along led by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. Of course, several hundred lawyers pay their own way, and those who consider schmoozing part of the job might argue that they're working tirelessly. The cost to taxpayers for the four-day conference: about $200,000. Even some who appreciate the Greenbrier's pampering question the propriety of the trip to the mountains of White Sulphur Springs, W.Va. ``As a taxpayer, I would probably complain,'' U.S. District Judge William M. Nickerson said, while adding that the meeting offers a good opportunity to talk informally with other judges. ``I think a lot of the judges have some concerns as taxpayers. Some feel it's more of a luxury than it needs to be.'' Others are more direct in criticizing the annual conference, for which taxpayers will pay up to $1,000 per judge plus travel expenses. ``I don't think the expense is justified on an annual basis,'' said U.S. District Judge Frederic N. Smalkin. Consider the schedule for the conference, which includes district, magistrate and bankruptcy judges from Maryland, North and South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia: Day 1: Judges arrive--no activities are planned. Day 2: Judges attend a morning session for about 3 hours to discuss court business. No other activities are planned until the Rehnquist sing-along that evening. Day 3: A trio of one-hour lectures on ethics is scheduled. At noon, the six new judges in the circuit offer brief remarks. Nothing else is planned until an evening reception and banquet. Day 4: The morning features a panel discussion reviewing major Supreme Court decisions of the 1993 term. That ends the conference, although judges on committees may attend additional meetings. Meanwhile, conferees are encouraged to sign up for group activities that include tennis, golf, bridge and hiking. Among the resort's other amenities: three 18-hole championship golf courses, fly fishing, skeet shooting, horseback riding, swimming, and the Greenbrier Spa, Mineral Baths & Salon. ``Personally, I think it's of real value,'' Senior U.S. District Judge John R. Hargrove said of the conference. ``Do we have to cut our own throats just because Congress won't give us more money? We still have to have training. We don't go down there and sit around.'' Why not have a shorter meeting, strictly business, at a less luxurious spot? ``We tried that at least once in the 20 years since I came here,'' said the circuit's Chief Judge, Sam J. Ervin III of North Carolina. ``The afternoon sessions were not very productive--nobody much came. ``I think the most important thing about this conference is that lawyers have an opportunity to mingle with the judges and share their problems and difficulties.'' That talk could include concerns over the shrinking resources of the federal courts. Amid a hiring freeze in Maryland and across the nation, the courts are at 84 percent of adequate staffing levels--the lowest ever, according to a court official. And the situation could get worse. Court officials worry about funds for court security, courtroom deputies and computers. Business that used to be done in a day in Baltimore, for example, now can take several days because of staffing shortages. When asked how much the conference would cost taxpayers, Circuit Executive Samuel W. Phillips said about $55,000. But after acknowledging the $1,000 allowance for each judge, plus travel and administrative expenses, he estimated the cost at $175,000 to $200,000. Mr. Phillips said he had checked many other hotels for a better rate. But the Greenbrier includes two meals in its room rate, which makes it cheaper, he said. A typical room for two costs $434 a night, although the judges receive a discount that he wouldn't disclose. It's also one of the few hotels capable of accommodating everybody--judges, spouses and lawyers--under one roof, he said. The government pays for judges' hotel rooms and meals. The cost of recreation--at [[Page S 14650]] the Greenbrier, golf fees are $80 and tennis courts are $23 an hour-- comes from each judge's own pocket. The conference alternates every other year between the Greenbrier and the Homestead, a similar resort in Hot Springs, Va. The judges are quick to note that attendance is required-- by law. Congress passed a bill in the 1930s requiring judges in each circuit to gather annually to consider court business. As budget concerns have mounted in recent years, the law was amended to require a meeting only once every two years. Several circuits have cut back to biennial meetings, but Judge Ervin said the Fourth Circuit had rejected that idea. [From the Recorder, September 29, 1993] Times Are Tights, But Circuit Isn't (By Steve Albert) Soon after money problems forced postponement of pay raises for judicial employees and led federal judges to suspend civil jury trials, the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals spent about $600,000 to send 350 judges and lawyers to a four-day conference at a luxury Santa Barbara beach resort. While other circuits reacted to tight budgets this year by canceling their retreats or deciding to hold them every other year, the Ninth Circuit opted to go forward with its August 1993 conference and continue holding its retreat annually. Circuit chief Judge J. Clifford Wallace called the conference expenditures ``money well spent.'' Congress mandates that circuits hold conferences, Wallace said, and the retreats provide the only opportunity ``to bring together people who have responsibility to improve the administration of justice.'' Circuit and district judges, magistrates, bankruptcy judges, U.S. attorneys, federal public defenders and court clerks from nine Western states attend the conference. In addition, the circuit's 27 active judges get together six times a year, hold an annual winter symposium, and meet with different judges once every year or two for continuing education. Estimates of government expenses for the Santa Barbara conference were released last week shortly before the U.S. House of Representatives appropriated $2.8 billion for the judiciary for fiscal 1994, a 10 percent increase over this year. A House/Senate conference committee is expected to settle on the final number this week or next. The Senate wants to give this judiciary just a 5 percent increase for the new fiscal year, which begins Friday. The cost estimate of the Ninth Circuit conference, prepared by circuit executives at The Recorder's request, shows that 300 judges, prosecutors, public defenders and clerks traveled to Santa Barbara by air at an average cost of $550 each. Another 50 traveled by car from Los Angeles at an average cost of $50. The attendees spent an average of $250 for room and food each day of the four-day conference and an average of $34 on check-out day. Add in about $27,000 for such items as speakers' travel, printing and audiovisual material, and the total bill for taxpayers was about $556,000. Because judges submit individual expense vouchers, that figure is an estimate only. The figure does not include the cost of travel during the rest of the year for the 12 judges who meet four times annually to help plan the conference. About 100 other attendees, mostly lawyers in private practice, paid their own way. $100 million bailout The conference came just eight months after the U.S. Judicial Conference--the governing body of the federal courts--imposed a hiring freeze and postponed some pay increases for federal court employees in the Ninth Circuit and around the country. At the same time, the Judicial Conference's executive committee trimmed court operating expenses as well as probation and pretrial services funding, citing a $100 million operating shortfall. In June, citing a lack of funds to pay jurors, federal trial courts around the country briefly suspended some civil jury trials, Congress passed a $100 million bailout for the courts in early July. The budget shortfall prompted Wallace in May to propose that many indigents who need court-appointed lawyers be asked to repay the government for the cost of their defense, much as students are required to pay off student loans for college tuition. The savings, he theorized, could be used to avoid funding shortfalls. But Wallace said Monday that despite budgetary problems, the conference remained an essential expense. He cited the circuit's recently released study of gender bias in the courts and its decision to study bias based on race, religion and ethnicity as examples of the work the conference takes on. ``No one can doubt the importance of those issues,'' Wallace said. ``It would be difficult to cut the conference because of budget difficulty.'' Other circuits around the country have cancelled their annual conferences, however. The New York-based Second Circuit and Denver-based Tenth Circuit cancelled their 1993 meetings, and the St. Louis-based Eighth Circuit has cancelled its 1994 conference. Four other circuits have gone to biennial conferences. A call to cancel future Ninth Circuit conferences was defeated by a 5-3 vote of the circuit's executive committee at its August meeting in Santa Barbara. Circuit Judge Charles Wiggins, a former Republican congressman, warned colleagues then that the cost could engender the wrong ``public perception,'' especially in tight budget times. Executive committee members voted to go ahead with the circuit's 1994 conference in San Diego and its 1995 conference in Hawaii. Exactly how much the Ninth Circuit or other circuits spend on annual conferences is difficult to pinpoint, according to circuit executives and a spokesman for the U.S. Administrative Office of the Courts, which disburses money to the federal bench. Judges submit conference expense vouchers and reimbursement checks are issued in Washington. The Ninth Circuit cost estimates were based on average airfare costs calculated by circuit executives and the $250 maximum per day charge judges and other government employees are allowed for lodging and food. Circuit conference expenses are subtracted from the ``Salaries and Expenses'' line of the courts' budget. Individual circuit expenses are never set forth in judicial budget requests, said David Sellers, a spokesman for the administrative office of the courts. ``It doesn't get much more specific than that,'' Sellers said. New Jersey District Chief Judge John Gerry, who chairs the Judicial Conference's executive committee, said the Ninth Circuit's conference cost estimate was the first such estimate he had ever heard. The executive committee, which holds the Judicial Conference's purse strings, does not take up or examine individual circuit expenditures, he said. But the conference a year ago asked circuits to evaluate the necessity of retreats and their costs. ``There hasn't been any area of court operations we have not looked at to save a buck here and there,'' Gerry said. His own circuit, the Third, has gone to biennial conferences. a model circuit Wallace said the work of the Ninth Circuit conference has been recognized by other circuits. ``Some of us do a better job than others in our efforts to improve the system,'' Wallace said. If efforts were not made to improve the administration of justice, he added, costs of administering the courts could be higher than they already are. ``The budgeting problem is very complicated,'' Wallace said. ``By singling out one aspect, the overall picture can be blurred. We have thrashed this out. We have been responsible.'' But some circuit judges like Wiggins have complained that the conference is not as productive as Wallace or others may think. ``We don't talk about much of interest to any of us; our discussions are so broad,'' Wiggins told his colleagues in Santa Barbara. At the Santa Barbara meeting, conferees discussed cooperation with the executive and legislative branches and, in addition to passing a resolution calling for a task force to study bias, passed one supporting adequate funding for the courts. Savings in conference costs would not have offset lack of funds for jury trials or public defender programs because those costs come out of different budget lines than the line used to pay for conferences, said Wallace and court spokesman Sellers. This year's conference schedule, like those in the past, included such diversions as tennis and golf tournaments, a spouse sightseeing and winery tour and cooking and flower arranging classes. Wallace confirmed that the Ninth Circuit conference next August will be held at the Loews Coronado Bay Resort on the beach south of San Diego. The resorts offers bayside suites and has three heated pools and a marina.

Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas. Amendment No. 2843 Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I hope we can dispose of the pending amendment in short order. The committee reviewed all of these programs that the amendment proposes to fund. These are all of the so-called prevention programs that, when we debated this bill, we discussed at great length. What is being proposed here is to give money to the States for activities such as midnight basketball, and to pay for it by cutting the $80 million from the FBI. I remind my colleagues that when we passed the Anti-Terrorism Act, we authorized additional funding for the FBI. What I have tried to do in this bill is to provide some of that funding which we authorized. What we are being asked to do here is to go back and fund the very programs that we passed over because we did not think they were worthy, and we are being asked to pay for them by cutting the FBI. I think that if people could take a look at this amendment and decide whether they wanted these prevention programs or whether they wanted the money to go into law enforcement to grab violent criminals by the throat and not let them go to get a better grip, I think it would be a very clear choice. I am opposed to the amendment. I would be happy to have a voice vote on the amendment if the Senator is willing to do that. Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I will call for a rollcall vote, but I want to answer briefly what the Senator said. The FBI this coming year is funded at a 15-percent increase over last year. There is not a single request the FBI has made for funding that we have not authorized and are prepared to fund, without--without--this $80 million. This $80 million is over and above everything that the FBI has authorized, the President has requested and the House has funded. He talks about midnight basketball league, and that is a synonym for money that we think is wasted on prevention. As Senator Cohen pointed out, this money is block granted to States. They do not have to spend it on midnight basketball. We have decided that much of the money we are spending at the Federal level the States can spend much more effectively. You have made that argument time and time again. Let the Governors, let the local government spend the money, not Washington. That is what these crime prevention programs are aimed at. These crime prevention programs, if the Governors so wish, could be spent on programs like DARE. Everyone in this Chamber understands and recognizes that DARE is a program that works. So midnight basketball is not where these funds are going to be expended. They are going to be given to States and Governors and local governments to spend as they see fit. Again, the argument is that in any crimefighting bill, a certain amount of money, modest as it is, needs to be spent on trying to prevent it from occurring in the first place, and I do not think that there are any Senators, or many Senators in this Chamber who would not agree with this principle. And that is all this amendment intends to do. Several Senators addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, $80 million will be spent here by this amendment, our distinguished colleague talks about letting the States spend it, but we are not taking it away from Federal midnight basketball, we are not taking it away from Federal prevention programs. We are taking the money away from the FBI. We passed an antiterrorism bill by a vote of 91 to 8 authorizing funds for the FBI. All I have tried to do in this bill is to provide part of that funding. What we would be doing here is cutting the FBI to fund programs that may or may not do anything to prevent crime. The intentions of the program may be good. There are people who are strong proponents, for example, of midnight basketball. The point is, do we want to cut the FBI to fund it? I say no. I think this amendment should be rejected and it should be rejected soundly. Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. First of all, this is not about midnight basketball. That is a great thing to talk about. The States are not using this for midnight basketball. Let me tell you what they are using it for, to give you one example. I can pick almost any one of your States. The thing States use this money for, for example, is boys clubs and girls clubs. Let me tell you about boys clubs and girls clubs. There is a study the Judiciary Committee did and it has been done by others, and no one disputes it. If you put in a boys club and girls club--the study was done in Chicago and New York--you take two housing projects, the same type of housing projects, and put a boys club and girls club in the basement of one and no boys club and girls club in the basement of the other, the difference in the rate of crime is as follows: 31 percent fewer arrests in the project that has a boys club and girls club in it; 27 [[Page S 14646]] percent less use of drugs, arrest for drugs; and 19 percent fewer arrests for any acts of violence. As my dear old mother would say, an idle mind is a devil's workshop. You put these kids out there, and you have nothing for them. Let me tell you what these boys and girls clubs do with the money we have in here. One example: There is not a single one of these clubs that has midnight basketball. I will tell you what they have. They have the following deal: If you join the club and you are involved--and particularly, they put them in housing projects, which they are now doing in most of your States, putting in public housing projects. What they are required to do is to have computer classes before they can play in the gym. Second, they are required in a State like mine, and many of yours, to have mentoring programs. They bring the mentoring programs into the schools. Of the people who volunteer in the boys and girls clubs, 80 percent are uniformed police officers. Third, what they do is they get these kids into these programs, and part of the requirement to stay in the program and to be able to use the boys and girls club is you have to stay in school and have passing grades. What they have done is changed the culture in those communities. I will give you one example by limiting it to boys and girls clubs. YMCAs and church groups are all involved in these programs. We are not talking about midnight basketball. Second, we are talking about the weed and seed program, which started under President Bush. I can pick 50 quotes. I will pick one from a Republican U.S. Attorney from Georgia, Joe Whitley, former U.S. Attorney from the northern district of Georgia: I have said that this is the most important matter I have ever dealt with as U.S. Attorney. It's a simple but fundamentally sound idea that people in communities really seem to believe. . . . The program is responsive to the concerns of citizens. It's positive because residents thought it had real and credibility--combining law enforcement and prevention. I can talk about Michael Chertoff, former U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, a Republican, and Debra Daniels, former U.S. Attorney, southern district of Indiana, a Republican. The list goes on. Crime prevention is an issue that has been the subject of more misinformation and outright mischaracterization than perhaps any other in the crime debate-- Whether we should work to prevent crime before it happens, instead of waiting until after the shots are fired, until after our children become addicted to drugs, until after more Americans' lives are ruined. The anticrime law enacted last year answered that question unapologetically. In addition to fighting crime--the law made a commitment to preventing crime. A commitment supported by virtually every criminologist, every legal scholar, every sociologist, every psychologist, every medical authority, and nearly everyone's common sense. Those who study this issue agree that breaking the cycle of violence and crime requires an investment in the lives of our children-- With support and guidance to help them reject the violence and anarchy of the streets in favor of taking positive responsibility for their lives. In fact, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National District Attorneys Association, and the International Brotherhood of Police Officers cite prevention programs as critical to a long-term cure for crime. Prevention is what cops want--what virtually everyone in law enforcement wants. Every police officer I have talked to, every prosecutor, every prison warden, every probation officer says the same thing--we can't do it alone. And listen to local officials--the very people the Republicans say they want to give greater voice. Republican Mayors Giuliani of New York and Riordan of Los Angeles say this: By funding proven prevention programs for young people, the crime bill offers hope--hope that in the future we can reduce the need for so many police officers and jails. Listen to Paul Helmke, the Republican mayor of Fort Wayne, IN: It's a lot less expensive to do things on the prevention side than on the police side. And prevention of crime--particularly juvenile crime--is more important now than ever before. Last week the Department of Justice released its first national report on juvenile offenders and victims. The report found that between 1988 and 1992 the juvenile violent crime arrest rate has increased by more than 50 percent. It further estimated that even if the crime rate ceases to grow in future years, juvenile population growth alone would produce a 22 percent rise in violent crime arrests. Should the violent rate continue to grow as it has between 1988 and 1992, the number of juveniles arrested for violent crimes will double by the year 2010--to more than 260,000 arrests! Attorney General Janet Reno specifically cited prevention and intervention programs as one of the fundamental ways to combat this type of growth in juvenile crime. Prisons, though essential, are a testament to failure: They are the right place for people gone wrong. On the other hand, when a life about to go wrong is set back on the right track--that is a testament to hope. We build hope by showing children that they matter, by challenging disaffection with affection and respect, and by contrasting the dead- end of violence with the opportunity for a constructive life-- I would now like to briefly comment on the three programs in this amendment. local crime prevention block grants Local crime prevention block grants were created to allow cities and towns to develop their own prevention programs to combat child abuse, youth gangs, drug abuse by children, and crimes against the elderly-- including the D.A.R.E. Program and the boys and girls clubs. Local crime prevention grants enable communities to institute successful initiatives such as: Measures to prevent juvenile violence, juvenile gangs, and the use and sale of illegal drugs by juveniles, programs to prevent crimes against the elderly, midnight sports league programs to keep kids off the street and away from drugs, supervised sports and recreation programs after school and on holidays, the establishment of Boys and Girls Clubs of America in public housing facilities, and the creation of special crime units to deal with crimes in which a child is involved, to name a few. These prevention strategies and programs have proven effective in reducing the incidence of crime in both the short and long term. Here are some examples of programs that have proven track records: In hundreds of public housing projects across the country, boys and girls clubs give kids a safe place to hang out after school--a place with positive activities and positive role models. A recent, independent evaluation has reported that housing projects with clubs experience 13 percent fewer juvenile crimes, 22 percent less drug activity, and 25 percent less crack use, than do projects with clubs. In Honolulu, professionals identify families at risk for neglect or abuse when children are born and then visit their homes regularly over several years to help parents learn to care for their children. In Houston, Texas, a core of professionals provides one-on-one counseling, mentoring, tutoring, job training and crisis-intervention services to students at risk for dropping out. And in Delaware, ``Stormin' Normin'' Oliver runs an award-winning summer basketball league--in which team members must participate in supervised study sessions and perform community-service work in addition to their time on the courts. Although many communities are putting their best foot forward, the need and demand for prevention programs far outpace the supply. And yet the republicans have targeted prevention grants in the crime law for complete elimination--a move some charge is cold-hearted and mean. But I say it is just plain dumb. Local crime prevention block grants are one of the best means we have to ensure States and localities have the funding they need to reduce crime over the long haul. Weed and seed is a republican, Bush administration program, the brainchild of former Attorney General William Barr. The program funds prevention efforts and comprehensive law enforcement efforts. [[Page S 14647]] The weed and seed program has achieved notable success primarily because it requires the kind of community policing that works, and then requires that law enforcement, social service agencies, the private sector, and the community work together to prevent crime. So this is a program that works because it utilizes both law enforcement and community participation. In a number of cities--such as Madison, Houston, Trenton, and Camden--notable reductions in crime have been achieved in weed and seed areas. Many of weed and seed's biggest fans are former Republican U.S. attorneys. Let me tell you what a few of them have said: Joe Whitley, former U.S. attorney from the northern district of Georgia: I have said that this is the most important matter I have ever dealt with as U.S. attorney. It's a simple but fundamentally sound idea that people in communities really seemed to believe. * * * The program is responsive to the concerns of citizens. It's positive because residents thought it had real credibility--combining law enforcement and prevention. Michael Chertoff, former U.S. attorney for New Jersey: Trenton was a pilot city. It was a very successful project and I think very highly of it. * * * Community policing worked very well in closing the distance between the police and the community, and it deterred crime because it gave the police a better reputation within the community. Debra Daniels, former U.S. attorney from the southern district of Indiana: In a nutshell, it is the kind of program that you want. ``Program'' is the wrong word because it connotes money only--you want to emphasize the aspect of weed and seed that has to do with planning at the grassroots level. Weed and seed requires collaboration of all governmental agencies working closely at all levels with people in neighborhoods to create a complete package of crime fighting, policing, human services and economic development. * * * The community leadership development was miraculous and the crime rate decreased. The consensus of all the law enforcement experts around the country is that youth gangs are a serious problem and a growing problem. The most recent report on juvenile offenders from the office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention at the department of justice reports that the number of jurisdictions affected by youth gangs has increased substantially in the last 20 years and that gang- related crime has increased since the late 1980s. Yet very little is done to directly target youth gangs. This amendment would boost funds for the two Department of Justice programs that specifically target this problem. One of these is the gang free schools and communities program, which funds counseling, education, and crisis intervention through coordinated social service, substance abuse treatment and other means. The other is the community based gang intervention program, which: (1) develops regional task forces of state, local and community organizations to fight gangs; (2) encourages cooperation among local education, juvenile justice, employment, and social service agencies and community based organizations; and (3) funds programs offering effective punishment options, including restitution, community service, home detention, and boot camps. So this amendment provides an absolutely critical prevention element to our overall anti-crime efforts. The 1994 crime law provided over $300 million of authorized funding for prevention programs for the next year but the Republican appropriations bill eliminated virtually all of it. Offset: this amendment would restore $80 million--one quarter of the lost prevention funds--to fund these three programs. The money is taken from a portion of new FBI salaries and expenses that were increased above the president's request. I urge my colleagues to support this vital amendment. I will conclude by saying that I have great respect for the abilities of my friend from Texas. But this is about weed and seed and other good programs, not about midnight basketball. Whenever I debate him on issues relating to guns, he pulls out his mama's gun and says, ``You ain't going to take my mama's gun from her.'' I am not after his mama's gun or midnight basketball. This works. I challenge anybody in this Chamber to go home and ask 10 police chiefs in your State--10--and I am prepared to bet you that 9 of those 10 will tell you that they desperately need these local prevention programs. The reason they got put in the bill in the first place is because of the cops. Not a single social worker came to me and said: You have to put in prevention when this bill is written. Not one single bleeding heart liberal came to me and said: You have to put in prevention. The cops want the prevention money. Senators Cohen and Kohl are correct. I yield the floor.

The motion to lay that motion on the table. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am trying to work out an agreement here. I do not know that starting a debate on a new amendment moves us toward that objective. I would like to ask unanimous consent that debate on all amendments to this bill end, and that we proceed to third reading by 8:30. Mr. HOLLINGS. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Mr. HOLLINGS. I have to object to the request at this time. Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa. [[Page S 14648]] Amendment No. 2844 (Purpose: To restrict the location of judicial conferences and meetings, and for other purposes) Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and I ask for its consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the committee amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for himself, and Mr. Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 2844. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: On page 92, insert between lines 13 and 14 the following new sections: Sec. 305. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none of the funds made available under this title shall be used for any conference or meeting authorized under section 333 of title 28, United States Code, if such conference or meeting takes place at a location outside the geographic boundaries of the circuit court of appeals over which the chief judge presides, except in the case of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which shall be permitted to host conferences or meetings within a 50-mile radius of the District of Columbia without regard to the geographic boundaries of the circuit. (b) Of the funds appropriated under this title, no circuit shall receive more than $100,000 for conferences convened under section 333 of title 28, United States Code, during any year. Sec. 306. (a) Section 333 of title 28, United States Code, is amended-- (1) in the first paragraph, by striking ``shall'' the first, second, and fourth place it appears and inserting ``may''; and (2) in the second paragraph-- (A) by striking ``shall'' the first place it appears and inserting ``may''; and (B) by striking ``, and unless excused by the chief judge, shall remain throughout the conference''. (b) In the interest of saving taxpayer dollars and reducing the cost of Government, it is the sense of the Senate that the chief judges of the various United States circuit courts should use new communications technologies to conduct judicial conferences. (c) This section shall apply only to contracts entered into after the date of enactment of this Act. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment, on behalf of myself and Senator Kyl, that would stop a wasteful Government practice that has received a lot of press attention lately and has drawn sharp criticism from watchdog groups like the National Taxpayers Union. Mr. President, the practice I am talking about is taxpayer-funded travel by Federal judges to so-called judicial conferences. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, I am concerned about the budgetary propriety of continuing current practice with regard to judicial conferences in this new era of balanced budgets and streamlined Government. Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that two newspaper articles be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. The first article is entitled ``Taxpayers Foot the Bill for Judges to Meet at Resort'' and the second is entitled ``Times Are Tight, But Circuit Isn't.'' The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See exhibits 1 and 2.) Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I commend these revealing articles to my colleagues. In the first article, U.S. District Court judge, William Nickerson, is quoted as saying, ``As a taxpayer, I would probably complain,'' when asked about a judicial conference hosted at the five-star Greenbrier resort in West Virginia. The second article recounts that a Federal judge and former Congressman introduced a resolution to reduce the cost of judicial conferences in the ninth circuit by having them less frequently. Sadly, this responsible and wise proposal was defeated by a vote of 5 to 3. This amendment removes the requirement that conferences be held, giving Federal courts the flexibility to schedule conferences or, if they decide not to schedule them, just to not have a conference. In brief, Mr. President, the amendment will limit the location of judicial conferences to the geographic boundaries of the circuit to minimize travel costs which obviously come when there is travel outside of the circuit. It would also amend Federal law so that judicial conferences are no longer mandatory, and express the sense of the Senate that the Federal Judiciary should explore the idea of using new communications technology--teleconferencing, et cetera--to conduct conferences without travel. I believe the amendment will save money and give new and needed flexibility to the Federal courts. As I said, Federal judges from around the country are currently compelled by law to attend a conference with other judges at least once every 2 years. So, I cannot fault anyone with scheduling these conferences or attending them since the law requires it. But I can--and do--find fault with those who choose only the most luxurious hotels and resorts. I can--and do--find fault with some of the activities at these publicly funded conferences. According to some press reports, less than a third of the time judges spend at these conferences relates to judicial work. In one case, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper, during one 3-day conference at Hilton Head, SC, only 10 hours were set aside for work. The rest of the time was left open so that the attendees could socialize, visit with each other, or do whatever. Importantly, Federal courts are continuing these expensive conferences at the same time judicial resources are scarce and funds for representing poorer Americans are drying up. I respectfully submit that these are not sound priorities. The amendment that I and Senator Kyl offer today does what even some judges want to do. It would limit the location of judicial conferences to major urban areas--I want to emphasize this--within the circuit court of appeals, not outside. A few circuits, where judges are dissatisfied with the resorts within their circuit boundaries, have been going halfway across the country to attend a judicial conference-- at taxpayer expense. I am not the first to note the extravagance and unnecessary expense associated with these conferences. Fair-minded judges have been complaining about these conferences themselves for years. To name just a few, Circuit Judge Charles Wiggins, of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and U.S. District Court Judge Frederic Smalkin have both complained that these conferences are unjustifiably expensive. A few years ago, a district court judge in Kansas City, like Judge Wiggins in the ninth circuit, was so outraged by the posh, remote resorts where these conferences are hosted that he introduced a resolution to limit the location of conferences. Yet another judge has referred to judicial conferences as a sort of ``camp.'' And U.S. District Court Judge Carl Rubin was quoted by the Cleveland Plain Dealer as saying ``there are a lot of things I'd rather see the taxpayers' money spent on than sending me to Hilton Head for 3 days.'' According to that same article, Pete Seep of the National Taxpayers' Union states his opinion that ``Federal taxpayers are paying judges to party.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters written to me by Federal judges--one from Michigan and one from Texas--urging me to trim the excesses associated with judicial conferences be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. Bankruptcy court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Flint, MI, July 6, 1995. Re Travel/Chambers savings. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Chairman, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, Washington, DC. Dear Senator Grassley: I read in a recent article in the Wall Street Journal how you were trying to effectuate needed savings in the budget for the federal judiciary. As a member of the lowest rung on the ladder of the federal judiciary, I offer two suggestions for savings within the judicial branch. I have been a bankruptcy judge for 11 years. As you know, federal judges are required by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 333 to attend a judicial conference each year. The first year I attended such a conference, it occurred to me that there was a place where some savings could be effected. In my experience, the judicial conferences are arranged so that the judges travel usually on a Tuesday and return home on a Friday or Saturday. As you are well aware, commercial airlines give tremendous discounts for early booking with a Saturday night stayover. The thought came [[Page S 14649]] to mind long ago that if judges were required to attend the conference over a Saturday night, it could save a lot of money. This concept holds true for Federal Judicial Center functions as well. My suggestion was met with the response that judges prefer to be home with their families on the weekends. While that is obviously true (when I suggested this, I had two small children at home, ages eight and five), I did not think it was too much to ask high government officials to give up a weekend once in a while, especially since such a large savings would be created. Now that funding is much tighter, I repeat this suggestion. Another suggestion deals with the cost of furnishing chambers. Due to expansion in the district court, I was asked to move my courtrooms and chambers out of the federal buildings in Flint and Bay City. In the process, I was given a budget for furnishing chambers (which included my personal office, my secretary's office and reception area, my law clerk's office, the library, the media room, two attorney conference rooms, and the courtroom waiting area) for $25,000 total. We just about made it for that amount. I do not know for sure, but I have been told that other judges are allowed roughly $50,000 for furnishing a much smaller chambers' unit. Perhaps some uniformity would save some money. While I am in accord with the statements of the federal judge quoted in the Journal article with respect to there being a need for decorum and dignity in a federal courthouse, I also concur in your efforts and those of Senator Baucus to provide that at a lower cost. By effectuating some reasonable savings in non-essential areas, Congress ought to be able to reinstitute cost of living increases for the judiciary. Without such regular adjustments, of course, Congress is condemning the judiciary to consistent decreases in take-home pay. Sincerely, Arthur J. Spector, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge. ____ U.S. District Court, Western District of Texas, San Antonio, TX, June 6, 1995. Hon. Charles E. Grassley, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC Dear Senator Grassley: At a recent conference of the Fifth Judicial Circuit, we were advised of your efforts to address government expenditures for judicial meetings and conferences. I applaud and encourage such efforts. All branches of government must search for and find ways of reducing government expense. This area can be modified, relatively painlessly, with no loss in the quality of judicial services provided. Title 28 U.S.C. Section 333 allows an annual circuit conferences and requires that one be held in each circuit no more than every two years. Attendances for judges summoned is mandatory. Perhaps Section 333 could be amended to reduce the number of circuit conferences and/or permit participation to be optional. Once per year, we also hold separate workshops for circuit judges, district judges, magistrate judges, and bankruptcy judges. These instructional meetings address various substantive topics and can be beneficial. However, the information can be provided to us in written form at our offices to avoid the cost of travel, housing, meals, and lectures. I am sure many more ways of reducing expenses for judicial meetings exist. These meetings can be valuable but are not absolutely necessary to the administration of justice. Particularly in these economic times, their cost is difficult to justify. I wanted you to know that judges will support, and even participate in, efforts to reduce the amount of money allocated to the judiciary's budget. Sincerly, John W. Primomo, U.S. Magistrate Judge. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I believe that the costs of conferences are underestimated. These estimates--which range as high as one-half million dollars per conference--do not take into account lost time on the bench for judges and their support staff, who also attend the conferences at taxpayer expense. And the taxpayers foot these expenses year after year. The party's over, Mr. President. There is a word for this sort of thing: Boondoggle. I have fought against wasting taxpayer money my whole career in the Senate, and I am committed to fighting unnecessary spending in the judiciary. Mr. President, under current law, Federal judges are required to host and attend these conferences. This amendment will change that so that judges have the flexibility not to call a judicial conference. This amendment would also give individual Federal judges the option of not attending a conference. This is fair, and permits Federal courts--which I believe will act responsibly in light of the Federal Government's budgetary constraints--to pitch in and tighten belts along with us in Congress and the executive branch. As I have said, Mr. President, this amendment is about saving taxpayer dollars and priorities. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Finally, I just want to say that this amendment should not be viewed as a general indictment of the Federal judiciary. For the most part, I think that the judiciary has taken responsible and important steps to reduce unnecessary spending. This amendment is simply targeted to a use of Federal funds that, in the opinion of this Senator, should be pruned. Thank you, Mr. President. Exhibit 1 [From the Baltimore Sun, June 30, 1994] Taxpayers Foot the Bill for Judges to Meet at Resort (by Marcia Myers) As the federal judiciary struggles amid hiring freezes and funding shortages for basic services, 150 judges from Maryland and other parts of the Fourth Circuit converged yesterday on the broad verandas, lush fairways and tennis courts of the five-star Greebrier resort. Their taxpayer-financed gathering will demand little work in the afternoons and barely any at night--unless you count one banquet and a sing-along led by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. Of course, several hundred lawyers pay their own way, and those who consider schmoozing part of the job might argue that they're working tirelessly. The cost to taxpayers for the four-day conference: about $200,000. Even some who appreciate the Greenbrier's pampering question the propriety of the trip to the mountains of White Sulphur Springs, W.Va. ``As a taxpayer, I would probably complain,'' U.S. District Judge William M. Nickerson said, while adding that the meeting offers a good opportunity to talk informally with other judges. ``I think a lot of the judges have some concerns as taxpayers. Some feel it's more of a luxury than it needs to be.'' Others are more direct in criticizing the annual conference, for which taxpayers will pay up to $1,000 per judge plus travel expenses. ``I don't think the expense is justified on an annual basis,'' said U.S. District Judge Frederic N. Smalkin. Consider the schedule for the conference, which includes district, magistrate and bankruptcy judges from Maryland, North and South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia: Day 1: Judges arrive--no activities are planned. Day 2: Judges attend a morning session for about 3 hours to discuss court business. No other activities are planned until the Rehnquist sing-along that evening. Day 3: A trio of one-hour lectures on ethics is scheduled. At noon, the six new judges in the circuit offer brief remarks. Nothing else is planned until an evening reception and banquet. Day 4: The morning features a panel discussion reviewing major Supreme Court decisions of the 1993 term. That ends the conference, although judges on committees may attend additional meetings. Meanwhile, conferees are encouraged to sign up for group activities that include tennis, golf, bridge and hiking. Among the resort's other amenities: three 18-hole championship golf courses, fly fishing, skeet shooting, horseback riding, swimming, and the Greenbrier Spa, Mineral Baths & Salon. ``Personally, I think it's of real value,'' Senior U.S. District Judge John R. Hargrove said of the conference. ``Do we have to cut our own throats just because Congress won't give us more money? We still have to have training. We don't go down there and sit around.'' Why not have a shorter meeting, strictly business, at a less luxurious spot? ``We tried that at least once in the 20 years since I came here,'' said the circuit's Chief Judge, Sam J. Ervin III of North Carolina. ``The afternoon sessions were not very productive--nobody much came. ``I think the most important thing about this conference is that lawyers have an opportunity to mingle with the judges and share their problems and difficulties.'' That talk could include concerns over the shrinking resources of the federal courts. Amid a hiring freeze in Maryland and across the nation, the courts are at 84 percent of adequate staffing levels--the lowest ever, according to a court official. And the situation could get worse. Court officials worry about funds for court security, courtroom deputies and computers. Business that used to be done in a day in Baltimore, for example, now can take several days because of staffing shortages. When asked how much the conference would cost taxpayers, Circuit Executive Samuel W. Phillips said about $55,000. But after acknowledging the $1,000 allowance for each judge, plus travel and administrative expenses, he estimated the cost at $175,000 to $200,000. Mr. Phillips said he had checked many other hotels for a better rate. But the Greenbrier includes two meals in its room rate, which makes it cheaper, he said. A typical room for two costs $434 a night, although the judges receive a discount that he wouldn't disclose. It's also one of the few hotels capable of accommodating everybody--judges, spouses and lawyers--under one roof, he said. The government pays for judges' hotel rooms and meals. The cost of recreation--at [[Page S 14650]] the Greenbrier, golf fees are $80 and tennis courts are $23 an hour-- comes from each judge's own pocket. The conference alternates every other year between the Greenbrier and the Homestead, a similar resort in Hot Springs, Va. The judges are quick to note that attendance is required-- by law. Congress passed a bill in the 1930s requiring judges in each circuit to gather annually to consider court business. As budget concerns have mounted in recent years, the law was amended to require a meeting only once every two years. Several circuits have cut back to biennial meetings, but Judge Ervin said the Fourth Circuit had rejected that idea. [From the Recorder, September 29, 1993] Times Are Tights, But Circuit Isn't (By Steve Albert) Soon after money problems forced postponement of pay raises for judicial employees and led federal judges to suspend civil jury trials, the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals spent about $600,000 to send 350 judges and lawyers to a four-day conference at a luxury Santa Barbara beach resort. While other circuits reacted to tight budgets this year by canceling their retreats or deciding to hold them every other year, the Ninth Circuit opted to go forward with its August 1993 conference and continue holding its retreat annually. Circuit chief Judge J. Clifford Wallace called the conference expenditures ``money well spent.'' Congress mandates that circuits hold conferences, Wallace said, and the retreats provide the only opportunity ``to bring together people who have responsibility to improve the administration of justice.'' Circuit and district judges, magistrates, bankruptcy judges, U.S. attorneys, federal public defenders and court clerks from nine Western states attend the conference. In addition, the circuit's 27 active judges get together six times a year, hold an annual winter symposium, and meet with different judges once every year or two for continuing education. Estimates of government expenses for the Santa Barbara conference were released last week shortly before the U.S. House of Representatives appropriated $2.8 billion for the judiciary for fiscal 1994, a 10 percent increase over this year. A House/Senate conference committee is expected to settle on the final number this week or next. The Senate wants to give this judiciary just a 5 percent increase for the new fiscal year, which begins Friday. The cost estimate of the Ninth Circuit conference, prepared by circuit executives at The Recorder's request, shows that 300 judges, prosecutors, public defenders and clerks traveled to Santa Barbara by air at an average cost of $550 each. Another 50 traveled by car from Los Angeles at an average cost of $50. The attendees spent an average of $250 for room and food each day of the four-day conference and an average of $34 on check-out day. Add in about $27,000 for such items as speakers' travel, printing and audiovisual material, and the total bill for taxpayers was about $556,000. Because judges submit individual expense vouchers, that figure is an estimate only. The figure does not include the cost of travel during the rest of the year for the 12 judges who meet four times annually to help plan the conference. About 100 other attendees, mostly lawyers in private practice, paid their own way. $100 million bailout The conference came just eight months after the U.S. Judicial Conference--the governing body of the federal courts--imposed a hiring freeze and postponed some pay increases for federal court employees in the Ninth Circuit and around the country. At the same time, the Judicial Conference's executive committee trimmed court operating expenses as well as probation and pretrial services funding, citing a $100 million operating shortfall. In June, citing a lack of funds to pay jurors, federal trial courts around the country briefly suspended some civil jury trials, Congress passed a $100 million bailout for the courts in early July. The budget shortfall prompted Wallace in May to propose that many indigents who need court-appointed lawyers be asked to repay the government for the cost of their defense, much as students are required to pay off student loans for college tuition. The savings, he theorized, could be used to avoid funding shortfalls. But Wallace said Monday that despite budgetary problems, the conference remained an essential expense. He cited the circuit's recently released study of gender bias in the courts and its decision to study bias based on race, religion and ethnicity as examples of the work the conference takes on. ``No one can doubt the importance of those issues,'' Wallace said. ``It would be difficult to cut the conference because of budget difficulty.'' Other circuits around the country have cancelled their annual conferences, however. The New York-based Second Circuit and Denver-based Tenth Circuit cancelled their 1993 meetings, and the St. Louis-based Eighth Circuit has cancelled its 1994 conference. Four other circuits have gone to biennial conferences. A call to cancel future Ninth Circuit conferences was defeated by a 5-3 vote of the circuit's executive committee at its August meeting in Santa Barbara. Circuit Judge Charles Wiggins, a former Republican congressman, warned colleagues then that the cost could engender the wrong ``public perception,'' especially in tight budget times. Executive committee members voted to go ahead with the circuit's 1994 conference in San Diego and its 1995 conference in Hawaii. Exactly how much the Ninth Circuit or other circuits spend on annual conferences is difficult to pinpoint, according to circuit executives and a spokesman for the U.S. Administrative Office of the Courts, which disburses money to the federal bench. Judges submit conference expense vouchers and reimbursement checks are issued in Washington. The Ninth Circuit cost estimates were based on average airfare costs calculated by circuit executives and the $250 maximum per day charge judges and other government employees are allowed for lodging and food. Circuit conference expenses are subtracted from the ``Salaries and Expenses'' line of the courts' budget. Individual circuit expenses are never set forth in judicial budget requests, said David Sellers, a spokesman for the administrative office of the courts. ``It doesn't get much more specific than that,'' Sellers said. New Jersey District Chief Judge John Gerry, who chairs the Judicial Conference's executive committee, said the Ninth Circuit's conference cost estimate was the first such estimate he had ever heard. The executive committee, which holds the Judicial Conference's purse strings, does not take up or examine individual circuit expenditures, he said. But the conference a year ago asked circuits to evaluate the necessity of retreats and their costs. ``There hasn't been any area of court operations we have not looked at to save a buck here and there,'' Gerry said. His own circuit, the Third, has gone to biennial conferences. a model circuit Wallace said the work of the Ninth Circuit conference has been recognized by other circuits. ``Some of us do a better job than others in our efforts to improve the system,'' Wallace said. If efforts were not made to improve the administration of justice, he added, costs of administering the courts could be higher than they already are. ``The budgeting problem is very complicated,'' Wallace said. ``By singling out one aspect, the overall picture can be blurred. We have thrashed this out. We have been responsible.'' But some circuit judges like Wiggins have complained that the conference is not as productive as Wallace or others may think. ``We don't talk about much of interest to any of us; our discussions are so broad,'' Wiggins told his colleagues in Santa Barbara. At the Santa Barbara meeting, conferees discussed cooperation with the executive and legislative branches and, in addition to passing a resolution calling for a task force to study bias, passed one supporting adequate funding for the courts. Savings in conference costs would not have offset lack of funds for jury trials or public defender programs because those costs come out of different budget lines than the line used to pay for conferences, said Wallace and court spokesman Sellers. This year's conference schedule, like those in the past, included such diversions as tennis and golf tournaments, a spouse sightseeing and winery tour and cooking and flower arranging classes. Wallace confirmed that the Ninth Circuit conference next August will be held at the Loews Coronado Bay Resort on the beach south of San Diego. The resorts offers bayside suites and has three heated pools and a marina.

', 'Mr. KOHL.', ' Mr. ', 'President, I ', 'will call for a rollcall vote, but I want to answer briefly what the Senator said. ', 'The FBI ', 'this coming year is funded at a 15-percent increase over last year. There is not a single request the FBI has made for funding that we have not authorized and are prepared to fund, without--without--this $80 million. This $80 million is over and above everything that the FBI has authorized, the President has requested and the House has funded. He talks about midnight basketball league, and that is a synonym for money that we think is wasted on prevention. As Senator Cohen pointed out, this money is block granted to States. They do not have to spend it on midnight basketball. We have decided that much of the money we are spending at the Federal level the States can spend much more effectively. You have made that argument time and time again. Let the Governors, let the local government spend the money, not Washington. That is what these crime prevention programs are aimed at. These crime prevention programs, if the Governors so wish, could be spent on programs like ', 'DARE.', ' Everyone in this Chamber understands and recognizes that ', 'DARE ', 'is a program that works. So midnight basketball is not where these funds are going to be expended. They are going to be given to States and Governors and local governments to spend as they see fit. Again, the argument is that in any crimefighting bill, a certain amount of money, modest as it is, needs to be spent on trying to prevent it from occurring in the first place, and I do not think that there are any Senators, or many Senators in this Chamber who would not agree with this principle. And that is all this amendment intends to do. Several Senators addressed the Chair. ', 'The PRESIDING ', 'OFFICER.', ' The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas. ', 'Mr. GRAMM.', ' Mr. President, $80 million will be spent here by this amendment, our distinguished colleague talks about letting the States spend it, but we are not taking it away from Federal midnight basketball, we are not taking it away from Federal prevention programs.

', 'All I ', 'have tried to do in this bill is to provide part of that funding. What we would be doing here is cutting the FBI to fund programs that may or may not do anything to prevent crime. The intentions of the program may be good. There are people who are strong proponents, for example, of midnight basketball. The point is, do we want to cut the FBI to fund it? I say no. I think this amendment should be rejected and it should be rejected soundly. ', 'Mr. BIDEN ', 'addressed the Chair. ', 'The PRESIDING ', 'OFFICER.', ' The Senator from Delaware. ', 'Mr. BIDEN.', ' Mr. ', 'President, I ', 'will be very brief. First of all, this is not about midnight basketball. That is a great thing to talk about. The States are not using this for midnight basketball. Let me tell you what they are using it for, to give you one example. I can pick almost any one of your States. The thing States use this money for, for example, is boys clubs and girls clubs. Let me tell you about boys clubs and girls clubs. There is a study the Judiciary Committee did and it has been done by others, and no one disputes it. If you put in a boys club and girls club--the study was done in Chicago and New York--you take two housing projects, the same type of housing projects, and put a boys club and girls club in the basement of one and no boys club and girls club in the basement of the other, the difference in the rate of crime is as follows: 31 percent fewer arrests in the project that has a boys club and girls club in it; 27 [[', 'Page S ', ""14646]] percent less use of drugs, arrest for drugs; and 19 percent fewer arrests for any acts of violence. As my dear old mother would say, an idle mind is a devil's workshop. You put these kids out there, and you have nothing for them. Let me tell you what these boys and girls clubs do with the money we have in here. One example: There is not a single one of these clubs that has midnight basketball. I will tell you what they have. They have the following deal: If you join the club and you are involved--and particularly, they put them in housing projects, which they are now doing in most of your States, putting in public housing projects. What they are required to do is to have computer classes before they can play in the gym. Second, they are required in a State like mine, and many of yours, to have mentoring programs. They bring the mentoring programs into the schools. Of the people who volunteer in the boys and girls clubs, 80 percent are uniformed police officers. Third, what they do is they get these kids into these programs, and part of the requirement to stay in the program and to be able to use the boys and girls club is you have to stay in school and have passing grades. What they have done is changed the culture in those communities. I will give you one example by limiting it to boys and girls clubs. YMCAs and church groups are all involved in these programs. We are not talking about midnight basketball. Second, we are talking about the weed and seed program, which started under President "", 'Bush. I ', 'can pick 50 quotes. I will pick one from a ', 'Republican U.', 'S. Attorney from Georgia, Joe Whitley, former U.S. Attorney from the northern district of ', 'Georgia: I ', ""have said that this is the most important matter I have ever dealt with as U.S. Attorney. It's a simple but fundamentally sound idea that people in communities really seem to believe. . . . The program is responsive to the concerns of citizens. It's positive because residents thought it had real and credibility--combining law enforcement and prevention. I can talk about Michael Chertoff, former U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, a Republican, and Debra Daniels, former U.S. Attorney, southern district of Indiana, a Republican. The list goes on. Crime prevention is an issue that has been the subject of more misinformation and outright mischaracterization than perhaps any other in the crime debate-- Whether we should work to prevent crime before it happens, instead of waiting until after the shots are fired, until after our children become addicted to drugs, until after more Americans' lives are ruined. The anticrime law enacted last year answered that question unapologetically. In addition to fighting crime--the law made a commitment to preventing crime. A commitment supported by virtually every criminologist, every legal scholar, every sociologist, every psychologist, every medical authority, and nearly everyone's common sense. Those who study this issue agree that breaking the cycle of violence and crime requires an investment in the lives of our children-- With support and guidance to help them reject the violence and anarchy of the streets in favor of taking positive responsibility for their lives. In fact, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National District Attorneys Association, and the International Brotherhood of Police Officers cite prevention programs as critical to a long-term cure for crime. Prevention is what cops want--what virtually everyone in law enforcement wants. Every police officer I have talked to, every prosecutor, every prison warden, every probation officer says the same thing--we can't do it alone. And listen to local officials--the very people the Republicans say they want to give greater voice. Republican Mayors Giuliani of New York and Riordan of Los Angeles say this: By funding proven prevention programs for young people, the crime bill offers hope--hope that in the future we can reduce the need for so many police officers and jails. Listen to Paul Helmke, the Republican mayor of Fort "", 'Wayne, IN:', "" It's a lot less expensive to do things on the prevention side than on the police side. And prevention of crime--particularly juvenile crime--is more important now than ever before. Last week the Department of Justice released its first national report on juvenile offenders and victims. The report found that between 1988 and 1992 the juvenile violent crime arrest rate has increased by more than 50 percent. It further estimated that even if the crime rate ceases to grow in future years, juvenile population growth alone would produce a 22 percent rise in violent crime arrests. Should the violent rate continue to grow as it has between 1988 and 1992, the number of juveniles arrested for violent crimes will double by the year 2010--to more than 260,000 arrests! Attorney General Janet Reno specifically cited prevention and intervention programs as one of the fundamental ways to combat this type of growth in juvenile crime. Prisons, though essential, are a testament to failure: They are the right place for people gone wrong. On the other hand, when a life about to go wrong is set back on the right track--that is a testament to hope. We build hope by showing children that they matter, by challenging disaffection with affection and respect, and by contrasting the dead- end of violence with the opportunity for a constructive life-- I would now like to briefly comment on the three programs in this amendment. local crime prevention block grants Local crime prevention block grants were created to allow cities and towns to develop their own prevention programs to combat child abuse, youth gangs, drug abuse by children, and crimes against the elderly-- including the D.A.R.E. Program and the boys and girls clubs. Local crime prevention grants enable communities to institute successful initiatives such as: Measures to prevent juvenile violence, juvenile gangs, and the use and sale of illegal drugs by juveniles, programs to prevent crimes against the elderly, midnight sports league programs to keep kids off the street and away from drugs, supervised sports and recreation programs after school and on holidays, the establishment of Boys and Girls Clubs of America in public housing facilities, and the creation of special crime units to deal with crimes in which a child is involved, to name a few. These prevention strategies and programs have proven effective in reducing the incidence of crime in both the short and long term. Here are some examples of programs that have proven track records: In hundreds of public housing projects across the country, boys and girls clubs give kids a safe place to hang out after school--a place with positive activities and positive role models. A recent, independent evaluation has reported that housing projects with clubs experience 13 percent fewer juvenile crimes, 22 percent less drug activity, and 25 percent less crack use, than do projects with clubs. In Honolulu, professionals identify families at risk for neglect or abuse when children are born and then visit their homes regularly over several years to help parents learn to care for their children. In Houston, Texas, a core of professionals provides one-on-one counseling, mentoring, tutoring, job training and crisis-intervention services to students at risk for dropping out. And in Delaware, ``Stormin' Normin'' Oliver runs an award-winning summer basketball league--in which team members must participate in supervised study sessions and perform community-service work in addition to their time on the courts. Although many communities are putting their best foot forward, the need and demand for prevention programs far outpace the supply. And yet the republicans have targeted prevention grants in the crime law for complete elimination--a move some charge is cold-hearted and mean. "", 'But I ', 'say it is just plain dumb. Local crime prevention block grants are one of the best means we have to ensure States and localities have the funding they need to reduce crime over the long haul. Weed and seed is a republican, Bush administration program, the brainchild of former Attorney General William Barr. The program funds prevention efforts and comprehensive law enforcement efforts. [[', 'Page S ', ""14647]] The weed and seed program has achieved notable success primarily because it requires the kind of community policing that works, and then requires that law enforcement, social service agencies, the private sector, and the community work together to prevent crime. So this is a program that works because it utilizes both law enforcement and community participation. In a number of cities--such as Madison, Houston, Trenton, and Camden--notable reductions in crime have been achieved in weed and seed areas. Many of weed and seed's biggest fans are former "", 'Republican U.', 'S. attorneys. Let me tell you what a few of them have said: Joe Whitley, former U.S. attorney from the northern district of ', 'Georgia: I ', ""have said that this is the most important matter I have ever dealt with as U.S. attorney. It's a simple but fundamentally sound idea that people in communities really seemed to believe. * * * The program is responsive to the concerns of citizens. It's positive because residents thought it had real credibility--combining law enforcement and prevention. Michael Chertoff, former U.S. attorney for New Jersey: Trenton was a pilot city. It was a very successful project and I think very highly of it. * * * Community policing worked very well in closing the distance between the police and the community, and it deterred crime because it gave the police a better reputation within the community. Debra Daniels, former U.S. attorney from the southern district of Indiana: In a nutshell, it is the kind of program that you want. ``Program'' is the wrong word because it connotes money only--you want to emphasize the aspect of weed and seed that has to do with planning at the grassroots level. Weed and seed requires collaboration of all governmental agencies working closely at all levels with people in neighborhoods to create a complete package of crime fighting, policing, human services and economic development. * * * The community leadership development was miraculous and the crime rate decreased. The consensus of all the law enforcement experts around the country is that youth gangs are a serious problem and a growing problem. The most recent report on juvenile offenders from the office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention at the department of justice reports that the number of jurisdictions affected by youth gangs has increased substantially in the last 20 years and that gang- related crime has increased since the late 1980s. Yet very little is done to directly target youth gangs. This amendment would boost funds for the two Department of Justice programs that specifically target this problem. One of these is the gang free schools and communities program, which funds counseling, education, and crisis intervention through coordinated social service, substance abuse treatment and other means. The other is the community based gang intervention program, which: (1) develops regional task forces of state, local and community organizations to fight gangs; (2) encourages cooperation among local education, juvenile justice, employment, and social service agencies and community based organizations; and (3) funds programs offering effective punishment options, including restitution, community service, home detention, and boot camps. So this amendment provides an absolutely critical prevention element to our overall anti-crime efforts. The 1994 crime law provided over $300 million of authorized funding for prevention programs for the next year but the Republican appropriations bill eliminated virtually all of it. Offset: this amendment would restore $80 million--one quarter of the lost prevention funds--to fund these three programs. The money is taken from a portion of new FBI salaries and expenses that were increased above the president's request. I urge my colleagues to support this vital amendment. I will conclude by saying that I have great respect for the abilities of my friend from Texas. But this is about weed and seed and other good programs, not about midnight basketball. "", 'Whenever I ', ""debate him on issues relating to guns, he pulls out his mama's gun and says, ``You ain't going to take my mama's gun from her.'' I am not after his mama's gun or midnight basketball. This works. I challenge anybody in this Chamber to go home and ask 10 police chiefs in your State--10--and I am prepared to bet you that 9 of those 10 will tell you that they desperately need these local prevention programs. The reason they got put in the bill in the first place is because of the cops. Not a single social worker came to me and said: You have to put in prevention when this bill is written.

(c) This section shall apply only to contracts entered into after the date of enactment of this Act. "", 'Mr. GRASSLEY.', ' Mr. ', 'President, I ', 'rise today to introduce an amendment, on behalf of myself and Senator Kyl, that would stop a wasteful Government practice that has received a lot of press attention lately and has drawn sharp criticism from watchdog groups like the National Taxpayers Union. Mr. President, the practice I am talking about is taxpayer-funded travel by Federal judges to so-called judicial conferences. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the ', 'Courts, I ', ""am concerned about the budgetary propriety of continuing current practice with regard to judicial conferences in this new era of balanced budgets and streamlined Government. Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that two newspaper articles be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. The first article is entitled ``Taxpayers Foot the Bill for Judges to Meet at Resort'' and the second is entitled ``Times Are Tight, But Circuit Isn't.'' "", 'The PRESIDING ', 'OFFICER.', ' Without objection, it is so ordered. (See exhibits 1 and 2.) ', 'Mr. GRASSLEY.', ' Mr. ', 'President, I ', ""commend these revealing articles to my colleagues. In the first article, U.S. District Court judge, William Nickerson, is quoted as saying, ``As a taxpayer, I would probably complain,'' when asked about a judicial conference hosted at the five-star Greenbrier resort in West Virginia. The second article recounts that a Federal judge and former Congressman introduced a resolution to reduce the cost of judicial conferences in the ninth circuit by having them less frequently. Sadly, this responsible and wise proposal was defeated by a vote of 5 to 3. This amendment removes the requirement that conferences be held, giving Federal courts the flexibility to schedule conferences or, if they decide not to schedule them, just to not have a conference. In brief, Mr. President, the amendment will limit the location of judicial conferences to the geographic boundaries of the circuit to minimize travel costs which obviously come when there is travel outside of the circuit. It would also amend Federal law so that judicial conferences are no longer mandatory, and express the sense of the Senate that the Federal Judiciary should explore the idea of using new communications technology--teleconferencing, et cetera--to conduct conferences without travel. I believe the amendment will save money and give new and needed flexibility to the Federal courts. "", 'As I ', 'said, Federal judges from around the country are currently compelled by law to attend a conference with other judges at least once every 2 years. ', 'So, I ', 'cannot fault anyone with scheduling these conferences or attending them since the law requires it. ', 'But I ', 'can--and do--find fault with those who choose only the most luxurious hotels and resorts. I can--and do--find fault with some of the activities at these publicly funded conferences. According to some press reports, less than a third of the time judges spend at these conferences relates to judicial work. In one case, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper, during one 3-day conference at Hilton ', 'Head, SC,', "" only 10 hours were set aside for work. The rest of the time was left open so that the attendees could socialize, visit with each other, or do whatever. Importantly, Federal courts are continuing these expensive conferences at the same time judicial resources are scarce and funds for representing poorer Americans are drying up. I respectfully submit that these are not sound priorities. The amendment that I and Senator Kyl offer today does what even some judges want to do. It would limit the location of judicial conferences to major urban areas--I want to emphasize this--within the circuit court of appeals, not outside. A few circuits, where judges are dissatisfied with the resorts within their circuit boundaries, have been going halfway across the country to attend a judicial conference-- at taxpayer expense. I am not the first to note the extravagance and unnecessary expense associated with these conferences. Fair-minded judges have been complaining about these conferences themselves for years. To name just a few, Circuit Judge Charles Wiggins, of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and U.S. District Court Judge Frederic Smalkin have both complained that these conferences are unjustifiably expensive. A few years ago, a district court judge in Kansas City, like Judge Wiggins in the ninth circuit, was so outraged by the posh, remote resorts where these conferences are hosted that he introduced a resolution to limit the location of conferences. Yet another judge has referred to judicial conferences as a sort of ``camp.'' "", 'And U.', ""S. District Court Judge Carl Rubin was quoted by the Cleveland Plain Dealer as saying ``there are a lot of things I'd rather see the taxpayers' money spent on than sending me to Hilton Head for 3 days.'' According to that same article, Pete Seep of the National Taxpayers' Union states his opinion that ``Federal taxpayers are paying judges to party.'' Mr. "", 'President, I ', 'ask unanimous consent that two letters written to me by Federal judges--one from Michigan and one from Texas--urging me to trim the excesses associated with judicial conferences be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. Bankruptcy court for the Eastern District of Michigan, ', 'Flint, MI,', ' July 6, 1995. Re Travel/Chambers savings. Senator ', 'Charles E.', ' Grassley, Chairman, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, ', 'Washington, DC.', ' Dear Senator ', 'Grassley: I ', 'read in a recent article in the Wall Street Journal how you were trying to effectuate needed savings in the budget for the federal judiciary. As a member of the lowest rung on the ladder of the federal judiciary, I offer two suggestions for savings within the judicial branch. I have been a bankruptcy judge for 11 years. As you know, federal judges are required by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 333 to attend a judicial conference each year. The first year I attended such a conference, it occurred to me that there was a place where some savings could be effected. In my experience, the judicial conferences are arranged so that the judges travel usually on a Tuesday and return home on a Friday or Saturday. As you are well aware, commercial airlines give tremendous discounts for early booking with a Saturday night stayover. The thought came [[', 'Page S ', ""14649]] to mind long ago that if judges were required to attend the conference over a Saturday night, it could save a lot of money. This concept holds true for Federal Judicial Center functions as well. My suggestion was met with the response that judges prefer to be home with their families on the weekends. While that is obviously true (when I suggested this, I had two small children at home, ages eight and five), I did not think it was too much to ask high government officials to give up a weekend once in a while, especially since such a large savings would be created. Now that funding is much tighter, I repeat this suggestion. Another suggestion deals with the cost of furnishing chambers. Due to expansion in the district court, I was asked to move my courtrooms and chambers out of the federal buildings in Flint and Bay City. In the process, I was given a budget for furnishing chambers (which included my personal office, my secretary's office and reception area, my law clerk's office, the library, the media room, two attorney conference rooms, and the courtroom waiting area) for $25,000 total. We just about made it for that amount. I do not know for sure, but I have been told that other judges are allowed roughly $50,000 for furnishing a much smaller chambers' unit. Perhaps some uniformity would save some money. "", 'While I ', 'am in accord with the statements of the federal judge quoted in the Journal article with respect to there being a need for decorum and dignity in a federal courthouse, I also concur in your efforts and those of Senator Baucus to provide that at a lower cost. By effectuating some reasonable savings in non-essential areas, Congress ought to be able to reinstitute cost of living increases for the judiciary. Without such regular adjustments, of course, Congress is condemning the judiciary to consistent decreases in take-home pay. Sincerely, ', 'Arthur J.', ' ', 'Spector, U.', 'S. Bankruptcy Judge. ____ U.S. District Court, Western District of Texas, San ', 'Antonio, TX,', ' June 6, 1995. Hon. ', 'Charles E.', ' ', 'Grassley, U.', 'S. Senate, ', 'Washington, DC ', ""Dear Senator Grassley: At a recent conference of the Fifth Judicial Circuit, we were advised of your efforts to address government expenditures for judicial meetings and conferences. I applaud and encourage such efforts. All branches of government must search for and find ways of reducing government expense. This area can be modified, relatively painlessly, with no loss in the quality of judicial services provided. Title 28 U.S.C. Section 333 allows an annual circuit conferences and requires that one be held in each circuit no more than every two years. Attendances for judges summoned is mandatory. Perhaps Section 333 could be amended to reduce the number of circuit conferences and/or permit participation to be optional. Once per year, we also hold separate workshops for circuit judges, district judges, magistrate judges, and bankruptcy judges. These instructional meetings address various substantive topics and can be beneficial. However, the information can be provided to us in written form at our offices to avoid the cost of travel, housing, meals, and lectures. I am sure many more ways of reducing expenses for judicial meetings exist. These meetings can be valuable but are not absolutely necessary to the administration of justice. Particularly in these economic times, their cost is difficult to justify. I wanted you to know that judges will support, and even participate in, efforts to reduce the amount of money allocated to the judiciary's budget. Sincerly, "", 'John W.', ' ', 'Primomo, U.', 'S. Magistrate Judge. ', 'Mr. GRASSLEY.', ' Mr. ', 'President, I ', ""believe that the costs of conferences are underestimated. These estimates--which range as high as one-half million dollars per conference--do not take into account lost time on the bench for judges and their support staff, who also attend the conferences at taxpayer expense. And the taxpayers foot these expenses year after year. The party's over, Mr. President. There is a word for this sort of thing: "", 'Boondoggle. I ', ""have fought against wasting taxpayer money my whole career in the Senate, and I am committed to fighting unnecessary spending in the judiciary. Mr. President, under current law, Federal judges are required to host and attend these conferences. This amendment will change that so that judges have the flexibility not to call a judicial conference. This amendment would also give individual Federal judges the option of not attending a conference. This is fair, and permits Federal courts--which I believe will act responsibly in light of the Federal Government's budgetary constraints--to pitch in and tighten belts along with us in Congress and the executive branch. "", 'As I ', 'have said, Mr. President, this amendment is about saving taxpayer dollars and priorities. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. ', 'Finally, I ', 'just want to say that this amendment should not be viewed as a general indictment of the Federal judiciary. For the most part, I think that the judiciary has taken responsible and important steps to reduce unnecessary spending. This amendment is simply targeted to a use of Federal funds that, in the opinion of this Senator, should be pruned. Thank you, Mr. President. Exhibit 1 [From the Baltimore Sun, June 30, 1994] Taxpayers Foot the Bill for Judges to Meet at Resort (by Marcia Myers) As the federal judiciary struggles amid hiring freezes and funding shortages for basic services, 150 judges from Maryland and other parts of the Fourth Circuit converged yesterday on the broad verandas, lush fairways and tennis courts of the five-star Greebrier resort. Their taxpayer-financed gathering will demand little work in the afternoons and barely any at night--unless you count one banquet and a sing-along led by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice ', 'William H.', "" Rehnquist. Of course, several hundred lawyers pay their own way, and those who consider schmoozing part of the job might argue that they're working tirelessly. The cost to taxpayers for the four-day conference: about $200,000. Even some who appreciate the Greenbrier's pampering question the propriety of the trip to the mountains of White Sulphur "", 'Springs, W.', ""Va. ``As a taxpayer, I would probably complain,'' U.S. District Judge "", 'William M.', "" Nickerson said, while adding that the meeting offers a good opportunity to talk informally with other judges. ``I think a lot of the judges have some concerns as taxpayers. Some feel it's more of a luxury than it needs to be.'' Others are more direct in criticizing the annual conference, for which taxpayers will pay up to $1,000 per judge plus travel expenses. ``I don't think the expense is justified on an annual basis,'' said U.S. District Judge "", 'Frederic N.', "" Smalkin. Consider the schedule for the conference, which includes district, magistrate and bankruptcy judges from Maryland, North and South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia: Day 1: Judges arrive--no activities are planned. Day 2: Judges attend a morning session for about 3 hours to discuss court business. No other activities are planned until the Rehnquist sing-along that evening. Day 3: A trio of one-hour lectures on ethics is scheduled. At noon, the six new judges in the circuit offer brief remarks. Nothing else is planned until an evening reception and banquet. Day 4: The morning features a panel discussion reviewing major Supreme Court decisions of the 1993 term. That ends the conference, although judges on committees may attend additional meetings. Meanwhile, conferees are encouraged to sign up for group activities that include tennis, golf, bridge and hiking. Among the resort's other amenities: three 18-hole championship golf courses, fly fishing, skeet shooting, horseback riding, swimming, and the Greenbrier Spa, Mineral Baths & Salon. ``"", 'Personally, I ', ""think it's of real value,'' "", 'Senior U.', 'S. District Judge ', 'John R.', "" Hargrove said of the conference. ``Do we have to cut our own throats just because Congress won't give us more money? We still have to have training. We don't go down there and sit around.'' Why not have a shorter meeting, strictly business, at a less luxurious spot? ``We tried that at least once in the 20 years since I came here,'' said the circuit's Chief Judge, "", 'Sam J.', ' ', 'Ervin III ', ""of North Carolina. ``The afternoon sessions were not very productive--nobody much came. ``I think the most important thing about this conference is that lawyers have an opportunity to mingle with the judges and share their problems and difficulties.'' That talk could include concerns over the shrinking resources of the federal courts. Amid a hiring freeze in Maryland and across the nation, the courts are at 84 percent of adequate staffing levels--the lowest ever, according to a court official. And the situation could get worse. Court officials worry about funds for court security, courtroom deputies and computers. Business that used to be done in a day in Baltimore, for example, now can take several days because of staffing shortages. When asked how much the conference would cost taxpayers, Circuit Executive "", 'Samuel W.', "" Phillips said about $55,000. But after acknowledging the $1,000 allowance for each judge, plus travel and administrative expenses, he estimated the cost at $175,000 to $200,000. Mr. Phillips said he had checked many other hotels for a better rate. But the Greenbrier includes two meals in its room rate, which makes it cheaper, he said. A typical room for two costs $434 a night, although the judges receive a discount that he wouldn't disclose. It's also one of the few hotels capable of accommodating everybody--judges, spouses and lawyers--under one roof, he said. The government pays for judges' hotel rooms and meals. The cost of recreation--at [["", 'Page S ', ""14650]] the Greenbrier, golf fees are $80 and tennis courts are $23 an hour-- comes from each judge's own pocket. The conference alternates every other year between the Greenbrier and the Homestead, a similar resort in Hot Springs, Va. The judges are quick to note that attendance is required-- by law. Congress passed a bill in the 1930s requiring judges in each circuit to gather annually to consider court business. As budget concerns have mounted in recent years, the law was amended to require a meeting only once every two years. Several circuits have cut back to biennial meetings, but Judge Ervin said the Fourth Circuit had rejected that idea. [From the Recorder, September 29, 1993] Times Are Tights, But Circuit Isn't (By Steve Albert) Soon after money problems forced postponement of pay raises for judicial employees and led federal judges to suspend civil jury trials, the Ninth "", 'Circuit U.', 'S. Court of Appeals spent about $600,000 to send 350 judges and lawyers to a four-day conference at a luxury Santa Barbara beach resort. While other circuits reacted to tight budgets this year by canceling their retreats or deciding to hold them every other year, the Ninth Circuit opted to go forward with its August 1993 conference and continue holding its retreat annually. Circuit chief ', 'Judge J.', "" Clifford Wallace called the conference expenditures ``money well spent.'' Congress mandates that circuits hold conferences, Wallace said, and the retreats provide the only opportunity ``to bring together people who have responsibility to improve the administration of justice.'' Circuit and district judges, magistrates, bankruptcy judges, U.S. attorneys, federal public defenders and court clerks from nine Western states attend the conference. In addition, the circuit's 27 active judges get together six times a year, hold an annual winter symposium, and meet with different judges once every year or two for continuing education. Estimates of government expenses for the Santa Barbara conference were released last week shortly before the U.S. House of Representatives appropriated $2.8 billion for the judiciary for fiscal 1994, a 10 percent increase over this year. A House/Senate conference committee is expected to settle on the final number this week or next. The Senate wants to give this judiciary just a 5 percent increase for the new fiscal year, which begins Friday. The cost estimate of the Ninth Circuit conference, prepared by circuit executives at The Recorder's request, shows that 300 judges, prosecutors, public defenders and clerks traveled to Santa Barbara by air at an average cost of $550 each. Another 50 traveled by car from Los Angeles at an average cost of $50. The attendees spent an average of $250 for room and food each day of the four-day conference and an average of $34 on check-out day. Add in about $27,000 for such items as speakers' travel, printing and audiovisual material, and the total bill for taxpayers was about $556,000. Because judges submit individual expense vouchers, that figure is an estimate only. The figure does not include the cost of travel during the rest of the year for the 12 judges who meet four times annually to help plan the conference. About 100 other attendees, mostly lawyers in private practice, paid their own way. $100 million bailout The conference came just eight months after the U.S. Judicial Conference--the governing body of the federal courts--imposed a hiring freeze and postponed some pay increases for federal court employees in the Ninth Circuit and around the country. At the same time, the Judicial Conference's executive committee trimmed court operating expenses as well as probation and pretrial services funding, citing a $100 million operating shortfall. In June, citing a lack of funds to pay jurors, federal trial courts around the country briefly suspended some civil jury trials, Congress passed a $100 million bailout for the courts in early July. The budget shortfall prompted Wallace in May to propose that many indigents who need court-appointed lawyers be asked to repay the government for the cost of their defense, much as students are required to pay off student loans for college tuition. The savings, he theorized, could be used to avoid funding shortfalls. But Wallace said Monday that despite budgetary problems, the conference remained an essential expense. He cited the circuit's recently released study of gender bias in the courts and its decision to study bias based on race, religion and ethnicity as examples of the work the conference takes on. ``No one can doubt the importance of those issues,'' Wallace said. ``It would be difficult to cut the conference because of budget difficulty.'' Other circuits around the country have cancelled their annual conferences, however. The New York-based Second Circuit and Denver-based Tenth Circuit cancelled their 1993 meetings, and the St. Louis-based Eighth Circuit has cancelled its 1994 conference. Four other circuits have gone to biennial conferences. A call to cancel future Ninth Circuit conferences was defeated by a 5-3 vote of the circuit's executive committee at its August meeting in Santa Barbara. Circuit Judge Charles Wiggins, a former Republican congressman, warned colleagues then that the cost could engender the wrong ``public perception,'' especially in tight budget times. Executive committee members voted to go ahead with the circuit's 1994 conference in San Diego and its 1995 conference in Hawaii. Exactly how much the Ninth Circuit or other circuits spend on annual conferences is difficult to pinpoint, according to circuit executives and a spokesman for the U.S. Administrative Office of the Courts, which disburses money to the federal bench. Judges submit conference expense vouchers and reimbursement checks are issued in Washington. The Ninth Circuit cost estimates were based on average airfare costs calculated by circuit executives and the $250 maximum per day charge judges and other government employees are allowed for lodging and food. Circuit conference expenses are subtracted from the ``Salaries and Expenses'' line of the courts' budget. Individual circuit expenses are never set forth in judicial budget requests, said David Sellers, a spokesman for the administrative office of the courts. ``It doesn't get much more specific than that,'' Sellers said. New Jersey District Chief Judge John Gerry, who chairs the Judicial Conference's executive committee, said the Ninth Circuit's conference cost estimate was the first such estimate he had ever heard. The executive committee, which holds the Judicial Conference's purse strings, does not take up or examine individual circuit expenditures, he said. But the conference a year ago asked circuits to evaluate the necessity of retreats and their costs. ``There hasn't been any area of court operations we have not looked at to save a buck here and there,'' Gerry said. His own circuit, the Third, has gone to biennial conferences. a model circuit Wallace said the work of the Ninth Circuit conference has been recognized by other circuits. ``Some of us do a better job than others in our efforts to improve the system,'' Wallace said. If efforts were not made to improve the administration of justice, he added, costs of administering the courts could be higher than they already are. ``The budgeting problem is very complicated,'' Wallace said. ``By singling out one aspect, the overall picture can be blurred. We have thrashed this out. We have been responsible.'' But some circuit judges like Wiggins have complained that the conference is not as productive as Wallace or others may think. ``We don't talk about much of interest to any of us; our discussions are so broad,'' Wiggins told his colleagues in Santa Barbara. At the Santa Barbara meeting, conferees discussed cooperation with the executive and legislative branches and, in addition to passing a resolution calling for a task force to study bias, passed one supporting adequate funding for the courts. Savings in conference costs would not have offset lack of funds for jury trials or public defender programs because those costs come out of different budget lines than the line used to pay for conferences, said Wallace and court spokesman Sellers. This year's conference schedule, like those in the past, included such diversions as tennis and golf tournaments, a spouse sightseeing and winery tour and cooking and flower arranging classes. Wallace confirmed that the Ninth Circuit conference next August will be held at the Loews Coronado Bay Resort on the beach south of San Diego.
